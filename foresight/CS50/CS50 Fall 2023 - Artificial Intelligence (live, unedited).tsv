1255540	1259540	As we eat, we chat and laugh and catch up on each other's day, dot, dot, dot.
1259540	1260540	SA2.
1260540	1263540	My mother packs me a sandwich, a drink, fruit, and a treat.
1263540	1266540	When I get in the lunchroom, I find an empty table and sit there and I eat my lunch.
1266540	1269540	My friends come and sit down with me, dot, dot, dot.
1269540	1271540	Runkshin, should we see what folks think?
1271540	1276540	It looks like most of you think that SA1 was generated by AI.
1276540	1282540	And in fact, if we flip back to the answer here, it was in fact SA1.
1283540	1287540	So it's great that we now already have seemingly this discerning eye,
1287540	1292540	but let me perhaps deflate that enthusiasm by saying it's only going to get harder
1292540	1294540	to discern one from the other.
1294540	1297540	And we're really now on the bleeding edge of what's soon to be possible.
1297540	1301540	But most everyone in this room has probably by now seen, tried,
1301540	1305540	certainly heard of ChatGPT, which is all about textual generation.
1305540	1308540	Within CS50 and within academia more generally,
1308540	1311540	have we been thinking about, talking about, how, whether to use
1311540	1313540	or not use these kinds of technologies.
1313540	1316540	And if the students in the room haven't told the family members in the room already,
1316540	1319540	this here is an excerpt from CS50's own syllabus this year,
1319540	1324540	whereby we have deemed tools like ChatGPT in their current form just too helpful.
1324540	1326540	Sort of like an overzealous friend who, in school,
1326540	1329540	just wants to give you all of the answers instead of leading you to them.
1329540	1336540	And so we simply prohibit by policy using AI-based software such as ChatGPT,
1336540	1339540	third-party tools like GitHub Co-Pilot, Bing Chat, and others,
1339540	1343540	that suggests or completes answers to questions or lines of code.
1343540	1347540	But it would seem reactionary to take away what technology surely has
1347540	1349540	some potential upsides for education.
1349540	1352540	And so within CS50 this semester, as well as this past summer,
1352540	1356540	have we allowed students to use CS50's own AI-based software,
1356540	1359540	which are in effect, as we'll discuss, built on top of these third-party tools,
1359540	1363540	ChatGPT from open AI, companies like Microsoft and beyond.
1363540	1367540	And in fact, what students can now use is this brought-to-life CS50 duck,
1367540	1372540	or DDB, duck debugger within a website of our own, CS50.ai,
1372540	1375540	and another that your students know known as CS50.dev.
1375540	1379540	So students are using it, but in a way where we have tempered the enthusiasm
1379540	1381540	of what might otherwise be an overly helpful duck
1381540	1383540	to model it more akin to a good teacher,
1383540	1386540	a good teaching fellow who might guide you to the answers,
1386540	1388540	but not simply hand them outright.
1388540	1389540	So what does that actually mean?
1389540	1391540	And in what form does this duck come?
1391540	1394540	Well, architecturally, for those of you with engineering backgrounds,
1394540	1396540	they might be curious as to how this is actually implemented.
1396540	1400540	If a student here in the class has a question virtually in this case,
1400540	1405540	they somehow ask these questions of this central web application, CS50.ai.
1405540	1409540	But we, in turn, have built much of our own logic on top of third-party services
1409540	1413540	known as APIs, application programming interfaces,
1413540	1416540	features that other companies provide that people like us can use
1416540	1419540	so as they are doing really a lot of the heavy lifting.
1419540	1421540	The so-called large language models are there.
1421540	1424540	But we, too, have information that is not in these models yet.
1424540	1427540	For instance, the words that came out of my mouth just last week
1427540	1429540	when we had a lecture on some other topic,
1429540	1433540	not to mention all of the past lectures and homework assignments from this year.
1433540	1437540	So we have our own vector database locally via which we can search
1437540	1441540	for more recent information and then hand some of that information into these models,
1441540	1443540	which you might recall, at least for open AI,
1443540	1448540	is cut off as of 2021, as of now, to make the information even more current.
1448540	1450540	So architecturally, that's sort of the flow.
1450540	1455540	But for now, I thought I'd share at a higher level what it is your students are already familiar with
1455540	1459540	and what will soon be more broadly available to our own students online as well.
1459540	1463540	So what we've focused on is what's generally now known as prompt engineering,
1463540	1467540	which isn't really a technical phrase because it's not so much engineering
1467540	1468540	in the traditional sense.
1468540	1473540	It really is just English, what we are largely doing when it comes to giving the AI
1473540	1476540	the personality of a good teacher or a good duck.
1476540	1480540	So what we're doing is giving it what's known as a system prompt nowadays,
1480540	1484540	whereby we write some English sentences, send those English sentences to open AI
1484540	1488540	or Microsoft that sort of teaches it how to behave,
1488540	1490540	not just using its own knowledge out of the box,
1490540	1494540	but coercing it to behave a little more educationally constructively.
1494540	1498540	And so, for instance, a representative snippet of English that we provide to these services
1498540	1500540	looks a little something like this, quote unquote.
1500540	1504540	You are a friendly and supportive teaching assistant for CS50.
1504540	1506540	You are also a rubber duck.
1506540	1510540	You answer student questions only about CS50 in the field of computer science.
1510540	1513540	Do not answer questions about unrelated topics.
1513540	1517540	Do not provide full answers to problem sets as this would violate academic honesty.
1517540	1521540	And so, in essence, and you can sort of do this manually with ChatGPT,
1521540	1523540	you can tell it or ask it how to behave.
1523540	1527540	We essentially are doing this automatically so that it doesn't just hand answers
1527540	1530540	out of the box and knows a little something more about us.
1530540	1533540	There's also in this world of AI right now the notion of a user prompt,
1533540	1535540	versus that system prompt.
1535540	1539540	And the user prompt, in our case, is essentially the student's own question.
1539540	1543540	I have a question about X, or I have a problem with my code here in Y.
1543540	1546540	So we pass to those same API students' own questions
1546540	1548540	as part of this so-called user prompt,
1548540	1551540	just so you're familiar now with some of the vernacular of late.
1551540	1554540	Now, the programming environment that students have been using this whole year
1554540	1557540	is known as Visual Studio Code, a popular open source free product
1557540	1561540	that so many engineers around the world now use.
1561540	1564540	But we've instrumented it to be a little more course specific,
1564540	1569540	with some course specific features that make learning within this environment
1569540	1571540	all the easier.
1571540	1573540	It lives at cs50.dev.
1573540	1577540	And as students in this room know that, as of now, the virtual duck lives
1577540	1581540	within this environment and can do things like explain highlighted lines of code.
1581540	1584540	So here, for instance, is a screenshot of this programming environment.
1584540	1587540	Here is some arcane looking code in a language called C
1587540	1589540	that we've just left behind us in the class.
1590540	1593540	And suppose that you don't understand what one or more of these lines of code do,
1593540	1597540	students can now highlight those lines, right click or control click on it,
1597540	1600540	select explain highlighted code, and voila,
1600540	1605540	they see a chat GPT-like explanation of that very code within a second or so
1605540	1610540	that no human has typed out but that's been dynamically generated based on this code.
1610540	1613540	Other things that the duck can now do for students
1613540	1616540	is advise students on how to improve their code's style,
1616540	1618540	the aesthetics, the formatting thereof.
1618540	1621540	And so, for instance, here is similar code in a language called C
1621540	1623540	and I'll stipulate that it's very messy.
1623540	1627540	Everything is left aligned instead of nicely indented so it looks a little more structured.
1627540	1629540	Students can now click a button.
1629540	1632540	They'll see at the right hand side in green how their code should ideally look
1632540	1635540	and if they're not quite sure what those changes are or why,
1635540	1637540	they can click on explain changes.
1637540	1640540	And similarly, the duck advises them on how and why
1640540	1645540	to turn their not great code into greater code from left to right respectively.
1645540	1648540	More compellingly and more generalizable beyond CS50
1648540	1651540	and beyond computer science is AI's ability to answer
1651540	1654540	most of the questions that students might now ask online.
1654540	1656540	And we've been doing asynchronous Q&A for years
1656540	1659540	via various mobile or web applications and the like,
1659540	1661540	but to date it has been humans,
1661540	1664540	myself included responding to all of those questions.
1664540	1668540	Now the duck has an opportunity to chime in generally within three seconds
1668540	1672540	because we've integrated into an online Q&A tool that students in CS50
1672540	1674540	and elsewhere across Harvard have long used.
1674540	1678540	So here's an anonymized screenshot of a question from an actual student
1678540	1681540	but written here as John Harvard who asked this summer
1681540	1684540	in the summer version of CS50, what is flask exactly?
1684540	1687540	So fairly definitional question and here is what the duck spit out
1687540	1690540	thanks to that architecture I described before.
1690540	1692540	I'll stipulate that this is correct,
1692540	1696540	but it is mostly a definition akin to what Google or Bing could already give you last year,
1696540	1700540	but here's a more nuanced question for instance from another anonymized students.
1700540	1704540	In this question here the students including an error message that they're seeing,
1704540	1709540	they're asking about that and they're asking a little more broadly and qualitatively
1709540	1712540	is there a more efficient way to write this code?
1712540	1715540	A question that really is best answered based on experience.
1715540	1718540	Here I'll stipulate that the duck responded with this answer
1718540	1720540	which is actually pretty darn good,
1720540	1723540	not only responding in English but with some sample starter code
1723540	1725540	that would make sense in this context
1725540	1729540	and at the bottom it's worth noting because none of this technology is perfect
1729540	1732540	just yet, it's still indeed very bleeding edge
1732540	1736540	and so what we have chosen to do within CS50 is include disclaimers like this.
1736540	1738540	I am an experimental bot, quack.
1738540	1744540	Do not assume that my reply is accurate unless you see that it's been endorsed by humans staff, quack.
1744540	1747540	And in fact at top right the mechanism we've been using in this tool
1747540	1750540	is usually within minutes a human whether it's a teaching fellow,
1750540	1753540	course assistant or myself, we'll click on a button like this
1753540	1757540	to signal to our human students that yes, like the duck is spot on here
1757540	1761540	or we have an opportunity as always to chime in with our own responses.
1761540	1764540	Frankly that disclaimer, that button will soon I do think go away
1764540	1766540	as the software gets better and better,
1766540	1770540	but for now that's how we're modulating exactly what students' expectations might be
1770540	1773540	when it comes to correctness or incorrectness.
1773540	1776540	It's common to in programming to see a lot of error messages
1776540	1778540	certainly when you're learning first hand.
1778540	1782540	A lot of these error messages are cane, confusing certainly to students
1782540	1784540	versus the people who wrote them.
1784540	1788540	We'll see a box like this whenever one of their terminal window programs airs,
1788540	1793540	they'll be assisted to with English like TF like support
1793540	1796540	when it comes to explaining what it is that went wrong with that command.
1796540	1800540	And ultimately what this is really doing for students in our own experience already
1800540	1804540	is providing them really with virtual office hours and 24 seven,
1804540	1807540	which is actually quite compelling in a university environment
1807540	1809540	where students schedules are already tightly packed,
1809540	1812540	be it with academics, the curriculars, athletics and the like,
1812540	1815540	and they might have enough time to dive into a homework assignment,
1815540	1817540	maybe eight hours even for something sizable,
1817540	1820540	but if they hit that wall a couple of hours in,
1820540	1823540	yeah, they can go to office hours or they can ask a question
1823540	1827540	asynchronously online, but it's really not optimal in the moment support
1827540	1831540	that we can now provide all the more effectively we hope through software as well.
1831540	1834540	So if you're curious, even if you're not a technophile yourself,
1834540	1838540	anyone on the internet can go to cs50.ai and experiment with this user interface.
1838540	1841540	This one here actually resembles chat GPT itself,
1841540	1844540	but it's specific to cs50.
1844540	1848540	And here again is just a sequence of screenshots that I'll stipulate for today's purposes
1848540	1852540	are pretty darn good and akin to what I myself or a teaching fellow would reply to
1852540	1857540	and answer to a student's question in this case about their particular code.
1857540	1859540	And ultimately it's really aspirational.
1859540	1864540	The goal here ultimately is to really approximate a one to one teacher to student ratio,
1864540	1868540	which despite all of the resources we within cs50, we within Harvard
1868540	1872540	and places like Yale have, we certainly have never had enough resources
1872540	1876540	to approximate what might really be ideal, which is more of an apprenticeship model,
1876540	1880540	a mentorship whereby it's just you and that teacher working one on one.
1880540	1883540	Now we still have humans and the goal is not to reduce that human support,
1883540	1888540	but to focus it all the more consciously on the students who would benefit most
1888540	1892540	from some impersonal one-on-one support versus students who would happily take it
1892540	1895540	at any hour of the day more digitally via online.
1895540	1899540	And in fact, we're still in the process of evaluating just how well or not well all of this works,
1899540	1903540	but based on our summer experiment alone with about 70 students a few months back,
1903540	1907540	one student wrote us at term's end, it felt like having a personal tutor.
1907540	1911540	I love how AI bots will answer questions without ego and without judgment,
1911540	1916540	generally entertaining even the stupidest of questions without treating them like they're stupid.
1916540	1922540	It has an, as one could expect, ironically, an inhuman level of patience.
1922540	1928540	And so I thought that's telling as to how even one student is perceiving these new possibilities.
1928540	1932540	So let's consider now more academically what it is that's enabling those kinds of tools,
1932540	1936540	not just within CS50, within computer science, but really the world more generally.
1936540	1940540	What the whole world's been talking about is generative artificial intelligence,
1940540	1946540	AI that can generate images, generate text and sort of mimic the behavior of what we think of as human.
1946540	1948540	So what does that really mean?
1948540	1950540	Well, let's start really at the beginning.
1950540	1953540	Artificial intelligence is actually a technique, a technology,
1953540	1955540	a subject that's actually been with us for some time,
1955540	1962540	but it really was the introduction of this very user-friendly interface known as chatGPT
1962540	1966540	and some of the more recent academic work over really just the past five or six years
1966540	1969540	that really allowed us to take a massive leap forward,
1969540	1972540	it would seem technologically, as to what these things can now do.
1972540	1974540	So what is artificial intelligence?
1974540	1977540	It's been with us for some time and it's honestly so omnipresent
1977540	1979540	that we sort of take it for granted nowadays.
1979540	1982540	Gmail outlook have gotten really good at spam detection.
1982540	1984540	If you haven't checked your spam folder in a while,
1984540	1988540	that's testament to just how good they seem to be at getting it out of your inbox.
1988540	1991540	Handwriting recognition has been with us for some time.
1991540	1995540	I daresay it too is only getting better and better the more the software is able to adapt
1995540	1998540	to different handwriting styles such as this.
1998540	2002540	Recommendation histories and the like, whether using Netflix or any other service,
2002540	2006540	have gotten better and better at recommending things you might like based on things
2006540	2010540	you have liked and maybe based on things other people who like the same thing
2010540	2012540	as you might have liked.
2012540	2014540	And suffice it to say, there's no one at Netflix,
2014540	2016540	akin to the old like VHS stores of yesteryear,
2016540	2020540	who are recommending to you specifically what movie you might like
2020540	2025540	and there's no code, no algorithm that says if they like X, then recommend Y.
2025540	2028540	Elts recommend Z because there's just too many movies, too many people,
2028540	2030540	too many different tastes in the world.
2030540	2034540	So AI is increasingly sort of looking for patterns that might not even be obvious
2034540	2037540	to us humans and dynamically figuring out what might be good for me,
2037540	2040540	for you, or you, or anyone else.
2040540	2044540	Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, any of these voice recognition tools
2044540	2049540	that are answering questions that too suffice it to say is all powered by AI.
2049540	2052540	But let's start with something a little simpler than any of those applications
2052540	2055540	and this is one of the first arcade games from yesteryear known as Pong
2055540	2059540	and it's sort of like table tennis and person on the left can move their paddle up and down.
2059540	2063540	Personal on the right can do the same and the goal is to get the ball past the other person.
2063540	2067540	Or conversely, make sure it hits your paddle and bounces back.
2067540	2072540	Well, somewhat simpler than this and so far as it can be one player is another Atari game
2072540	2075540	from yesteryear known as Breakout whereby you're essentially just trying to bang the ball
2075540	2080540	against the bricks to get more and more points and get rid of all of those bricks.
2080540	2084540	But all of us in this room probably have a human instinct for how to win this game
2084540	2086540	or at least how to play this game.
2086540	2091540	For instance, if the ball pictured here back in the 80s as a single red dot
2091540	2095540	just left the paddle pictured here is a red line,
2095540	2098540	where is the ball presumably going to go next?
2098540	2103540	And in turn, which direction should I slide my paddle to the left or to the right?
2103540	2108540	So presumably to the left and we all have an eye for what seem to be the digital physics of that
2108540	2112540	and indeed that would then be an algorithm sort of step by step instructions
2112540	2114540	for solving some problem.
2114540	2118540	So how can we now translate that human intuition to what we describe more as artificial intelligence
2118540	2121540	not nearly as sophisticated as those other applications,
2121540	2123540	but will indeed start with some basics?
2123540	2127540	You might know from economics or strategic thinking or computer science
2127540	2131540	this idea of a decision tree that allows you to decide should I go this way or this way
2131540	2133540	when it comes to making a decision.
2133540	2138540	So let's consider how we could draw a picture to represent even something simplistic like Breakout.
2138540	2142540	Well, if the ball is left of the paddle is a question or a boolean expression
2142540	2144540	I might ask myself in code.
2144540	2148540	If yes, then I should move my paddle left as most everyone just said.
2148540	2152540	Else, if the ball is not left of paddle, what do I want to do?
2152540	2154540	Well, I want to ask a question.
2154540	2156540	I don't want to just instinctively go right.
2156540	2158540	I want to check is the ball to the right of the paddle.
2158540	2162540	And if yes, well then yes, go ahead and move the paddle right.
2162540	2166540	But there is a third situation which is right.
2166540	2167540	Like don't move.
2167540	2168540	It's coming right at you.
2168540	2169540	So that would be the third scenario here.
2169540	2171540	No, it's not to the right or to the left.
2171540	2172540	So just don't move the paddle.
2172540	2174540	You got lucky and it's coming, for instance, straight down.
2174540	2178540	So Breakout is fairly straightforward when it comes to an algorithm.
2178540	2183540	And we can actually translate this as any CS50 student now could to code or pseudocode,
2183540	2187540	sort of English like code that's independent of Java, C, C++,
2187540	2189540	and all of the programming languages of today.
2189540	2194540	So in English, pseudocode, while a game is ongoing, if the ball is left of paddle,
2194540	2196540	I should move paddle left.
2196540	2201540	Else, if ball is right of the paddle, I should say paddle, that's a bug, not intended today,
2201540	2203540	move paddle right.
2203540	2205540	Else, don't move the paddle.
2205540	2211540	So that too represents a translation of this intuition to code that's very deterministic.
2211540	2214540	You can sort of anticipate all possible scenarios, capture it in code.
2214540	2217540	And frankly, this should be the most boring game of Breakout
2217540	2221540	because the paddle should just perfectly play this game assuming there's no variables
2221540	2224540	or randomness when it comes to speed or angles or the like,
2224540	2227540	which real world games certainly try to introduce.
2227540	2230540	But let's consider another game from yesteryear that you might play with your kids today
2230540	2232540	or you did yourself growing up.
2232540	2233540	Here's Tic Tac Toe.
2233540	2237540	And for those unfamiliar, the goal is to get three O's in a row or three X's in a row,
2237540	2240540	vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
2240540	2243540	So suppose it's now X's turn.
2243540	2247540	If you've played Tic Tac Toe, most of you probably just have an immediate instinct
2247540	2252540	as to where X should probably go so that it doesn't lose instantaneously.
2252540	2256540	But let's consider, in the more general case, how do you solve Tic Tac Toe?
2256540	2260540	Frankly, if you're in the habit of losing Tic Tac Toe, but you're not trying to lose Tic Toe,
2260540	2262540	you're actually playing it wrong.
2262540	2265540	Like you should minimally be able to always force a tie in Tic Tac Toe,
2265540	2268540	and better yet, you should be able to beat the other person.
2268540	2271540	So hopefully, everyone now will soon walk away with this strategy.
2271540	2274540	So how can we borrow inspiration from those same decision trees
2274540	2276540	and do something similar here?
2276540	2281540	So if you, the player, ask yourself, can I get three in a row on this turn?
2281540	2285540	Well, if yes, then you should do that and play the X in that position.
2285540	2287540	Play in the square to get three in a row.
2287540	2288540	Straight forward.
2288540	2291540	If you can't get three in a row in this turn, you should ask another question.
2291540	2294540	Can my opponent get three in a row in their next turn?
2294540	2299540	Because then you better preempt that by moving into that position.
2299540	2304540	Play in the square to block opponent three's three in a row.
2304540	2306540	What if, though, that's not the case?
2306540	2309540	What if there aren't even that many X's and O's on the board?
2309540	2311540	If you're in the habit of just kind of playing randomly,
2311540	2315540	like your mate might not be playing optimally as a good AI could.
2315540	2317540	So if no, it's kind of a question mark.
2317540	2321540	In fact, there's probably more to this tree because we could think through,
2321540	2322540	what if I go there?
2322540	2324540	Wait a minute, what if I go there or there or there?
2324540	2327540	You can start to think a few steps ahead as a computer could do much better
2327540	2328540	even than us humans.
2328540	2330540	So suppose, for instance, it's O's turn.
2330540	2334540	Now, those of you who are very good at Tecto might have an instinct for where to go,
2334540	2336540	but this is an even harder problem, it would seem.
2336540	2340540	I could go in eight possible places if I'm O, but let's try to break that down
2340540	2343540	more algorithmically as an AI would.
2343540	2346540	And let's recognize, too, that with games in particular,
2346540	2350540	one of the reasons that AI was so early adopted in these games,
2350540	2355540	playing the CPU, is that games really lend themselves to defining them
2355540	2359540	if taking the fun out of it mathematically, defining them in terms of inputs
2359540	2363540	and outputs, maybe paddle moving left or right, ball moving up or down.
2363540	2366540	You can really quantize it at a very boring low level,
2366540	2369540	but that lends itself then to solving it optimally.
2369540	2375540	And in fact, with most games, the goal is to maximize or maybe minimize some math function.
2375540	2378540	Most games, if you have scores, the goal is to maximize your score
2378540	2380540	and indeed get a high score.
2380540	2385540	So games lend themselves to a nice translation to mathematics
2385540	2387540	and in turn hear AI solutions.
2387540	2391540	So one of the first algorithms one might learn in the class on algorithms
2391540	2394540	and on artificial intelligence is something called Minimax,
2394540	2398540	which alludes to this idea of trying to minimize and or maximize something
2398540	2400540	as your function, your goal.
2400540	2404540	And it actually derives inspiration from these same decision trees
2404540	2405540	that we've been talking about.
2405540	2406540	But first, a definition.
2406540	2409540	Here are three representative Tic Tac Toe boards.
2409540	2412540	Here is one in which O has clearly won per the green.
2412540	2415540	Here is one in which X has clearly won per the green.
2415540	2417540	And this one in the middle just represents a draw.
2417540	2420540	Now, there's a bunch of other ways that Tic Tac Toe could end,
2420540	2422540	but here's just three representative ones.
2422540	2426540	But let's make Tic Tac Toe even more boring than it might have always struck you as.
2426540	2431540	Let's propose that this kind of configuration should have a score of negative one.
2431540	2433540	If O wins, it's a negative one.
2433540	2435540	If X wins, it's a positive one.
2435540	2437540	And if no one wins, we'll call it a zero.
2437540	2441540	We need some way of talking about and reasoning about which of these outcomes
2441540	2445540	is better than the other and what's simpler than zero, one, and negative one.
2445540	2449540	So the goal, though, of X, it would seem, is to maximize its score.
2449540	2452540	But the goal of O is to minimize its score.
2452540	2454540	So X is really trying to get positive one.
2454540	2456540	O is really trying to get negative one.
2456540	2460540	And no one really wants zero, but that's better than losing to the other person.
2460540	2463540	So we have now a way to define what it means to win or lose.
2463540	2466540	Well, now we can employ a strategy here.
2466540	2470540	Here, just as a quick check, what would the score be of this board?
2470540	2472540	Just so everyone's on the same page?
2472540	2476540	Or so one, because X has won and we just stipulated arbitrarily,
2476540	2478540	this means that this board has a value of one.
2478540	2480540	Now let's put it into one more interesting context.
2480540	2483540	Here, a game has been played for a few moves already.
2483540	2484540	There's two spots left.
2484540	2486540	No one has won just yet.
2486540	2489540	And suppose that it's O's turn now.
2489540	2491540	Now everyone probably has an instinct already as to where to go,
2491540	2494540	but let's try to break this down more algorithmically.
2494540	2496540	So what is the value of this board?
2496540	2499540	Well, we don't know yet because no one has won.
2499540	2502540	So let's consider what could happen next.
2502540	2505540	So we can draw this actually as a tree as before.
2505540	2509540	Here, for instance, is what might happen if O goes into the top left-hand corner.
2509540	2514540	And here's what might happen if O goes into the bottom middle spot instead.
2514540	2516540	We should ask ourselves, what's the value of this board?
2516540	2517540	What's the value of this board?
2517540	2520540	Because if O's purpose in life is to minimize its score,
2520540	2525540	it's going to go left or right based on whichever yields the smallest number, negative one, ideally.
2525540	2530540	But we're still not sure yet because we don't have definitions for boards with holes in them like this.
2530540	2532540	So what could happen next here?
2532540	2534540	Well, it's obviously going to be X's turn next.
2534540	2538540	So if X moves, unfortunately, X has won in this configuration.
2538540	2543540	We can now conclude that the value of this board is what number?
2543540	2548540	So one, and because there's only one way to reach this board by transitivity,
2548540	2552540	you might as well think of the value of this previous board as also one,
2552540	2555540	because no matter what, it's going to lead to that same outcome.
2555540	2559540	And so the value of this board is actually still to be determined
2559540	2562540	because we don't know if O's going to want to go with the one,
2562540	2564540	and probably not because that means X wins.
2564540	2566540	But let's see what the value of this board is.
2566540	2570540	Well, suppose that indeed X goes in that top left corner here.
2570540	2573540	What's the value of this board here?
2573540	2575540	Zero because no one has won.
2575540	2577540	There's no X's or O's three in a row.
2577540	2579540	So the value of this board is zero.
2579540	2581540	There's only one way logically to get there.
2581540	2584540	So we might as well think of the value of this board as also zero.
2584540	2587540	And so now what's the value of this board?
2587540	2590540	Well, if we started the story by thinking about O's turn,
2590540	2595540	O's purpose is the min in minimax, then which move is O going to make?
2595540	2598540	Go to the left or go to the right?
2598540	2604540	O's probably going to go to the right and make the move that leads to this board
2604540	2609540	because even though O can't win in this configuration, at least X didn't win.
2609540	2613540	So it's minimized its score relatively, even though it's not a clean win.
2613540	2617540	Now, this is all fine and good for a configuration of the board that's almost done.
2617540	2619540	There's only two moves left. The game's about to end.
2619540	2624540	But if you kind of expand in your mind's eye, how did we get to this branch of the decision tree?
2624540	2628540	If we rewind one step where there's three possible moves,
2628540	2630540	frankly, the decision tree is a lot bigger.
2630540	2635540	If we run further in your mind's eye and have four moves left or five moves or all nine moves left,
2635540	2637540	imagine just zooming out, out, and out.
2637540	2640540	This is becoming a massive, massive tree of decisions.
2640540	2645540	Now, even so, here is that same sub tree, the same decision tree we just looked at.
2645540	2649540	This is the exact same thing, but I shrunk the font so that it appears here on the screen here.
2649540	2654540	But over here, we have what could happen if instead, it's actually X's turn
2654540	2660540	because we're once moved prior, there's a bunch of different moves X could now make too.
2660540	2661540	So what is the implication of this?
2661540	2666540	Well, most humans are not thinking through tic-tac-toe to this extreme.
2666540	2669540	And frankly, most of us probably just don't have the mental capacity to think about,
2669540	2672540	like, going left and then right and then left and then right.
2672540	2674540	This is not how people play tic-tac-toe.
2674540	2677540	Like, we're not using that much memory, so to speak.
2677540	2679540	But a computer can handle that.
2679540	2681540	And computers can play tic-tac-toe optimally.
2681540	2685540	So if you're beating a computer at tic-tac-toe, like, it's not implemented very well.
2685540	2690540	It's not following this very logical deterministic minimax algorithm.
2690540	2696540	But this is where now AI is no longer as simple as just doing what these decision trees say.
2696540	2700540	In the context of tic-tac-toe, here's how we might translate this to code, for instance.
2700540	2704540	If player is x, for each possible move, calculate a score for the board,
2704540	2708540	as we were doing verbally, and then choose the move with the highest score,
2708540	2711540	because x's goal is to maximize its score.
2711540	2715540	If the player is O, though, for each possible move, calculate a score for the board
2715540	2718540	and then choose the move with the lowest score.
2718540	2722540	So that's a distillation of that verbal walkthrough into what CS50 students know now as code,
2722540	2724540	or at least pseudocode.
2724540	2728540	But the problem with games, not so much tic-tac-toe,
2728540	2730540	but other more sophisticated games is this.
2730540	2736540	Does anyone want to ballpark how many possible ways there are to play tic-tac-toe?
2736540	2741540	Paper pencil, two human children, how long could you keep them occupied
2741540	2745540	playing tic-tac-toe in different ways?
2745540	2747540	If you actually think through how big does this tree get,
2747540	2751540	how many leaves are there on this decision tree, like how many different directions?
2751540	2756540	Well, if you're thinking 255,168, you are correct.
2756540	2761540	And now most of us in our lifetime have probably not played tic-tac-toe that many times.
2761540	2763540	So think about how many games you've been missing out on.
2763540	2767540	There are different decisions you could have been making all these years.
2767540	2771540	Now that's a big number, but honestly, like that's not a big number for a computer.
2771540	2775540	That's a few megabytes of memory maybe to sort of keep all of that in mind
2775540	2780540	and sort of implement that kind of code in C or Java or C++ or something else.
2780540	2783540	But other games are much more complicated.
2783540	2787540	And the games that you and I might play as we get older include maybe chess.
2787540	2792540	And if you think about chess with only the first four moves back and forth four times,
2792540	2795540	so only four moves, that's not even a very long game.
2795540	2800540	Anyone want to ballpark how many different ways there are to begin a game of chess
2800540	2805540	with four moves back and forth?
2805540	2808540	This is evidence as to why chess is apparently so hard.
2808540	2814540	288 million ways, which is why when you are really good at chess,
2814540	2818540	you are really good at chess, because apparently you either have an intuition for
2818540	2822540	or a mind for thinking it would seem so many more steps ahead than your opponent.
2822540	2824540	And don't get us started on something like Go.
2824540	2829540	266 quintillion ways to play Go's first four moves.
2829540	2833540	So at this point, we just can't pull out our Mac, our PC,
2833540	2837540	certainly not our phone to solve optimally games like chess and Go
2837540	2839540	because we don't have big enough CPUs.
2839540	2840540	We don't have enough memory.
2840540	2845540	We don't have enough years in our lifetimes for the computers to crunch all of those numbers.
2845540	2852540	And thus was born a different form of AI that's more inspired by finding patterns more dynamically.
2852540	2856540	Learning from data as opposed to being told by humans,
2856540	2859540	here is the code via which to solve this problem.
2859540	2862540	So machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence
2862540	2866540	that tries instead to get machines to learn what they should do
2866540	2870540	without being so coached step by step by step by humans here.
2870540	2873540	Reinforcement learning, for instance, is one such example thereof,
2873540	2877540	wherein reinforcement learning, you sort of wait for the computer or maybe a robot
2877540	2880540	to maybe just get better and better and better at things.
2880540	2882540	And as it does, you reward it with a reward function.
2882540	2885540	Give it plus one every time it does something well and maybe minus one.
2885540	2888540	You punish it any time it does something poorly.
2888540	2893540	And if you simply program this AI or this robot to maximize its score,
2893540	2895540	never mind minimizing, maximize its score.
2895540	2898540	Ideally, it should repeat behaviors that got it plus one.
2898540	2902540	It should decrease the frequency with which it does bad behaviors that got it negative one.
2902540	2905540	And you can reinforce this kind of learning.
2905540	2908540	In fact, I have here one demonstration.
2908540	2914540	Could a student come on up who does not think they are particularly coordinated?
2914540	2917540	OK, wow, you're being nominated by your friends.
2917540	2919540	Come on up, come on up.
2919540	2924540	Their hands went up instantly for you.
2924540	2929540	OK, what is your name?
2929540	2931540	My name is Amaka.
2931540	2933540	Amaka, do you want to introduce yourself to the world?
2933540	2934540	Hi, my name is Amaka.
2934540	2938540	I am a first year in Hallworthy, planning to concentrate in CS.
2938540	2939540	Wonderful, nice to see you.
2939540	2940540	Come on over here.
2940540	2946540	So, yes, oh no, it's sort of like a game show here.
2946540	2951540	We have a pan here with what appears to be something pancake-like.
2951540	2956540	And we'd like to teach you how to flip a pancake so that when you gesture upward,
2956540	2959540	the pancake should flip around so you cook the other side.
2959540	2965540	So we're going to reward you verbally with plus one or minus one.
2965540	2969540	Minus one, minus one.
2969540	2971540	OK, plus one, plus one.
2971540	2973540	So do more of that.
2973540	2975540	Minus one, minus one.
2975540	2978540	Minus one, minus one.
2978540	2983540	Do less of that.
2983540	2987540	All right, a big round of applause.
2987540	2988540	Thank you.
2988540	2991540	We've been in the habit of handing out Super Mario Brothers Oreos this year.
2991540	2997540	So thank you for participating.
2997540	3002540	So this is actually a good example of an opportunity for reinforcement learning
3002540	3005540	and wonderfully a researcher has posted a video that we thought we'd share.
3005540	3009540	It's about a minute and a half long where you can watch a robot now do exactly
3009540	3013540	what our wonderful human volunteer here just attempted as well.
3013540	3017540	So let me go ahead and play this on the screen and give you a sense of what
3017540	3019540	the human and the robot are doing together.
3019540	3023540	So their pancake looks a little similar there.
3023540	3028540	The human here is going to first sort of train the robot what to do by showing it some gestures.
3028540	3030540	But there's no one right way to do this.
3030540	3033540	But the human seems to know how to do it pretty well in this case.
3033540	3039540	And so it's trying to give the machine examples of how to flip a pancake successfully.
3039540	3041540	But now this is the very first trial.
3041540	3042540	OK, look from that.
3042540	3044540	You're in good company.
3044540	3048540	After three trials.
3048540	3051540	OK.
3051540	3053540	OK.
3053540	3057540	Now 10 tries.
3057540	3060540	There's the human picking up the pancake.
3060540	3066540	After 11 trials.
3066540	3069540	And meanwhile there's presumably a human coding this in the sense that
3069540	3075540	someone is saying good job or bad job plus one or minus one.
3075540	3078540	20 trials.
3078540	3081540	Here now we'll see how the computer knows what it's even doing.
3081540	3084540	There's just a mapping to some kind of like XYZ coordinate system.
3084540	3087540	So the robot can quantize what is it's doing.
3087540	3090540	Nice to do more of one thing less of another.
3090540	3095540	And you're just seeing a visualization in the background of those digitized movements.
3095540	3099540	And so now after 50 some odd trials.
3099540	3106540	The robot to has got its spot on and it should be able to repeat this again and again and again in order to keep flipping this pancake.
3106540	3110540	So our human volunteer wonderfully took you even fewer trials.
3110540	3120540	But this is an example then to be clear of what we'd call reinforcement learning whereby you're reinforcing a behavior you want or negatively reinforcing that is punishing a behavior that you don't.
3120540	3124540	Here's another example that brings us back into the realm of games a little bit.
3124540	3134540	But in a very abstract way if we were playing a game like the floor is lava where you're only supposed to step certain places so that you don't fall through in the lava pit or something like that and lose a point or lose a life.
3134540	3136540	Each of these squares might represent a position.
3136540	3141540	This yellow dot might represent the human player that can go up down left or right within this world.
3141540	3144540	I'm revealing to the whole audience where the lava pits are.
3144540	3147540	But the goal for this yellow dot is to get to green.
3147540	3153540	But the yellow dot as in any good game does not have this bird's eye view and knows from the get go exactly where to go.
3153540	3155540	It's going to have to try some trial and error.
3155540	3160540	But if we the programmers maybe reinforce good behavior or punish bad behavior,
3160540	3170540	we can sort of teach this yellow dot without giving it step by step up down left right instructions what behaviors to repeat and what behaviors not to repeat.
3170540	3174540	So for instance suppose the robot moves right that was bad you fell in the lava already.
3174540	3179540	So we'll use a bit of computer memory to sort of draw a thicker red line there.
3179540	3180540	Don't do that again.
3180540	3181540	So negative one so to speak.
3181540	3188540	Maybe the yellow dot moves up next time we can reward that behavior by not drawing any walls and allowing it to go again.
3188540	3190540	It's making pretty good progress, but oh darn it.
3190540	3193540	It took a right turn and now fell into the lava.
3193540	3196540	But let's use a bit more of the computer's memory and keep track of that.
3196540	3198540	Okay, do not do that thing anymore.
3198540	3201540	Maybe the next time the human dot goes this way.
3201540	3205540	We want to punish that behavior so we'll remember as much with that red line.
3205540	3209540	But now we're starting to make progress until now we hit this one.
3209540	3216540	And eventually even though the yellow dot much like our human much like our pancake flipping robot had to try again and again and again.
3216540	3222540	After enough trials, it's going to start to realize what behaviors it should repeat and which ones it shouldn't.
3222540	3226540	And so in this case, maybe it finally makes its way up to the green dot.
3226540	3232540	And just to recap, once it finds that path, now we can sort of remember it forever as with these green thicker lines.
3232540	3240540	Anytime you want to leave this map, anytime you get really good at the Nintendo game, you'll follow that same path again and again so you don't fall into the lava.
3240540	3245540	But an astute human observer might realize that yes, this is correct.
3245540	3247540	It's getting out of this so-called maze.
3247540	3250540	But what is suboptimal or bad about this solution?
3250540	3251540	Sure.
3254540	3255540	Exactly.
3255540	3261540	It's taking a really long time and inefficient way to get there because I dare say if we just try to different path occasionally,
3261540	3267540	maybe we could get lucky and get to the out the exit quicker and maybe that means we get a higher score.
3267540	3269540	We get rewarded even more.
3269540	3275540	So within a lot of artificial intelligence algorithms, there's this idea of exploring versus exploiting,
3275540	3280540	whereby you should occasionally, yes, exploit the knowledge you already have.
3280540	3285540	In fact, frequently exploit that knowledge, but occasionally you know what you should probably do is explore just a little bit.
3285540	3291540	Take a left instead of a right and see if it leads you to the solution even more quickly and you might find a better and better solution.
3291540	3294540	So here mathematically is how we might think of this.
3294540	3298540	10% of the time, we might say that epsilon, just some variable,
3298540	3303540	sort of a sprinkling of salt into the algorithm here, epsilon will be like 10% of the time.
3303540	3308540	So if my robot or my player picks a random number that's less than 10%,
3308540	3310540	that's going to make a random move.
3310540	3313540	Go left instead of right, even if you really typically go right.
3313540	3317540	Otherwise, make the move with the highest value as we've learned over time.
3317540	3324540	And what the robot might learn then is that we could actually go via this path which gets us to the output faster.
3324540	3325540	We get a higher score.
3325540	3326540	We do it in less time.
3326540	3327540	It's a win-win.
3327540	3331540	Frankly, this really resonates with me because I've been in the habit as maybe some of you are.
3331540	3335540	When you go to a restaurant, maybe that you really like, you find a dish you really like,
3335540	3342540	I will never again know what other dishes that restaurant offers because I'm sort of locally, optimally happy with the dish I've chosen.
3342540	3348540	And I will never know if there's an even better dish at that restaurant unless again I sort of sprinkle a little bit of epsilon,
3348540	3352540	a little bit of randomness into my game playing, my dining out.
3352540	3355540	The catch, of course, though, is that I might be punished.
3355540	3359540	I might therefore sort of be less happy if I pick something and I don't like it.
3359540	3364540	So there's this tension between exploring and exploiting, but in general in computer science and especially in AI,
3364540	3370540	adding a little bit of randomness, especially over time, can in fact yield better and better outcomes.
3370540	3376540	But now there's this notion all the more of deep learning whereby you're trying to infer to detect patterns,
3376540	3381540	figure out how to solve problems, even if the AI has never seen those problems before.
3381540	3386540	And even if there's no human there to reinforce positive or negatively behavior,
3386540	3392540	maybe it's just too complex of a problem for a human to stand alongside the robot and say good or bad job.
3392540	3398540	So with deep learning, they're actually very much related to what you might know as neural networks inspired by human physiology,
3398540	3403540	whereby inside of our brains and elsewhere in our brain, there's lots of these neurons here that can send electrical signals
3403540	3406540	to sort of make movements happen from brain to extremities.
3406540	3411540	You might have two of these via which signals can be transmitted over larger distance.
3411540	3420540	And so computer scientists for some time have drawn inspiration from these neurons to create in software what we call neural networks,
3420540	3428540	whereby there's inputs to these networks and there's outputs from these networks that represents inputs to problems and solutions there too.
3428540	3434540	So let me abstract away the more biological diagrams with just circles that represent nodes or neurons in this case.
3434540	3439540	This would be, we'd call in CS50, the input. This is what we would call the output,
3439540	3442540	but this is very simplistic, very simple neural network.
3442540	3449540	This might be more common whereby the network, the AI takes two inputs to a problem and tries to give you one solution.
3449540	3451540	Well, let's make this more real.
3451540	3456540	For instance, suppose that just for the sake of discussion,
3456540	3462540	here is like a grid that you might see in math class with a y-axis and an x-axis vertically and horizontally respectively.
3462540	3465540	Suppose there's a couple of blue and red dots in that world,
3465540	3476540	and suppose that our goal computationally is to predict whether a dot is going to be blue or red based on its position within that coordinate system.
3476540	3479540	And maybe this represents some real world notion.
3479540	3481540	Maybe it's something like rain that we're trying to predict,
3481540	3483540	but we're doing it more simply with colors right now.
3483540	3489540	So here's my y-axis, here's my x-axis, and effectively my neural network you can think of conceptually as this.
3489540	3493540	It's some kind of implementation of software where there's two inputs to the problem.
3493540	3500540	Give me an x, give me a y value, and this neural network will output red or blue as its prediction.
3500540	3502540	Well, how does it know whether to predict red or blue,
3502540	3509540	especially if no human has painstakingly written code to say when you see a dot here, conclude that it's red?
3509540	3514540	When you see a dot here conclude that it's blue, how can an AI just learn dynamically to solve problems?
3514540	3517540	Well, what might be a reasonable heuristic here?
3517540	3520540	Honestly, this is probably a first approximation that's pretty good.
3520540	3524540	If anything's to the left of that line, let the neural network conclude that it's going to be blue.
3524540	3527540	And if it's to the right of the line, let it conclude that it's going to be red.
3527540	3534540	Until such time as there's more training data, more real world data that gets us to rethink our assumptions.
3534540	3538540	So for instance, if there's a third dot there, oh, clearly a straight line is not sufficient.
3538540	3543540	So maybe it's more of a diagonal line that splits the blue from the red world here.
3543540	3545540	Meanwhile, here's even more dots.
3545540	3547540	And it's actually getting harder now.
3547540	3549540	Like this line is still pretty good.
3549540	3550540	Most of the blue is up here.
3550540	3552540	Most of the red is down here.
3552540	3558540	And this is why if we fast forward to today, AI is often very good but not perfect at solving problems.
3558540	3560540	But what is it we're looking at here?
3560540	3563540	And what is this neural network really trying to figure out?
3563540	3566540	Well, again, at the risk of taking some fun out of red and blue dots,
3566540	3570540	you can think of this neural network as indeed having these neurons,
3570540	3573540	which represent inputs here and outputs here.
3573540	3580540	And then what's happening inside of the computer's memory is that it's trying to figure out what the weight of this arrow or edge should be.
3580540	3583540	What the weight of this arrow or edge should be.
3583540	3587540	And maybe there's another variable there like plus or minus C that just tweaks the prediction.
3587540	3591540	So x and y are literally going to be numbers in this scenario.
3591540	3594540	And the output of this neural network ideally is just true or false.
3594540	3596540	Is it red or blue?
3596540	3599540	So it's sort of a binary state as we discuss a lot in CS50.
3599540	3602540	So here, too, to take the sort of fun out of the pretty picture,
3602540	3604540	it's really just like a high school math function.
3604540	3613540	What the neural network in this example is trying to figure out is what formula of the form AX plus BY plus C is going to be arbitrarily greater than zero.
3613540	3618540	And if so, let's conclude that the dot is red if you get back a positive result.
3618540	3622540	If you don't, let's conclude that the dot is going to be blue instead.
3622540	3628540	So really what you're trying to do is figure out dynamically what numbers do we have to tweak these parameters inside of the neural network?
3628540	3632540	That just give us the answer we want based on all of this data.
3632540	3636540	More generally, though, this would be really representative of deep learning.
3636540	3638540	It's not as simple as input, input, output.
3638540	3641540	There's actually a lot of these nodes, these neurons.
3641540	3642540	There's a lot of these edges.
3642540	3650540	There's a lot of numbers and math are going on that, frankly, even the computer scientists using these neural networks don't necessarily know what they even mean or represent.
3650540	3656540	It just happens to be that when you crunch the numbers with all of these parameters in place,
3656540	3660540	you get the answer that you want, at least most of the time.
3660540	3662540	So that's essentially the intuition behind that.
3662540	3670540	And you can apply it to a very real world if mundane applications, given today's humidity, given today's pressure, yes or no should there be rainfall.
3670540	3674540	And maybe there is some mathematical function that based on years of training data,
3674540	3677540	we can infer what that prediction should be.
3677540	3683540	Another one, given this amount of advertising in this month, what should our sales be for that year?
3683540	3685540	Should they be up or should they be down?
3685540	3687540	Sorry for that particular month.
3687540	3700540	So real world problems map readily when you can break them down into inputs and a binary output often or some kind of output where you want the thing to figure out based on past data what its prediction should be.
3700540	3706540	So that brings us back to generative artificial intelligence, which isn't just about solving problems,
3706540	3716540	but really generating literally images, texts, even videos that again increasingly resemble what we humans might otherwise output ourselves.
3716540	3724540	And within the world of generative artificial intelligence, do we have, of course, the same images that we saw before, the same text that we saw before,
3724540	3730540	and more generally things like chat GPT, which are really examples of what we now call large language models,
3730540	3741540	these sort of massive neural networks that have so many inputs and so many neurons implemented in software that essentially represent all of the patterns that the software has discovered
3741540	3743540	by being fed massive amounts of input.
3743540	3747540	Think of it as like the entire textual content of the internet.
3747540	3752540	Think of it as the entire content of courses like CS50 that may very well be out there on the internet.
3752540	3765540	And even though these AIs, these large language models, haven't been told how to behave, they're really inferring from all of these examples for better or for worse how to make predictions.
3765540	3774540	So here, for instance, from 2017, just a few years back, is a seminal paper from Google that introduced what we now know as a transformer architecture.
3774540	3783540	And this introduced this idea of attention values, whereby they propose that given an English sentence, for instance, or really any human sentence, you try to assign numbers,
3783540	3790540	not unlike our past exercises, to each of the words, each of the inputs that speaks to its relationship with other words.
3790540	3795540	So if there's a high relationship between two words and a sentence, they would have high attention values.
3795540	3800540	And if maybe it's a preposition or an article like the or the like, maybe those attention values are lower.
3801540	3808540	And by encoding the world in that way, do we begin to detect patterns that allow us to predict things like words?
3808540	3809540	That is generate text.
3809540	3815540	So for instance, up until a few years ago, completing this sentence was actually pretty hard for a lot of AI.
3815540	3820540	So for instance here, Massachusetts is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.
3820540	3823540	It borders on the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
3823540	3826540	The state's capital is dot dot dot.
3826540	3828540	Now you should think that this is relatively straightforward.
3828540	3831540	It's like just handing you a softball type question.
3831540	3840540	But historically within the world of AI, this word state was so relatively far away from the proper noun that it's actually referring back to,
3840540	3846540	that we just didn't have computational models that sort of took in that holistic picture that frankly we humans are much better at.
3846540	3851540	If you would ask this question a little more quickly, a little more immediately, you might have gotten a better response.
3851540	3855540	But this is dare say why chatbots in the past have been so bad in the form of customer service and the like,
3855540	3861540	because they're not really taking all of the context into account that we humans might be inclined to provide.
3861540	3865540	What's going on underneath the hood without escalating things too quickly?
3865540	3870540	What an artificial intelligence nowadays, these large language models might do,
3870540	3876540	is sort of break down the user's input, your input, into chatupiti, into the individual words.
3876540	3880540	We might then take into account the order of those words.
3880540	3883540	Massachusetts is first, is, is last.
3883540	3887540	We might further encode each of those words using a standard way.
3887540	3891540	And there's different algorithms for this, but you come up with what are called embeddings.
3891540	3895540	That is to say, you can use one of those APIs I talked about earlier,
3895540	3902540	or even software running on your own computers to come up with a mathematical representation of the word Massachusetts.
3902540	3904540	And Rang Shin kindly did this for us last night.
3904540	3914540	This is the 1536 floating point values that open AI uses to represent the word Massachusetts.
3914540	3918540	And this is to say, and you should not understand anything you are looking at on the screen nor do I,
3918540	3924540	but this is now a mathematical representation of the input that can be compared against
3924540	3929540	the mathematical representations of other inputs in order to find proximity semantically.
3929540	3934540	Words that somehow have relationships or correlations with each other
3934540	3940540	that helps the AI ultimately predict what should the next word out of its mouth be, so to speak.
3940540	3944540	So in a case like this, these values represent, these lines represent all of those attention values
3944540	3948540	and thicker lines means there's more attention given from one word to another.
3948540	3950540	Thinner lines mean the opposite.
3950540	3956540	And those inputs are ultimately fed into a large neural network where you have inputs on the left,
3956540	3958540	outputs on the right.
3958540	3964540	And in this particular case, the hope is to get out a single word, which is the capital of Boston itself,
3964540	3970540	whereby somehow the neural network and the humans behind it at OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, or elsewhere
3970540	3974540	have sort of crunched so many numbers by training these models on so much data
3974540	3978540	that it figured out what all of those weights are, what the biases are,
3978540	3982540	so as to influence mathematically the output therefrom.
3983540	3989540	So that is all underneath the hood of what students now perceive as this adorable rubber duck,
3989540	3995540	but underneath it all is certainly a lot of domain knowledge and CS50 by nature
3995540	3997540	of being open courseware for the past many years.
3997540	4001540	CS50 is fortunate to actually be part of the model, as might be any other content
4001540	4005540	that's freely available online, and so that certainly helps benefit the answers
4005540	4008540	when it comes to asking CS50 specific questions.
4008540	4013540	That said, it's not perfect, and you might have heard of what are currently called hallucinations,
4013540	4019540	where chatGPT and similar tools just make stuff up, and it sounds very confident,
4019540	4023540	and you can sometimes call it on it, whereby you can say, no, that's not right,
4023540	4028540	and it will playfully apologize and say, oh, I'm sorry, but it made up some statement
4028540	4033540	because it was probabilistically something that could be said even if it's just not correct.
4033540	4038540	Now, I'll allow me to propose that this kind of problem is going to get less and less frequent,
4038540	4042540	and so as the models evolve and our techniques evolve, this will be less of an issue,
4042540	4046540	but I thought it would be fun to end on a note that a former colleague shared just the other day,
4046540	4052540	which was this old poem by Shel Silverstein, another something from our past childhood perhaps,
4052540	4056540	and this was from 1981, a poem called Homework Machine,
4056540	4060540	which is perhaps foretold where we are now in 2023.
4061540	4066540	The Homework Machine, oh, the Homework Machine, most perfect contraption that's ever been seen.
4066540	4069540	Just put in your homework, then drop in a dime, snap on the switch,
4069540	4075540	and in ten seconds time, your homework comes out quick and clean as can be.
4075540	4080540	Here it is, nine plus four, and the answer is three.
4080540	4081540	Three?
4081540	4082540	Oh, me.
4082540	4086540	I guess it's not as perfect as I thought it would be.
4086540	4089540	So, quite foretelling, sure.
4092540	4097540	Quite foretelling indeed, though for all this and more,
4097540	4102540	the family members in the audience are welcome to take CS50 yourself online at cs50.edex.org.
4102540	4109540	For all of today and so much more, allow me to thank Brian, Rung Shin, Sophie, Andrew, Patrick, Charlie, CS50's whole team.
4109540	4112540	If you are a family member here headed to lunch with CS50's team,
4112540	4116540	please look for Cameron holding a rubber duck above her head.
4116540	4118540	Thank you so much for joining us today.
4118540	4120540	This was CS50.
4142540	4144540	Thank you.
