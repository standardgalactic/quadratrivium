The text discusses the intersection between modern mathematical physics, particularly in the realm of quantum field theory (QFT), and traditional fields of mathematics. It highlights how quantum mathematical physics has led to new problems and insights that have influenced various areas of theoretical mathematics, including algebra, geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry.

Edward Witten, a physicist with a profound understanding of mathematics, is noted for his unique ability to translate physical ideas into mathematical formulations, often leading to significant mathematical discoveries. His work has had a profound impact on the field, often bridging gaps between physics and mathematics.

The key tool in this context is the Feynman integral, which is a powerful heuristic device used in QFT to solve problems that are otherwise highly complex. The Feynman integral involves an action functional, which is averaged over all possible fields defined on some manifold or space. These fields can represent various geometrical objects like connections, metrics, and so on.

The action functional itself is a sum of local terms, each involving differentials of the fields multiplied by coefficients (these are often called "propagators" in the physics literature). The result of the Feynman integral is a number that depends on the domain's boundary conditions or asymptotic behavior.

In quantum field theory, the action often comes from statistical mechanics or Hamiltonian dynamics, but in more general applications within quantum mathematical physics, it can describe more geometric objects relevant to different areas of physics, such as gravity.

Michael Atiyah cites the work of Witten on supersymmetry and Morse theory as an example of how the Feynman integral approach has led to purely mathematical theorems. In his paper, Witten showed how classical Morse inequalities could be proven using the language and methods of QFT, relating homology with Hodge harmonic forms and the Laplacian, which is akin to a Schrodinger operator in quantum mechanics.

In summary, modern mathematical physics, particularly through the lens of quantum field theory, has become a rich source of problems that stimulate new mathematical research. The Feynman integral is a central tool in this interdisciplinary endeavor, bridging the gap between physical phenomena and abstract mathematical concepts. Mathematicians like Edward Witten have demonstrated how the language of physics can be used to formulate and solve previously intractable mathematical problems.
