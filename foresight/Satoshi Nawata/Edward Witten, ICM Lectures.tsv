0	10800	Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege on this occasion to present Edward Whitten
10800	16320	for his plenary address, string theory, and geometry.
16320	23760	As you may have noticed, the program of this Congress, the Berkeley Mathematical Congress
23840	32320	of 1986, differs from its predecessors in the much greater emphasis given to the relationship
32320	39840	of mathematics to the sciences, both natural and artificial, to physics and to computer science.
40880	44960	This is true particularly of the plenary addresses, but also of the remainder of the
44960	51120	program. And it reflects in my view a profound change which has taken place in the
51360	59920	structure of mathematics at its cutting edge, what has been described by some of my equativeness
59920	67680	as a profound reconvergence of mathematics for the sciences. Edward Whitten epitomizes this
67680	73840	tendency in his sharpest form. By training in profession, he is a physicist, he is a professor
73840	80640	in the Department of Physics at Princeton, and by achievement, he is physicist at the highest
80720	88080	level, and a mathematician at the highest level. He has been one of the leading workers in recent
88080	94800	years in the ongoing development of string theory. He has been one of the, perhaps, the leader in
94800	101200	introducing ideas of conceptual originality and mathematical sophistication and that theory.
102080	110000	And he has also used those ideas in a very remarkable way to get important mathematical
110000	118480	results of a high degree of originality, both in concept and execution. In their lectures,
121040	124720	both Richard Schoen and Izzy Singer have referred to some of these results.
125520	133680	Another one to which they have not referred is his highly original proof of the Morse inequalities
133680	140560	using the eigenvalues of Laplacians on manifolds, the first original proof of that set of ideas
141280	148720	in 50 years. The material of which he is going to speak reflects one of the most powerful trends
148720	154320	in contemporary mathematics and the most powerful and sometimes controversial trend in theoretical
154320	160720	physics. The development of fundamental ideas concerning the unity of the theory of fundamental
160720	168400	particles and of gravitation in a highly sophisticated and elaborated mathematical form.
169440	176000	We welcome him here as a symbol of this movement, which will continue, I am sure,
176000	179760	in even sharper forms in the decades to come. Professor Whitten.

218160	221760	In 20th century physics, there have been two really basic ingredients,
222560	226640	which are first of all general relativity, which is Einstein's theory of gravity,
227360	232400	and secondly quantum field theory, which is the basic framework for our understanding of
232400	235040	essentially everything else in physics other than gravitation.
241680	245760	Though they both play a role in a description of the same natural world,
245760	248880	these two theories enjoy their successes in very different realms.
248880	258000	General relativity has its successes in the realm of astronomy, and quantum field theory
258000	263440	is the framework for successful descriptions of many aspects of the properties of atoms,
263440	277040	molecules, and subatomic particles. Most of the really important developments
277040	282000	in fundamental physics since about 1930 have been developments in quantum field theory,
282000	288240	or certainly in quantum mechanics, and for much of this time physics and mathematics
288240	292480	had relatively little interaction compared to that in many previous epochs.
296560	302480	One obvious reason for this perhaps is that in the 20th century mathematics advanced into
302480	308160	seemingly abstract realms unrelated perhaps it would seem to the humdrum world of the theoretical
308160	316000	physicist, but I think in large part the reason that the interaction of mathematics and physics
316000	321040	was more limited in the last half century than in previous epochs was because the physical
321040	325760	problems that arose in quantum field theory, which was the central framework for most
325760	330400	progress in physics, did not seem to give rise to many interesting mathematical structures.
332480	343360	By the mid-1970s this changed mainly because of developments in physics. By the mid-1970s
343360	348640	the quantum field theories which had emerged to play a central role in physics were the so-called
348640	353920	non-abillion gauge theories, theories in which one of the main ingredients is a vector bundle
353920	359200	over space-time with a non-abillion structure group. These theories raised more interesting
359200	366480	and significant issues in geometry and topology causing a more significant interaction of physics
366480	372880	and geometry starting about 10 years ago perhaps than had been possible during most of the epoch
372880	378880	in which quantum field theory played its central role in physics. In fact one of many strands leading
378880	385040	to Donaldson's work, which we heard about a couple of days ago, originated from this interaction
385040	396240	of physics and geometry. Now progress in quantum field theory led by perhaps a decade ago to the
396240	402160	beginning of an enriched interaction of physics and geometry, but I believe that all the same this
402160	407360	interaction would remain relatively limited if it were only a question of quantum field theory.
408240	413040	It's really in trying to go beyond the limits of quantum field theory that physicists have come
413040	423680	upon mathematical frontiers. Perhaps the fundamental limitation of quantum field theory
423680	428480	is the one I've already alluded to. It's only one of two fundamental theories in physics
428480	434000	and in fact quantum field theory turns out to be incompatible with that other basic ingredient in
434000	439840	20th century physics which is general relativity. You can attempt formally to combine these two
439840	444560	theories by so-called quantization of general relativity, but this leads to all kinds of
444560	455440	nonsensical formulas. Now in the early days of quantum field theory it was not at all obvious
455440	461520	that this was a central problem. Quantum field theory faced many problems in its early days.
461520	465440	It wasn't even obvious at the outset that the quantum theory of electricity,
465440	468640	quantum field theory of electricity, which was the original quantum field theory,
468640	474880	really made any sense. In time though the other difficulties of quantum field theory were overcome
475520	481440	and it became clear that quantum field theory was an adequate framework for describing all
481440	486160	of the forces of nature except gravity. Though in the course of learning how to do so,
486160	490800	physicists were led to develop quantum field theories with a richer geometrical contents,
490800	496400	such as the non-ability engaged theories I alluded to previously. As the other difficulties
496400	501680	of quantum field theory were overcome the incompatibility with general relativity emerged as
501680	512800	the limitation of this framework. Now general relativity is based of course on Riemannian
512800	520080	geometry which is certainly one of the richest frameworks for our understanding of ordinary
520080	526080	geometry and asserting that general relativity which is based on Riemannian geometry is incompatible
526080	532880	with quantum field theory. It must mean that some proper physical theory which will successfully
532880	538240	generalize general relativity and reconcile it with quantum field theory must in some way
538240	543040	be based on some generalization of Riemannian geometry compatible with the requirement of
543040	555120	quantum mechanics. Now experiments can only provide us with indirect clues about how we
555120	561440	should go beyond ordinary Riemannian geometry as a framework in physics and the reason for this is
561440	567200	that to our great regret gravitational effects are unmeasurably small in experiments that probe
567200	574480	quantum field theory and the same is true the other way around. There is actually only one example
574480	580080	in the previous history of physics in which a theory was invented even though the experimental
580160	585600	clues were only indirect. The one other success of that nature was general relativity itself
586400	592400	it was discovered in what we might call a logical way Einstein first beginning only with the very
592400	599360	general clue which was that special relativity was incompatible with gravity. Einstein first
599360	604320	formulated the physical ideas for reconciling two inconsistent theories then found the right
604320	609520	mathematical framework which was general Riemannian geometry and finally he invented the theory.
610400	618400	Now of course we'd like to emulate this history but that is easily said than done many ambitious
618400	623200	physicists and mathematicians have gone off into the wilderness in search of some fundamental
623200	628560	generalization of geometry that would reconcile gravity with quantum mechanics but generally
628560	644480	speaking they've come back empty handed if at all. While direct assaults on this problem have yielded
644480	651040	little progress seems to have fallen from the sky essentially through the largely chance discovery
651040	657200	of something called string theory. Now the people who invented string theory beginning in the late
657200	663520	1960s weren't aspiring to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics they weren't
663520	668880	hoping to generalize Riemannian geometry in fact the ambitions were not in the realm of our
668880	675920	discussion at all. String theory was originally developed as a theory of the so-called strong
675920	682800	interactions the nuclear forces that keep nuclei together despite the electric repulsion among
682800	691120	protons. Even as a theory of strong interactions string theory was discovered largely by accident
694160	698320	following its discovery which essentially occurred when one of the formulas in string
698320	705200	theory was written down by Veneziano with very slender motivation in 1968. Following the essentially
705200	710320	accidental discovery it was vigorously developed in this early period drawing which upwards of
710320	718000	500 papers were written led to an extremely rich mathematical structure which fascinated people
718000	723040	by its richness yet never advanced toward solving the original problem which motivated this work of
723040	728320	strong interactions and in fact this whole line of development was abruptly abandoned by most
728320	734960	physicists around 1974 when it became clear that it was not the correct approach to strong interactions.
735360	743600	While it was generally abandoned because of not being the solution of the original physical
743600	750560	problem the structure retained its fascination provoking work in various areas and eventually
750560	760320	being revived in the 1980s as an approach to quantum gravity. Now this subject has already
760320	765520	an extremely long and complex history and I fear that if I tried to survey even the high points of
765520	771600	this history it would take the rest of the lecture. I've written here some of the dates and
776080	781040	names of some of the main developments but it would be impractical to explain even a few of them
781040	788080	completely. I will be talking about some ingredients from some of these developments
788080	790080	but I'm not going to attempt to explain this history.
795920	801360	Now as I've indicated string theory essentially fell from the sky by chance
802080	806320	with some special formulas of this theory being discovered with a rather strange motivation
806880	810880	and it gradually being learned that these formulas were special cases of a richer structure
812080	817360	in which one has penetrated in times deeper levels but probably not very far toward the
817360	823440	deepest levels that underlie this theory. The situation in string theory is roughly as if
823440	828960	Romani and geometry had been sorry it's roughly as if general relativity had been invented without
828960	833280	having first invented the logical framework for this theory which is Romani and geometry.
834320	839840	Einstein happens to have followed Riemann but it's imaginable to have conceived of a planet
839840	846720	where the problem that Einstein posed of reconciling gravity with special relativity
846800	851600	would have existed on a planet where general relativity was unknown. Conceivably on such a
851600	857760	planet general relativity would somehow be invented in some obscure way without its logical
857760	864240	underpinnings Romani and geometry being clear. Whether or not that's happened on some planets
864240	868160	in the universe in which theoretical physics may have been developed it certainly has happened
868160	873760	on planet earth in the case of string theory. Because of the peculiar way that string theory
873760	878640	has been discovered I cannot do what I would dearly love to do and a lot of hope will be done
878640	883520	by some speaker at some future congress of the international congress of mathematicians
884960	890320	which is to explain the basic concepts of curvature connections and Romani and manifolds
890320	894640	which should play in string theory the role that Romani and geometry plays in general relativity.
897200	902560	I can try to explain some of what presumably are the preliminaries for this theory
903520	907200	and in sketching what I mean by these preliminaries perhaps I'll give you an
907200	913680	analogy with general relativity. In Romani and geometry one has some curved manifold
915920	923920	and if you consider at a point the tangent space to this curved manifold of course the
923920	929920	tangent space is a linear space and one thing you certainly have to be able to do in order
929920	935600	to work with Romani and geometry is to understand a little bit of elementary linear algebra
935600	942480	so that you can carry out linear operations in the tangent space. Roughly speaking our present
942480	947360	understanding of string theory was as if we were trapped in the tangent space of Romani and manifold
948080	953440	not understanding the basic frameworks that we would need the basic logical concepts that we
953440	958080	would need to go coherently beyond linear operations in the tangent space.
962800	969280	So the analog and string theory what the role which is played by linear algebra as a preliminary
969280	973920	to work in the tangent space of Romani and manifold that role the analogous role is played
973920	978240	in string theory by much richer mathematical structures which are the theory of Riemann
978240	984000	surfaces modular forms and what I will loosely describe as infinite dimensional representation
984000	989600	theory. Roughly speaking just as one needs a little linear algebra before trying to learn
989600	994080	Romani and geometry so one needs to know something about Riemann surfaces and infinite
994080	1000480	dimensional representation theory before trying to learn string theory. So we could say that
1000480	1009360	general relativity requires linear algebra for its linear approximation but the fundamental ideas
1009360	1015440	in the theory are really connections curvature and Romani and geometry. String theory requires
1015440	1020160	Riemann surfaces and infinite dimensional representation theory for its linear approximation
1021280	1027040	and what should really belong in the lower right hand corner of that square is I think to my thinking
1027120	1032000	and the thinking of many other physicists really the central problem in theoretical physics.
1040880	1046400	Now I've stressed the incompatibility of quantum field theory with gravity but in fact there are
1046400	1051520	certain other problems in our understanding of physics that we would like to overcome
1052160	1056400	and one of the most fundamental problems is simply that there are too many conceivable
1056400	1061120	theories permitted by the general principles that we have. Quantum field theory would permit
1061120	1066800	an infinity of theories and the logical framework of general relativity would also permit an
1066800	1072960	infinity of theories of which Einstein's is only the prototype. Of course if you try combining
1072960	1077200	these two frameworks you have not an infinity of theories but zero which is the assertion
1077200	1083040	that they're incompatible but if you could have combined quantum field theory with general
1083040	1087920	relativity with no particular difficulties then you actually would have had an infinity of possible
1087920	1093040	descriptions of the natural world which certainly would mean some basic gaps in your understanding.
1094160	1098480	So in a sense the blessing there might be a blessing in disguise in the difficulty of
1098480	1103920	reconciling these two frameworks either would separately permit an infinity of theories together
1103920	1109200	they seem to permit none and hopefully the proper understanding will lead to a finite set of theories
1109920	1116800	that reconcile them. To briefly illustrate what I mean in saying that the general ideas of
1116800	1123600	Romanian geometry would permit an infinity of theories the basic concept in general relativity
1123600	1130320	is really that spacetime which I'll call m is a pseudo-Romanian manifold it has a metric tensor g
1131200	1137760	and Riemann tensor the Ritchie scalar is what I've called r. Einstein's basic principle
1137760	1143280	was to describe nature by some geometrical action principle some geometrical integral
1143280	1148480	over spacetime was to be the action of this theory and while he wrote the simplest action
1149760	1155280	there are an infinity of more general action principles more general geometrical
1156320	1161840	invariance integrated over m that would give conceivable generalizations of general relativity
1161920	1168640	within the logical framework in some sense you might consider this to be the most
1168640	1173360	elementary member of the clan but when you consider another point which I'm about to
1173360	1180480	allude to presently in fact what has an infinity of theories without a evident most elementary example
1184080	1188880	so apart from the inconsistency of quantum field theory and general relativity we would
1188880	1194160	certainly like to overcome the fact that either of those separately leave us with too many theories
1194160	1201440	in fact with an infinity of conceivable theories to illustrate the other deficiency of general
1201440	1207840	relativity let me briefly discuss almost flat solutions of this theory of course in everyday
1207840	1214640	life we don't notice that spacetime is curved spacetime is flat in everyday life and of course you
1214640	1219120	can do a better job of probing for curvature if you measure over larger and larger scales
1219680	1225360	every romanian manifold is almost flat on a small scale gauss as many of you know measured the
1225360	1231760	angles between three high mountains and found pi as the sum confirming that one mount on the scale
1231760	1237360	of the alps spacetime is roughly flat and astronomers do much better on even larger scales
1238160	1245120	so we introduce as a good approximate description the flat metric eta the diagonal metric with these
1245120	1251440	eigenvalues we imagine a small deviation h from a flat metric we write the spacetime metric
1252640	1255040	as the min-count metric plus a small fluctuation
1258000	1262880	well if we insert this form of the metric in the Einstein equations we'll get a non-linear
1262880	1268560	equation but since spacetime is nearly flat let's linearize it if we linearize it we will get some
1268560	1275520	linear equation for h which will be some perturbation of the Laplace operator acting on h giving zero
1278480	1284320	well this equation has wave-like solutions the simplest being the plane wave I've written here
1284880	1290560	and these wave-like solutions are quite analogous to the corresponding wave-like solutions of Maxwell's
1290560	1297840	equations which are light waves so in this way we learned that general relativity permit predicts
1297840	1304080	gravitational waves a prediction of that theory which emerged clearly when the theory was formulated
1304080	1310480	in 1915 though it had been conjectured by Poincare some 10 years earlier and incidentally a prediction
1310480	1316640	which was finally tested indirectly by observations of radio waves from pulsars just a few years ago
1316640	1323040	now when this prediction was made it was a prediction of a new type of wave not a new
1323040	1330560	type of particle but in fact in quantum mechanics waves and particles are two facets of the same thing
1334880	1339440	so this prediction of a new kind of wave is actually a prediction of a new kind of particle
1339600	1346960	Einstein merely aspired to reconcile gravitational forces with special relativity
1347520	1352320	but in trying to do so he actually predicted a unified
1355280	1359680	not just a theory of gravitational forces but a unified theory of gravity and matter
1361040	1365760	gravitational forces were unified with this peculiar new kind of matter which was predicted
1365840	1371200	namely gravitational waves the Einstein wasn't satisfied with his unifications since he eventually
1371200	1376400	hoped to unify gravitational forces not with some exotic form of matter that he predicted but unknown
1376400	1381680	at the time but with the forms of matter that were known about so this is often described by
1381680	1386320	saying that Einstein didn't succeed in unifying gravity with matter but a better statement would
1386320	1391280	be to say that on a logical plane he unified gravitational forces with matter but wasn't
1391280	1394240	satisfied with the form of matter that the resulting theory predicted
1398640	1403760	so on a conceptual plane it's a great triumph that merely trying to describe gravitational
1403760	1409440	forces finding the logical framework which is romanian geometry writing down the simplest
1409440	1414240	equations in that framework which are nonlinear equations one then found that one had not merely
1414240	1420000	a theory of gravitational forces but a unified theory that unified gravitational forces with matter
1422240	1428320	however this wonderful unified theory has a couple of flaws it's incompatible with quantum field
1428320	1432880	theory that of course wasn't known at the time since quantum field theory was invented later
1433920	1438560	but evident even at the time was that the forms of matter predicted in this theory
1438560	1440240	were less rich than those that we observe
1441040	1456160	now I would next like to give a heuristic account of why string theory might what string theory is
1456160	1462960	and why it might be hoped to improve upon general relativity the framework for this really does
1462960	1468720	require some preliminaries about quantum field theory and I do hope to give a brief
1469440	1470960	comment about quantum field theory later
1474000	1478480	but without developing all the requisite preliminaries of quantum field theory
1478480	1484160	I would like to at least explain heuristically how one stumbles upon some generalization
1484160	1486480	of general relativity in the form of string theory
1490080	1494640	and in doing so I will be explaining conventional things in quantum field theory
1494640	1499360	in a way which is closely related essentially to the viewpoint introduced by poliakov some years
1499360	1510080	ago well in quantum field theory the scattering of particles such as the gravitons of general
1510080	1518560	relativity are described by Feynman diagrams now a Feynman diagram is a spacetime history of a
1518560	1530560	scattering process in this transparency I've sketched a scattering a spacetime history
1533040	1538160	time runs vertically on the diagram space or one of the space dimensions at least runs horizontally
1539520	1546240	particles have been emitted and absorbed at these points a b c and d the solid lines are actually
1546240	1553360	curves in spacetime along which a particle traveled and x y z and w denote points in
1553360	1558880	spacetime at which one particle split into two or in which two particles recombined into one
1562240	1565520	so this actually is a sketch of a sequence of events in spacetime
1569920	1574240	and if you start with some theory like general relativity
1574320	1576960	then the rules of quantum field theory will give you
1577920	1582400	algorithms for associating probabilities with spacetime history such as that one
1584240	1590720	actually you start with some abstract graph gamma and then you imagine some map of gamma
1590720	1596640	into spacetime which i'll call capital x x denotes a map of gamma into spacetime
1597760	1602160	of course this graph gamma is a collection of intervals if we map such an interval into
1602160	1608800	spacetime we can compute its arc length and the sums of those arc lengths is what i'll call i of x
1609360	1615040	the length of the image of this map graph gamma in spacetime under some map in which gamma is
1615040	1631600	mapped into x of gamma so let omega of gamma be the space of all maps of the graph gamma into
1631680	1638080	spacetime now in conventional quantum field theory of the last 50 years
1638800	1644160	even though this isn't quite the conventional way of describing the usual structures one almost
1644160	1650480	injured way to describe the usual thymine diagrams is as integrals over this path space omega of gamma
1652880	1657760	so we have an abstract graph gamma we map it into here i've sketched the image of that graph
1658320	1665200	such a map omega gamma is the base of all such maps i is the length of the image of the graph
1665200	1672960	under that map we try to integrate over omega of gamma e to the minus the length of the image of the
1672960	1679600	map times some facts i'll explain presently the local factors at the branch points in the graph
1679680	1687440	now one thing you'll note here is that infinite dimensional integral the integral over the
1687440	1692960	space omega of gamma of all conceivable maps of this graph into spacetime all conceivable
1692960	1699040	continuous maps of gamma into spacetime that's a characteristic infinite dimensional integral
1699040	1704240	that appears in prime and path integral formulations of quantum mechanics in quantum field theory
1705040	1714000	now one thing which we'll notice here is that when we're mapping this graph gamma into spacetime
1714880	1720000	gamma is not a manifold it's almost a one-dimensional manifold but actually it's a
1720000	1728000	one-dimensional manifold with singularities p q r and s and the ills of quantum field theory
1728000	1733200	all come about because gamma isn't a one-dimensional isn't a manifold but has singularities
1734240	1742720	we're taking this graph which is a one manifold with singularities we're mapping it into spacetime
1744240	1748080	and two bad things happen because of the fact that gamma isn't a manifold
1750720	1757120	first of all well we have to define this infinite dimensional integral and in fact
1758000	1764400	there is a there's a lot of experience and even some theorems in constructive field theory
1764400	1769600	about defining such infinite dimensional integrals and one thing we know about it
1769600	1774960	is that it will work a lot more nicely if you tried mapping a smooth one manifold into spacetime
1774960	1780240	rather than a graph with singularities when we map such a graph into spacetime we encounter
1780240	1786880	the possibility that the image of p q r and s in spacetime make coincide and in fact after
1786880	1791120	we've learned to define such infinite dimensional integrals in the first place we learned that
1791120	1798560	this integration is badly behaved near the region where x of p x of q up to x of s all coincide
1800320	1805840	this bad behavior makes all quantum field theories difficult to define but actually
1805840	1812000	impossible in the case of general relativity so our first problem in quantum field theory
1812880	1817680	its overall mathematical difficulty and in particular its incompatibility with gravity
1818240	1825600	arises because gamma isn't a manifold secondly because gamma isn't a manifold we have these
1825600	1833360	special points p q r and s and uh we had a nice simple factor in the integrand the exponential
1833360	1838400	of minus the area minus the length of the image of gamma in spacetime but since there are these
1838400	1846320	special points p q r and s it makes sense as those points are singled out to take some local
1846320	1854400	functional of the behavior of x near one of those points phi here is a local functional of x of p
1855120	1857200	and the derivatives of x near p
1860800	1867120	it makes sense to pick such a local functional and introduce a factor in the integrand at each of
1867120	1874640	those singular points p q r and s and in fact with certain very simple limitations each choice of
1874640	1880400	this local functional phi of p gives you a different quantum field theory the infinity of quantum
1880400	1885760	field theories corresponds to the infinity of local factors that can be introduced at those branch
1885760	1892560	points well of course you might think that we're straining things a bit and that there would be
1892560	1897920	a minimal model where we don't introduce these factors but one of the surprises perhaps is that
1897920	1903920	that isn't true if you take a nice geometrical theory like general relativity and yang mills theory
1903920	1908240	and transform it into this framework you'll definitely need some suitable local factors
1908240	1912960	at those points and on the contrary the theories that wouldn't have those local factors or would
1912960	1917120	have simple local factors turn out to be quantum field theories that don't have interesting
1917120	1923120	geometrical content so this is a freedom not only it exists in principle but we have to use it and
1923120	1933120	we do use it for the quantum field theories that are of most interest in physics so we have a variety
1933120	1939600	of problems which have their origin in the fact that gamma isn't a manifold suppose though that we
1939600	1948960	wish to ask an engineering shop let's say to make a physical model of the graph gamma well we probably
1948960	1954800	to find this graph as consisting of mathematical lines but the craftsman doesn't have mathematical
1954800	1958960	lines at his disposal so perhaps if we're lucky he uses thin tubes
1964240	1967840	and if he uses hollow tubes and joins them smoothly as a plumber does
1968560	1972800	then we can replace this graph by something for which it's more easy to make a physical model
1973360	1978320	which looks very similar from a big distance and that is actually why string theory if you'd
1978320	1984720	coarsely looks rather like quantum field theory but there's a fundamental difference in replacing
1984720	1991120	these mathematical lines with little tubes we've replaced the one manifold with singularity gamma
1991120	2004880	by the smooth remun surface sigma now in some sense in some sense the graph gamma
2004960	2010080	may be an approximation to sigma but the fundamental difference is that sigma is a smooth
2010080	2016480	manifold which gamma isn't and as a result in replacing gamma with sigma we will we in fact
2016480	2022160	overcome both the infinities in quantum field theory and also the lack of uniqueness the lack of
2022160	2027200	uniqueness came from the ability to attribute special factors with these points upon losing
2027200	2033600	those special points we in fact encounter a situation in string theory where we replace gamma
2033600	2044320	with sigma in which there are very few theories that can be formulated
2050240	2050320	now
2050720	2062720	the other main occurrence which arises when we replace gamma with sigma
2064080	2069600	let's take a close-up of this picture which I won't draw completely
2072080	2075440	remember this is actually a picture of a process occurring in spacetime
2076240	2083120	so time is running upwards in the picture and this graph gamma which I've drawn is actually
2083120	2089760	happening in spacetime it actually describes the propagation in spacetime of point particles
2089760	2094240	which for general relativity are the quantum counterparts of the waves that I sketched earlier
2095360	2097760	so I'm going to take a blow-up of a little piece of that picture
2098720	2109120	our blow-up is the propagation of a particle in time in spacetime if we take its locus at given
2109120	2116080	time we get a single point or at most a finite set of points the fact that we might get a finite
2116080	2120800	set of points instead of a single point leads to the fascinating story of creation of matter and
2120800	2126720	antimatter or perhaps it would take us too far afield to discuss it so I'll imagine that we find
2126720	2132560	the locus at a given time to be a single point and that corresponds to saying that this graph
2132560	2139120	is a theory of a point particle propagating in spacetime if in the same way we take the locus
2139120	2145120	at fixed time of one of these tubes it consists of a circle or perhaps a finite collection thereof
2146640	2152320	so we've actually replaced the point particle of field theory with
2152320	2161440	the oscillating circle you see I remarked that on a conceptual plane Einstein had unified
2161440	2165920	gravitational forces with some kind of matter but the matter in question wasn't rich enough
2166720	2171280	and it wasn't rich enough essentially because that point particle which was the locus of a
2171280	2177920	curve at given time didn't have enough freedom when we replace our graph with a Riemann surface
2177920	2183440	sigma the locus at given time isn't a point or finite collection of points but consists of
2183440	2188880	circles and one of those circles or in that case closed strings will be rather like a
2188880	2195360	violin string except without fixed endpoints physically it will oscillate in time and like
2195360	2199920	a violin string it will have an infinite set of harmonics which will correspond to different forms
2199920	2209200	of matter so in fact replacing gamma with the Riemann surface sigma means that one is dealing
2209200	2214560	with a theory with much richer forms of matter it's not at all obvious from what I've said that
2214560	2219440	these richer forms of matter will be at all like what we find in the real world but upon closer
2219440	2236240	investigation it turns out that they are so the seemingly innocent step of replacing gamma by sigma
2239120	2242560	leads us to a more unique theory with also a much richer form of matter
2242800	2249600	and it leads us at the same time into the world of Riemann surfaces and modular forms
2250480	2256240	and representation theory of certain infinite dimensionally algebras such as diff s1 the group
2256240	2268320	of difumorphisms of s1 which will act on this circle now I have another transparency which aims
2268320	2276080	at recapitulating what I've been saying so in a theory like general relativity we have really
2276080	2281520	basic formulas like the geometrical action principle the integral over spacetime of the
2281520	2287920	Ritchie scalar the beauty or lack of beauty of such a theory should be judged by the beauty of
2287920	2294960	its fundamental principles our aspiration would be to generalize this elegant action
2294960	2299280	geometrical action principle to some richer structure that will be compatible with quantum
2299280	2309440	field theory a direct and even indirect attempts to do so haven't been successful on the other hand
2310320	2317440	if we consider not the really fundamental formulas of Riemannian geometry but some drive formulas
2318480	2324000	such as the ones I've been discussing involving maps of graphs gamma into spacetime
2325520	2328720	then it turns out that some of the drive formulas can be generalized
2330800	2336480	now of course if at the top of everyone's mind was that we think of general relativity in terms
2336480	2340720	of maps of graphs into spacetime then this generalization would be more obvious and perhaps
2340720	2346240	would have happened sooner what makes it less obvious is that although this is closely related
2346240	2350880	to standard descriptions of what one gets from quantum field theory it's not the most standard
2350880	2357120	description by any means I haven't explained the steps in quantum field theory which lead from
2357920	2364080	fundamental formulas to less fundamental formulas involving these graphs it's possible to explain
2364080	2370640	it but would have taken an excessively long exposition if we work on this less refined plane
2370640	2376000	we find we can generalize the less fundamental formulas of quantum field theory getting something
2376000	2382880	called string theory which overcomes many of the difficulties for instance the lack of uniqueness
2382880	2388160	of quantum field theory which in this framework arose from the fact that the Ritchie scalar is
2388160	2393200	only one of many possible geometrical action principles in this less refined framework
2393200	2398640	is associated with the fact that gamma isn't a graph sorry gamma is a graph but not a manifold
2398640	2403360	and that is eliminated in going to Riemann surfaces and so on with other points I've already
2403360	2409600	illustrated so what has happened in the invention of string theory is that in a peculiar process
2409600	2415520	of trial and error with many historical stages one has succeeded in generalizing not the truly
2415520	2420960	fundamental formulas of older physical theories but some of the derived formulas
2424080	2425440	now just as
2426240	2433840	this picture with the graph gamma is to be derived from some much more fundamental viewpoints
2434400	2438560	the same ought to be true with our generalization of it involving Riemann surfaces
2439760	2444560	and elucidating what lies above the Riemann surface in the sense that general relativity
2444560	2450000	lies above these graphs is what I've alluded to as the mystery of unraveling the logical structure
2450000	2454240	behind string theory and I personally believe that it's a very fundamental problem for both
2454240	2462640	mathematics and physics one peculiarity is that ordinarily the beauty of a theory is to be judged
2462640	2468960	by its fundamental principles and not to be looked for in these derived formulas derived formulas
2468960	2474640	like the ones involving graphs and maps of graphs into spacetime are necessary tools if you want to
2474640	2479520	determine the quantitative predictions of a beautiful theory like general relativity but
2479520	2484080	they're not the basic formulas and they're not necessarily beautiful in fact they're ordinarily
2484080	2490880	not beautiful one of the surprises in string theory is that the Riemann surface generalization
2490880	2499040	of the theory of those graphs is very beautiful involves fascinating properties of Riemann surfaces
2499040	2505840	modular forms infinite dimensional representation theory algebraic geometry some of the many
2505840	2514960	beautiful aspects of this were described in a marvelous article by manin which was submitted
2514960	2519520	to this conference but which regrettably he wasn't able to deliver here because of not being allowed
2519520	2525600	to attend the conference but singer presented them very elegantly in a talk on tuesday afternoon
2527680	2532720	it comes one shouldn't expect beauty in trying to generalize a secondary formula
2532720	2537280	but actually in the case of string theory one finds that the generalization of this picture
2537280	2543360	with the graphs leads to very fascinating and beautiful mathematics and I personally would get
2543360	2548240	conjecture that what lies above here will in some sense stand in the same relation to general
2548240	2555760	relativity that the marvelous automorphic forms and algebraic geometry that enters in Riemann surfaces
2556320	2561600	uh path integrals Riemann surfaces compares to the Euler Feynman diagrams of field theory
2570160	2575840	now I haven't uh been able to explain how one goes from here to here that would be
2576480	2582160	rather too time-consuming I do want to use the remaining terms to the remaining time
2582160	2588240	to explain briefly a little bit of the flavor of what it means when we talk about the maps over
2588240	2593920	into infant dimensional spaces that are involved in dealing with these graphs gamma or the Riemann
2593920	2599760	surface sigma in their own terms so in the rest of this talk we're going to be working on this lower
2599760	2605200	half of the page without discussing how this one is associated with conventional field theory
2605920	2612880	now in doing this I will be giving a very brief uh introduction to quantum field theory
2614800	2621520	since I will have to attempt to extract one or two ideas in about 15 minutes
2626720	2633120	you see quantum field theory exists on the upper half of this page because
2633840	2638800	we started with quantum gravity or attempted quantum gravity in going here but quantum field
2638800	2643840	theory lives again at the lower half of this page because these infinite dimensional integrals
2643840	2650400	are really formulas in quantum field theory now quantum field theory has been for most of its
2650400	2658000	60 years almost the private preserver physicists and even now it has not yet emerged as a mathematical
2658000	2664800	tool but there are reasons to believe that quantum field theory might emerge as a mathematical tool
2664800	2670560	in the near future reasons independent of string theory for believing that because there are at
2670560	2674960	least two areas where progress in mathematics has come to the brink of quantum field theory
2675920	2679680	that is areas of mathematics where some characteristic features of quantum field
2679680	2685120	theory have begun to be recognized as significant one of these is the representation theory of
2685120	2690720	affine lee algebras which frankle reviewed yesterday and which is closely related to the
2690720	2695840	hamiltonian picture of certain quantum field theories and the other involves recent work in
2695840	2701120	arithmetic geometry which we will hear about in the next lecture where the derock determinant
2702000	2707120	which is one of the really fundamental characteristic ingredients in quantum field theory
2708080	2709680	has begun to play an important role
2710320	2720880	so in a choice of topics for an extremely brief comment on quantum field theory i'm going to
2720880	2726880	talk about points that are in string theory but might prove to be related in further developments
2726880	2733680	to the areas of mathematics i've just mentioned let then sigma be a Riemann surface perhaps with
2733680	2741840	boundary let phi taking sigma into the real numbers r be a real valued function and then let's define
2742960	2748240	an action very natural action which is called the action functional of free boson field theory
2748240	2755520	the integral over sigma of this two form del phi wedge del bar phi where del and del bar are the
2755760	2759920	del bar the natural operators associated with a complex structure on sigma
2767120	2773680	that f be a real valued function on the boundary of sigma and that omega sub f of sigma
2773680	2779280	be the space of real valued functions on sigma whose restriction to the boundary coincides with f
2779280	2788880	now we didn't need a Riemannian metric on sigma in defining the action i but if sigma
2788880	2795120	is endowed with a Riemannian metric and not just with a conformal structure then this affine space
2795120	2802240	omega f of sigma likewise has a natural metric which i've defined here by giving the distance
2802240	2808880	between two functions phi and phi prime now in finite dimensions a Riemannian metric certainly
2808880	2813360	induces a measure the so-called square root of the determinant if you wish to write it in formulas
2815600	2823040	and hoping that that works in infinite dimensions we might try to define what i call z sub f of sigma
2823600	2831360	which is the integral of e to the minus the action over the space of functions whose
2832480	2836400	restriction to the boundary coincides with f that's what i call it omega f of sigma
2837040	2842320	the integration measure is the one which we hope was induced by that Riemannian metric on sigma
2844640	2850320	well how are we going to integrate in infinite dimensions well physicists actually deal with
2850320	2854400	infinite dimensional integrals that are very difficult to define mathematically in which you
2854400	2859360	can't write explicit formulas but i happen for practice to have given you one for which we can
2859360	2865440	write an explicit formula i in this case was a quadratic functional of phi so we're integrating
2865440	2875120	the exponential of minus a quadratic functional that's a Gaussian integral and we know that
2875120	2880880	Gaussian integrals are integrals which are easy to evaluate in finite dimensions let a be a
2880880	2887520	quadratic form in finite dimensions if we're integrating in finite dimensions the exponential
2887520	2893040	of minus a quadratic form we can carry out that explicitly in terms of the square root of the
2893040	2901920	determinant of a or if we have a natural basis in phi so it makes sense to speak of eigenvalues
2901920	2909360	of a we can write the answer in terms of eigenvalues of a so we can try to interpret
2909360	2914880	Gaussian integrals in infinite dimensions in a similar way first consider the case where the
2914880	2921200	boundary of sigma is 0 the same action i wrote earlier can be written like so in a way that
2921200	2925600	makes the conformal invariance less obvious but some of the differential geometry more obvious
2925600	2932560	perhaps what the operator that appears here is the ordinary Laplacian
2936320	2942800	and delta plays the role of our quadratic form in finite dimensions so we should study the eigenvalue
2942800	2949360	problem delta phi equals lambda phi it's a nice eigenvalue problem a nice discrete set of eigenvalues
2950160	2956160	and formally we would like to define our integral as the product of the minus half powers of the
2956160	2963600	eigenvalues well of course this has a zero eigenvalue which we should throw away and it also is a
2963600	2973280	little bit divergent because of the infinite factor but nonetheless there are many natural ways of
2973280	2980640	regularizing this one elegant way of doing it is so-called zeta function regularization
2980640	2986320	we introduce the zeta function as sum over eigenvalues lambda to the minus s and then we
2986320	2990800	write a formula which would be correct in finite dimensions if this were finite sum
2991520	2996480	with an infinite set of eigenvalues the zeta function converges for a large enough real part
2996480	3002720	of s and we take here its analytic continuation to s equals zero this would be our zeta function
3002720	3007680	definition and there are many other definitions such as the polyvlar's method used in quantum
3007680	3020800	field theories some 40 years ago if now the boundary of sigma is not empty and we're given
3020800	3026640	a real valued function on the boundary we'd like more generally to define the integral not
3026640	3033440	over all maps of a segment of spacetime but only maps of segments are but only maps which coincide
3033440	3039600	with f on the boundary well for f equals zero what we've already said is quite adequate
3041600	3045200	for f equals zero we're still integrating a Gaussian integral on a linear space
3045840	3051200	we study the eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions that the eigenvalue vanishes on the
3051200	3054000	boundary and we make again the same definition
3065040	3070240	if f isn't zero then by classical theorems we find some unique there's a unique minimum
3070240	3074400	of this functional subject to the condition that the boundary value is equal to phi
3075760	3080640	let phi not be the extremizing function and that our integration variable phi be
3080640	3081920	phi not plus m correction
3090480	3095360	then we can easily work out by manipulations that would be valid in finite dimensions
3095360	3101520	the appropriate formulas it turns out in this case that the action because it's quadratic
3101520	3107840	for phi is the sum of the separate pieces and if phi has boundary value f then phi prime has
3107840	3114160	boundary value zero show shifting the integration variable from phi to phi prime we would work out
3114160	3129040	a formula now in reaching this point we've needed a metric on sigma we needed to claim that these
3129040	3137520	spaces um omega of sigma had had measures and we induced the measures from Riemannian
3137520	3144240	structures on sigma so since we need matrix on sigma to reach this point
3150960	3156160	these formulas are actually not conformally invariant if we make a conformal rescaling of
3156160	3162400	the metric of sigma which of course won't change its conformal structure as a Riemann surface then
3166480	3171040	this formula won't be invariant however it's possible to work out simple formulas
3171040	3176560	for how it transforms under conformal transformations to physicists those simple formulas involve the
3176560	3182880	so-called theory of anomalies and to mathematicians they involve the theory of the determinant line
3182880	3189920	bundle as it is entered in the work of faultings deline and the tn singer and more recently freed
3189920	3201920	in bismuth and others i've given a case um uh well more generally uh if one considers simple
3201920	3210160	generalizations of this one will be led to generalizations of these formulas whose behavior
3210240	3216160	under conformal rescalings of the metric involve a quite rich theory which involves the theory of
3216160	3221280	certain homomorphic line bundles over the modular space of Riemann surfaces in its mathematical
3221280	3226640	exposition but it wouldn't be practical to enter into that here i'll contend myself simply with
3226640	3237360	saying that i've tried to give a prototype of um some of the manipulations by which were led
3237360	3244720	to investigating determinants of operators such as the lapossian and for surfaces without boundary
3244720	3252400	such that we wouldn't have that factor here this is a simpler prototype of some of the things they
3252400	3265600	enter in the next lecture now i'd like to conclude by uh returning to our more general themes
3268160	3272320	i suppose it would be plausible to conjecture that in some suitable sense
3272320	3275520	the number of really fundamental problems in mathematics is infinite
3277360	3281120	but i personally believe that the number of really fundamental physics problems is finite
3282080	3286160	and therefore by definition a physicist who has the privilege of working on such problems is lucky
3287520	3293680	since in the course of time progress will slow either by solving them or by failing to make
3293680	3300160	further progress if it's true that the number of really fundamental physics problems is finite
3301200	3305280	then the number of episodes in the future in which there will be really fundamental
3305280	3311200	interaction of mathematics and physics will likewise be finite however there are reasons
3311200	3324720	for believing that the next few decades will be one of those epics
3324720	3336240	so
3340160	3349440	so let us begin informal seminar on which professor witten will speak on gage theories and
3349440	3356480	john's polynomials uh professor witten's work was already introduced to you in the first day
3356480	3362480	so he need no more introduction so i give floor to professor witten please thank you
3370160	3375280	i'm very glad this is an informal talk as a result of which my wife hasn't required me to wear a suit
3375680	3379680	so i will be describing
3383520	3388000	a particular three-dimensional quantum gauge theory which
3390080	3397360	puts the john's polynomial and it's in a manifestly three-dimensional form exhibiting
3397360	3406720	its symmetries which are not obvious from the original definitions and also although i won't
3406720	3413360	have a chance to talk about this exhibits its formal analogies to modular moonshine that is
3413360	3419520	moonshine in the theory of the monster group and the theory of our finely algebras modular invariance
3419520	3427520	in those theories a donaldson theory and other things and also gives a context in which the quantum
3427520	3436400	group uh quantization of an ordinary league group arises from ordinary geometry for special gauge
3436400	3441760	groups this theory is also related to some other things including three-dimensional quantum gravity
3441760	3446880	the castan invariant and some of the fashionable models of high temperature superconductivity
3446880	3458640	so i thought that uh well i'd begin the talk with a little bit of the end just uh as an
3458640	3465120	inducement so remember that on the first day in explaining von jones's work
3465920	3473040	john burman explains a bit about skein theory and also indicated the history of the skein theory idea
3473040	3479600	that i'm about to summarize and the people who contributed to it so this is a very pretty picture
3479600	3486160	where you have three pieces of knots these pictures are meant as pieces of very complicated
3486160	3491120	knots which i won't draw but you have some complicated knot and inside the dotted line it
3491120	3497440	just looks like this this or this and you consider three knots which are the same outside the dotted
3497440	3503200	lines of some projection but inside a little sphere which has been projected onto the plane
3504240	3509680	you have these three different pictures and you have three complex numbers alpha beta and gamma
3509680	3517360	and you define an invariant of a knot by saying that the invariance of three pictures that are
3517360	3524000	the same outside and look like this inside weighted by complex numbers alpha beta and gamma add up to
3524000	3531680	zero by an elementary induction it can be seen that this property uniquely defines a knot invariant
3531680	3537680	if it exists but the fact that it does exist is considerably deeper and in a way is this part
3537680	3543920	of the surprise of the jones polynomial and its generalizations the humphly and patricki
3544560	3551600	tragic and colvin polynomials and others now the explanation we will get for this beautiful picture
3551600	3558240	is as follows you see the boundary of this sphere has four mark points where the knots pass through
3558240	3564800	the sphere and we will find a natural way to associate a two-dimensional vector space which
3564800	3572080	i call h sub s to every sphere s with four mark points it's a two-dimensional vector space and
3572080	3579680	that's why there are three terms in this scan relation the association of the vector space to
3579680	3587600	every sphere has the property that every bordism determines a vector in this space now by a bordism
3587600	3594720	i mean a three manifold which has for boundary this sphere and in which the mark points are
3594720	3601120	boundaries of bits of knots the knot these lines are only permitted to end at those four points
3602000	3608240	so this picture here we had the same boundary in the three cases but the interiors are three
3608240	3617760	different bordisms and in this theory every bordism determines a vector in h sub s
3619520	3625120	and we will have in this theory a knot invariant in which the details of the interior of s don't
3625120	3634320	matter all that matters from the mess that might be inside s is this vector size of b in the
3634320	3642640	Hilbert space on the boundary now a simple fact of linear algebra is that any three vectors in a
3642640	3649680	two-dimensional space obey a linear relation alpha psi one plus beta psi two plus gamma psi three is
3649680	3655760	zero for some complex numbers alpha beta and gamma in this case we make the three vectors
3655760	3663840	determined by these three bordisms and they base on linear relation and if you glue them into some
3663840	3669680	more complicated picture so that these are little pieces of knots which are constant outside this
3669680	3676240	sphere and look like this inside then this relation is a relation between the values of the invariant
3676240	3683600	for three different knots so the existence of this theory now the characteristic of the theory
3683600	3688560	will be the values of alpha beta and gamma and such a theory predicts the validity of scheme
3688560	3693280	theory that is the ability to define a knot invariant this way for a particular value of
3693280	3699520	alpha beta and gamma to explain scheme theory in general we need a two-parameter family of
3699520	3703760	such constructions so that the ratios of alpha beta and gamma are variable
3708240	3713200	so that's the answer we will eventually get although perhaps not completely explained today
3713200	3719200	for the validity of scheme theory it comes fundamentally from the existence of a knot invariant
3719760	3727520	which can be computed well where the details of what's inside any little sphere don't matter
3727520	3733680	all that matters is the vector that that bordism determines in the two-dimensional vector space
3733680	3739120	now put this way
3743040	3750400	it's an elementary topological idea but its geometrical realization will bring us into
3750400	3754960	matters that may seem either far afield at first sight in the realm of quantum field theory
3756640	3760160	while we will be doing quantum gauge theory so we pick a gauge group g
3761120	3766640	g is a v group which for economy of exposition we take to be connected and simply connected
3768720	3773760	this simplifies the it's not essential but it simplifies the discussion because then every g
3773760	3780560	bundle on a three-man hold is trivial we don't necessarily assume that g is compact although
3780560	3786960	we will sometimes assume it again for simplicity only we assume that g is simple in that case
3787600	3792240	up to a scalar multiple there is a unique invariant quadratic form on the le algebra of g
3793360	3798560	and we denote it as the trace we denote the pairing of two elements as the trace of their product
3799680	3804240	the motivation being that it can actually be realized as the trace in some representation
3805440	3810720	and the normalization I'll give in a second is such that for SUM this scalar product is the
3810720	3822960	trace in the n-dimensional representation now a g bundle e on a four-man hold x has a characteristic
3822960	3830960	number which can be computed by taking the curvature of any connection and integrating trace of f
3830960	3838000	wedge f and our normalization of the trace is such that this is integer valued
3840720	3847680	so that's an in a topological invariant or in a four-man hold the corresponding secondary
3847680	3854000	turn simons invariant isn't a topological invariant but is in an invariant that depends on a connection
3854800	3862880	if we have a three-man fold m and a g bundle over it and a connection on that bundle then
3862880	3869440	there is a corresponding secondary invariant so the bundle is called e we extend the the bundle
3869440	3877840	on the connection over some four-man hold b and we define the three the three-dimensional secondary
3877840	3885040	invariant is the integral over the bounding four manifold of the object which on a closed four
3885040	3892800	manifold would have two pi times integer periods the fact that for closed manifolds the periods are
3892800	3899440	two pi times integers means that for a manifold of fixed boundary this depends on the extension only
3899440	3904800	up to a multiple of two pi integral multiple of two pi so this is well defined with values in
3905600	3911360	real numbers modulo two pi times integers or in other words it's exponential times the square root
3911360	3922240	of minus one has is well defined with values in u one now we're going to be studying a certain
3922240	3929280	quantum gauge theory in which the Lagrangian is a positive integer k times this functional i of a
3930240	3939200	and this integer k is related as it turns out to the level in the theory of affine leochvus
3944000	3950160	now as is standard in quantum field theory the discussion has two halves one is the construction
3950160	3955280	of Hilbert spaces and in this case they will be generalizations of the jones representations of
3955280	3961840	the break group and the second part are path integrals although it's hard to explain this
3961840	3967680	just in one lecture the questions we will ask and the methods we use are not dreamed up on a
3967680	3972720	not hope basis for this particular problem there are the techniques of quantum field theory adapted
3972720	3978000	to this situation albeit a somewhat unusual situation in which some steps that are usually
3978080	3987040	relatively trivial become non-trivial now the goal of the first step of the discussion
3987760	3993920	is to associate a Hilbert space h to every two manifold sigma every closed Riemann surface
3993920	4000720	sigma and this is accomplished in general in quantum field theory this is a comp so we're in
4000720	4006000	three dimensions but in the Hamiltonian version we are in one dimension less here two dimensions
4006000	4010400	we consider manifolds without boundary and for every such we wish to find a Hilbert space
4010960	4016800	and this Hilbert space is constructed by quantizing a suitable suitable syntactic
4016800	4022480	manifold which in general is the modular space of critical points of the Lagrangian
4022480	4027840	on a particular three manifold which is the surface times R1 that being time
4028800	4036560	now floor discussed the same functional in another context and as he explained a critical
4036560	4042400	point of this functional is a fault connection or in other words a representation of the fundamental
4042400	4053520	group of m into g now since pi1 of m is the same as pi1 of sigma the modular space of such
4053520	4059520	representations is the same as the modular space of fault connections on sigma and this is the
4059520	4068240	space we will quantize now this space is often studied by people studying Riemann surfaces
4068240	4073200	but here in principle it's arising as a representation space of a certain three manifold
4073200	4077600	that happens that that degenerates to representations of the fundamental group of
4077600	4084480	sigma because m is contractable to sigma but in principle this space is originating with a
4084480	4090240	three-dimensional origin which is the beginnings in a very elementary level of the three-dimensional
4090240	4097040	explanation of the Jones polynomial now as a preliminary which is usually trivial in quantum
4097040	4102640	theory but here non-trivial we have to consider what kind of object is the Lagrangian on a three
4102640	4108880	manifold with boundary and here I will be explaining what constant and serial call
4108880	4113680	pre quantization in this context but I'll be explaining it in some detail when we actually
4113680	4121120	get to quantization I won't go into such detail so remember how we defined the action functional
4121120	4127120	we had a three manifold with that boundary then we regarded it as the boundary of some
4127120	4135520	poor manifold b and the action was defined as an integral over b so implicit in this is that
4135520	4142000	the boundary of m was zero so that m was the boundary of some b now we want to let the boundary
4142000	4148960	of m be non-zero and this definition therefore doesn't make sense and therefore we don't have any
4148960	4155040	we in fact no no longer have this turn simons functional as an r mod 2 pi z valued functional
4155760	4163520	however what is the nature of the obstruction that a curly a will be the space of connections
4163520	4171200	on the surface sigma then we can't define this exponential of the turn simons function as a
4171200	4177200	number but we will define it as a section of a line bundle over the space of connections
4177200	4184080	or more precisely a connection on the three manifold has boundary values in a and for every
4184640	4191040	point in a we have a one-dimensional complex vector space the fiber of a line bundle at that
4191040	4196880	point and this thing will not be a number but will take values in the fiber of that line bundle
4198640	4204800	so the line bundle is really defined just by asking what's the obstruction to defining this
4204800	4209760	as a number while the obstruction was that we had an open three manifold and if we knew how to
4209760	4216560	close it we could get a number again so we just exploit that systematically we have this space of
4216560	4222320	connections to describe a line bundle over the space of connections we must for every point in
4222320	4228080	that line in that space describe a one-dimensional complex vector space visa bay and we declare
4228080	4234480	that visa bay has a basis which we call a prime for every extension of a over any three manifold z
4235440	4240640	z is any three manifold and a prime is any extension of the connection over z
4241360	4247520	actually we also extended the bundle and connection over z and for every such extension
4247520	4255280	this line has a basis a prime well i need to tell you how to compare two different basis elements
4255920	4260240	and i can do this because if a prime and a double prime are too such extensions
4261040	4266000	individually they don't have a churn simons invariant but they have a relative churn simons
4266000	4271360	invariant because they have the same boundary by definition so if i glue them together with
4271360	4277600	opposite orientation we get a closed three manifold and then the connection on the closed
4277600	4283760	three manifold has a number a complex number valued invariant and we just say that a prime is a
4283760	4291760	double prime times this number so now although we have no natural basis in this one-dimensional
4291760	4297600	vector space we've defined a one-dimensional vector space for every connection on the surface
4298720	4305040	and thus as the connection on the surface values and varies in the space of all such connections
4305040	4308560	we got a line bundle l over the space of connections on sigma
4308560	4317600	now this line bundle has an actual unitary connection in fact if we're given a path in
4317600	4324160	the space of connections so a1 and a2 are connections on sigma on the surface sigma
4324160	4330400	and gamma is a path between them in the space of connections that path gives us a connection
4330400	4335040	on a certain three manifold the three manifold is sigma times the unit interval
4335920	4341360	and one sigma times the unit interval we take the connection which is trivial in the in this
4341360	4348640	direction in which in this direction is a1 at this end and a2 at this end and interpolates
4348640	4355120	between them by the given path so that's a connection on a particular three manifold
4356640	4362560	and now if you tell me and how to extend a1 over some three manifold then i know how to
4362560	4369840	extend a2 over some three manifold because the interpolation from a1 to a2 which we just discussed
4369840	4375520	can be glued on to your interpolation and that gives a unitary connection on this line bundle
4377520	4382960	in other words if you give me a trivialization of the fiber at a1 i've given you a trivialization
4382960	4390320	of the fiber at a2 which depends on this path and we interpret that as parallel transport
4390320	4393760	of the trivialization here to a trivialization here along that path
4398480	4404000	now let g hat be the gauge group of maps of this surface into g
4405600	4410800	then g hat acts on the space of connection along sigma and with a small effort that
4410800	4416080	actually requires a slight elaboration of what i've said the g hat action lifts to an action on
4416080	4422960	this line bundle preserving the connection now we have a projection from the space of connections
4422960	4428480	through connections modular gauge transformations we can ask whether the line bundle with connection
4428480	4435360	descend and they don't the standard criteria are in debate if you take a little loop downstairs
4435360	4440880	and lift it to a loop upstairs the polynomial on the loop will depend on the left and therefore
4440880	4447120	there's no way to make these things descend but if we restrict ourselves to five connections
4447840	4453280	the space of five connections on sigma then by elementary considerations you see that this
4453280	4460000	line bundle and connection do descend to a line bundle and connection over the space of
4460000	4466560	five connections divided by gauge transformations and that was the modular space of five connections
4467360	4472160	on this surface which i indicated earlier was going to enter
4474320	4479840	so we get a line bundle with connection over the space of five connections on sigma
4480560	4486080	its curvature can be computed in an elementary fashion and is the standard symplectic structure
4487840	4491760	which was first provided to gauge theories by a tia and bat in a paper that caranel and
4491760	4498800	back mentions is the standard symplectic structure on this manifold now these things
4500320	4505840	have been studied in the past in other methods and in particular this line bundle and connection
4506800	4512000	in special cases are usually constructed by picking a complex structure on sigma
4512000	4517440	and using algebraic geometry if you pick a complex structure on sigma so that sigma is
4517440	4524240	a complex Riemann surface then by the Narasimhan-Sashadri theorem this modular space is a modular
4524240	4530720	space of holomorphic bundles on sigma and then one has the determinant line bundle with its
4530720	4537360	racing or quillen metric and its curvature as computed by quillen is precisely the same
4538720	4546560	curvature as this thing so there's a holomorphic construction in special cases like the unitary
4546560	4553200	group or for any group for special values of k there's a holomorphic construction of this line
4553200	4560160	bundle that depends on picking a complex structure on sigma what we've achieved by the
4563840	4570400	construction I've given is that we've given a purely topological construction it doesn't
4570400	4576320	depend on any complex structure the mapping class group acts in a fashion which is visible
4577680	4585200	essentially and at the same time we've related the construction to three manifolds what we've
4585200	4590960	achieved is actually what constant and surya called pre quantization in this problem we've
4590960	4595760	constructed what is called the pre quantum line bundle and we've constructed it in a way that
4595760	4601200	doesn't break this topological invariance of the problem and you see the construction was naturally
4601200	4605040	related to thinking of it in relation to three manifolds which is what we want because we want
4605040	4614240	to do a three-dimensional problem now going back to the original question I raised of what is the
4614240	4620960	term simons and variant i of a if a is a connection on a three manifold with boundary well we see that
4620960	4627520	total logically it makes sense as a suction of this line bundle that we introduced or more
4627520	4633600	exactly a vector in the appropriate fiber of that line bundle because any trivialization of the line
4633600	4641440	bundle which is an extension a bounding three manifold an extension of the connection enables
4641440	4654480	us to make sense of that thing as a number so this is pre quantization in this situation
4657040	4663200	now not only have we pre quantized that is we've constructed the appropriate line bundle over the
4663200	4670800	right module space which has the right unitary connection and the right curvature and without
4670800	4675760	breaking any of the symmetries of the problem but we're in a very good situation because this
4675760	4682000	modular space is the sympathetic quotient of an affine space the affine space is the space of
4682000	4687120	connections and you see we took two steps we restricted to five connections and we divided
4687120	4694000	by the gauge group and although i won't explain it those compound steps are mathematicians call
4694000	4700560	them the sympathetic quotient and for physicists they go back to newtons use of symmetries to
4700560	4708320	reduce a problem in mechanics but anyway this rather complicated modular space of fault connections
4708320	4715280	we're seeing it in relation to an affine space a with a group action and this relation of course
4715360	4725040	between the two is what was exploited by atea and bat to compute the chronology of this modular space
4727920	4732960	but here we're seeing the same we will be using the same relation in a different way
4732960	4735360	that's appropriate to this particular quantum field theory
4737760	4743360	now we want to quantize and i won't have time to explain quantization in as much detail as i
4743360	4752320	gave for pre quantization but quantization means associating a helbert space h which should be
4752320	4757360	canonically associated with the data and the data are a modular space and the loin bundle with
4757360	4763280	connection but these data were canonically determined by the surface sigma as we saw
4764160	4769600	so we will really be canonically associating a helbert space with the surface signal
4769600	4778480	now what quantization means in general is a long story but if there were a natural
4778480	4786640	complex structure j on this mod space m obeying certain conditions most importantly that the
4786640	4792000	symplectic structure the curve the curvature of this connection should be of type one one
4792000	4795040	so that the line bundle will get a natural homomorphic structure
4795600	4801120	and in addition the symplectic structure should be positive relative to that complex structure
4802480	4808400	if there were an actual complex structure then the quantum helbert space would be you see
4811200	4816560	if we had such a complex structure then our modular space we take as a complex manifold
4817200	4823680	and the conditions mean that the loin bundle is a homomorphic loin bundle and at level k
4823760	4828320	we will take the kth power of that loin bundle and take its homomorphic sections
4828320	4832560	and that would be our helbert space for the level k theory with this gauge group
4833280	4835040	and associated with this surface sigma
4837760	4843760	while there isn't a natural complex structure on m but for every choice of complex structure
4844320	4850720	on this underlying surface sigma we have a hodge decomposition of cohomology you see the tangent
4850720	4857440	space for this modular space is the Durand cohomology of sigma with values in a twisted bundle
4857440	4863280	and if we complexify it then it has a hodge decomposition and that hodge decomposition
4865200	4870080	is really then a complex structure on this modular space in fact it's precisely the
4870080	4875440	complex structure predicted by the Narasimha and Sashadri theorem and I will call it by the
4875440	4882640	same name j so for every complex structure j on the surface we get a complex structure j
4883440	4888240	on this modular space and thus by the definition on the last transparency
4890560	4895840	for every complex structure j we can make this definition but if j is not natural then neither
4895840	4904000	is curly h so we have a definition of curly h but it depended on j so I'll call it curly h sub j
4905440	4913200	and because of the j dependence well this situation to begin with is fibrous over the
4913200	4918960	space of all complex structures on sigma but it trivially reduces to the space of complex
4918960	4925040	structures up to isotope or in other words to take more space so we really have a situation
4925040	4931280	that's fibrous over take more space we'll have this family of hybrid spaces fibrous over take more
4931280	4941680	space actually without mentioning it I started to assume a transparency or two ago that this
4944320	4950880	well I didn't prove that the hodge decomposition gave a complex structure that really at that
4950880	4957520	point was assuming the case of a compact group for other classively groups we'd get something but
4957520	4961760	not quite this so we're now assuming for the moment that we're dealing with a compact group
4963280	4968480	now we wanted a single helbert space and we have a family of them and of course to get back to the
4968480	4973760	situation of a single helbert space what we wanted is a natural flat connection on this bundle
4975680	4980960	such a flat connection since the base take more space is contractible such a flat connection
4980960	4986080	would give us a natural identification of the fibers such a connection can be explicitly and
4986080	4993280	rigorously constructed as I did along these lines with axolot and telepiedra using two facts
4995040	5002000	the first fact is that if we were quantizing an affine space such a fat connection exists
5002000	5006000	because of the stone von Neumann theorem on the unique representation of the
5006000	5011760	Heisenberg group and physicists think of this fat connection as the infinitesimal generator of
5011760	5018320	what we call bugolubov transformations and then one can push down from an affine space to a
5018320	5025360	synthetic portion by restricting to the G invariant subspace now for finite dimensional affine
5025360	5032160	spaces these two facts will give the result a priori here the affine space is infinite dimensional
5032160	5037760	only the synthetic portion is finite dimensional so what one has to do is to take the formulas
5037760	5044560	which would be valid a priori in the finite dimensional case and do a little bit of geometry
5044560	5049680	to verify them and in fact modify them slightly so that they make sense in this case for only
5049680	5057360	downstairs you have a finite dimensional story now the fault connection one gets this way
5058320	5061680	or I've written it in the plural because there were different groups and levels
5062400	5069680	these fact actions since the mapping class group acts here one really gets representations of the
5069680	5078160	mapping class group and as was first perceived by Tsuchiya and Kanya in a work that was part of
5078160	5083920	what made possible the soil development these are generalizations of the Jones representations
5083920	5090240	of the braid group to get precisely the Jones representations you would take sigma the surface
5090320	5095200	to have Gina zero and you would have to include knots and mark points in a way that I haven't
5095200	5102480	indicated moreover the equations that define this fact connection are the generalizations to
5102480	5107760	genus G of the Keynesian exam logic of equation which we've heard so much about in so many different
5107760	5117040	talks at this congress starting with Jim Bo's talk explaining part of the work of Jim Fed and
5117040	5122560	including unexpected applications to number theory that were mentioned in one of the primary
5122560	5130480	addresses yesterday now this construction of this particular file connection for compound G
5130480	5137280	has been obtained in other ways where the original results came from conformal field theory about
5137280	5142400	six years ago by Konishnik and Samochikov and Gina zero and Aguchi and Ugari some years later
5142400	5150560	at genus one and these authors were studying the well what's sometimes called the West
5150560	5157920	Amino Novikov-Witton model of conformal field theory and then these constructions were formatted
5157920	5163120	rigorously at an arbitrary genus by Tsuchiya at all Tsuchiya talked about it yesterday
5163760	5171120	and there was a simple argument well this a simple sketch of an argument by Siegel in the
5171200	5178880	Swansea proceedings from two years ago also it's possible to construct this connection by pure
5178880	5183200	algebraic geometry and this has been done by Hitchin and by Balanson and Karzhan
5188880	5190480	the construction I've indicated
5195040	5200720	is natural in relation to three dimensions in the sense that it's the one that arises naturally
5200720	5206720	as the solution to a quantization of this pre-quantized symplectic manifold and
5207920	5213360	it extends to other classes of gauge group which we hope is may also be the case for some of the
5213360	5218400	other approaches ultimately in fact with some minor modifications relatively minor modifications
5218400	5223920	of what I've said it's possible to carry out a similar construction if G is a complex semi-simple
5223920	5233680	e-group now perhaps I'll devote one transparency to a site digression so far there are no results
5233680	5239520	about this problem for other classes of e-group which were like to study and notably for non-compact
5239520	5246800	real forms even in the simple case of SL2R now in a very precise sense which would take us far
5246800	5252240	field to really explain this subject is a generalization of representation theory and from that
5252240	5256640	point of view the facts I've stated aren't too surprising so in representation you know well
5256640	5262160	that compact groups are the easiest followed by compact scripts and that the non-compact
5262160	5266800	real forms are an order of magnitude harder and difficult to study in a unified fashion
5267440	5272400	so I've told you that again in this context I had a transparency alluding to different
5272400	5279520	approaches for the compact groups and the corresponding problem for the complex groups
5279520	5286800	is definitely harder and is much less well understood but it is tractable it's the next
5286800	5292000	case after the compact groups it leads of course to infinite dimensional helbert spaces just as
5292000	5296320	in representation theory where the unitary representations are infinite dimensional
5297760	5302560	and the solution of this problem for complex groups is related to compact groups
5302560	5308160	much as in the case of representation theory since there are no results for the non-compact
5308160	5312880	real forms one doesn't know what will happen but either there's some reasonable way to solve
5312880	5317600	this problem which might well lead to some new viewpoint in representation theory or this problem
5317600	5323200	might be affected with more elaborate versions of the usual difficulties in representation theory
5329840	5335760	well we now come to the deeper part of the story and while I wish to emphasize that what I've said
5335760	5343520	up until this point is very precise mathematically in proceeding we will have to base ourselves
5343520	5347440	for a while on the massive experience in theoretical physics in the last 40 years
5348320	5351360	but at the very end we will get back to the realm of
5352000	5357760	precise rigorous mathematics as of our period so
5358720	5366480	I might say as a general role I'm explaining a particular quantum field theory and in this
5366480	5371280	particular quantum field theory the deeper results are based on the ideas that I will indicate
5371840	5375200	but that's there's a similar statement that can be made about
5379280	5383760	other quantum field theories of geometrical interest for instance if one is interested in
5384720	5389600	what was called by Conway and Calbert as monster moonshine in the theory of the monster
5389600	5394160	simple e-group the quantum field theory explanation for it is based on the same
5394160	5398880	Feynman-Pathens a goal that I'm about to tell you about together with the conformal field theory
5398880	5405920	constructed by Frank Lepasky and Merman so in general I'm about to tell you the aspect which
5405920	5417440	Fadeev stressed in his lecture on the opening day the aspect of quantum field theory ideas
5417440	5422400	which is perhaps most indigestible mathematically but which usually leads to the deepest results
5424880	5431040	so the heuristic motivation for this well we've made an association of Hilbert's bases with
5431040	5437600	surfaces by picking a gauge group on a level k and quantizing and this association is somewhat
5437600	5443600	analogous to the association of a surface with its let's say complex cohomology first cohomology
5443600	5450320	in each case a diffeomorphism of surfaces induces some map on these spaces
5452320	5458720	and in the case of cohomology if you pick a bound in three manifold that actually determines
5458720	5465200	a Lagrangian subspace in the first cohomology group namely the subspace of things that extend
5466560	5472640	over the three manifold and you may ask whether there's some analog here
5473920	5478960	a surface is sitting there with its first with its h1 but if you give a three manifold
5478960	5484320	suddenly that determines a subspace a preferred subspace of h1 you can ask what's the analog here
5485280	5493440	and now just for fun let's guess what it might be of course I'll make a slightly biased guess
5494320	5501920	if for every connection on sigma we had a natural extension a prime over m so we're given a three
5501920	5508800	manifold sigma and we construct we're given a surface sigma and we constructed a helbert space
5508800	5514240	by quantizing the space of connections on sigma and if for every connection on sigma we knew how
5514240	5527120	to extend it over m so if every connection had a natural extension then since an extended connection
5527120	5534400	has an a churned simons invariant not as a number but as a vector in some line then if we had a
5534400	5539760	natural extension of every connection then we could define a natural section of this line bundle we've
5539760	5550640	been talking about well there's no natural way to extend connections in fact there isn't even a
5550640	5557120	continuous engaged invariant way to extend the connections but in what many regard as his greatest
5557120	5563600	insight Richard Feynman taught us more than 40 years ago what to do since there isn't a natural
5563600	5573200	extension we average over extensions and every extension determines some vector in the corresponding
5573200	5579680	line so the average over connections is a vector in the line and as the boundary data vary so we
5579680	5585200	consider for a given connection on the surface all its extensions and averaging over extensions
5585200	5591440	gives us a vector and letting a vary we get a section of that line bundle that I've told you about
5594560	5601760	and this is Feynman's recipe for computing transition amplitudes
5603760	5609040	now of course I've made it sound like a possibly naive idea there wasn't a
5609040	5615200	natural extension so we averaged over them but a not very deep one in Feynman's context
5615840	5620880	the problem or prior he wasn't set up in such a way as to make that sound so much like the obvious
5620880	5626800	thing to try on the other hand what Feynman was trying to do is similar to what we're trying to
5626800	5631040	do in understanding the Jones polynomial in those days there was a theory called quantum
5631040	5635760	macho dynamics that was really a four-dimensional theory but it was only formulated with three
5635760	5642240	dimensional symmetry now Feynman was trying to exhibit quantum macho dynamics in an obviously
5642240	5648800	four-dimensionally invariant fashion here we have a theory the Jones polynomial and its generalizations
5648800	5654480	which is really a three-dimensional theory but the known formulations at most have two-dimensional
5654480	5659920	symmetry or even less in the original versions and we're trying to exhibit it as a three-dimensional
5659920	5665600	theory and we're simply following in Feynman's enormously successful and influential footsteps
5668160	5673600	now I'll in a bit try to make the notion that there is a way to average over this infinite
5673600	5679680	dimensional space of extensions sounds a little more palatable but first let's indicate a few of
5679680	5686080	the consequences well first of all if you believe you can average over connections you can do it
5686080	5690400	even on a three manifold without boundary or at least you can try to consider the case where the
5690400	5697520	boundary is empty so if we're given a closed three manifold well we consider the space of all
5697600	5703760	connections or really connections modular gauge transformations on M and we want to average
5703760	5711040	over connections modular gauge transformations or more conveniently we usually average over all
5711040	5716800	connections including the Fadenov-Paprov ghosts to account for the volume of the gauge group
5716800	5721680	anyway we want to average over all connections and now since we have a closed manifold the
5721680	5726800	churn assignments invariant is really a number so the answer is a number and it's a numerical
5726800	5734960	invariant of the three manifold now this is a very big integral and maybe it's too big for one
5734960	5740000	graduate student to do but we might have two graduate students so we split the problem into
5740000	5745760	two pieces we take what's called a Higard splitting of the three manifold so we have a three manifold
5745760	5752000	x now i've called it i've regarded as a union of m and n m and n are three manifolds with a common
5752000	5758880	boundary with opposite orientation so they fit together to make a nice three manifold x and
5759440	5765200	we fix the boundary values of the connection on sigma and we ask one student to integrate over
5765200	5772400	connection extensions here while the other student integrates over extensions here and one student
5772400	5777040	gets one functional of the boundary data and of course the other student gets the other functional
5777040	5786640	of the boundary data and of course if we fix the boundary data and integrate overall extensions
5786640	5794800	then we've integrated over everything except the values of the connection on sigma and maybe the
5794800	5799280	student's advisor who should do at least part of the work will then do the final integral over that
5799840	5806320	so the two students have constructed these two functionals of boundary data and then
5806320	5811600	perhaps the advisor integrates over the boundary data and that final integral means that we finish
5811600	5816400	the job and we have the invariant of this three manifold but we've obtained that invariant by
5816400	5822720	pairing two pieces one functional of boundary data obtained by one student and the other
5822720	5827600	functional obtained by the other student now these two functionals were sections of our
5827600	5835200	favorite line bundle so what we found is that while each three manifold determines a vector in
5835200	5840800	this space or the other one because of opposite orientation determines a vector in the dual
5840800	5847120	the pairing of the vector in the dual vector is our desired three manifold invariant and therefore
5847120	5852880	we have learned that we are dealing with invariants that are computable from e-guard splitings
5853120	5856880	and more general considerations along these lines
5860800	5864880	lead to a nice formula for the behavior under game surgery
5868160	5875360	so I haven't quite explicitly introduced not invariants but not invariants are introduced
5875360	5881840	similarly by considering a three manifold with knots and considering holonomies of connections
5881840	5889520	around those knots and after formulating the problem for the not invariants then one can push
5889520	5895680	a little farther on this formula by which we compute from e-guard splitings and get a formula for
5895680	5901360	the behavior under game surgery and that formula is really what makes the theory computable because
5902160	5904800	any two three manifolds are related by game surgery
5905680	5912480	and for instance if you want you can use game surgery to reduce anything you want to know about
5912480	5919280	any three manifold to knots in s3 or in some ways it's even simpler to reduce them to braids in s2
5919280	5925280	times s1 because if you get to the braids in s2 times s1 then you really have reduced this more
5925280	5931440	general picture to the original Jones representations of the braid group essentially and their cousins
5931440	5939840	for higher representations and groups and so ultimately you get combinatorial formulas
5941200	5947120	based on game surgery and these formulas have been adopted as the definition in combinatorial
5947120	5956160	approaches uh rachatecan lectured on the um work that uh rachatecan and trev did to rigorously
5956160	5962320	justify the combinatorial formula you get this way by checking the generators and relations
5962320	5967840	of essentially curvy calculus in an elegant fashion that depends on the relations involving
5967840	5978320	quantum groups of course the uh tool that they used uh well the ingredients that come in and
5978320	5985040	doing so are the so-called quantum 6j symbols and the quantum 6j symbols themselves have a natural
5985120	5990880	representation in three dimensions in terms of these path integrals which again is related to
5990880	5996000	the essential properties and is another side of what i mentioned earlier when i noticed that we
5996000	6002000	were getting the kinesian exam logic of the question which one knows is related to uh
6003440	6011760	quantum groups so different ways of looking at this make different aspects of driving quantum
6011760	6017680	groups from quantum filter you see i might remark that to physicists quantum groups are
6017680	6022400	rather funny things because you might say that the name quantum makes it sound like physics
6022960	6029280	and perhaps it does but what quantum is here being used in a rather loose sense quantum means
6029280	6034800	that an algebra in this sense context quantum is being used to mean that an algebra which
6034800	6039840	is commutative or commutative is being deformed so that it doesn't have those properties anyway
6040640	6045840	but quantum mechanics is really a little bit more specific than just deforming commutative
6045840	6050640	algebras to non-commutative algebras quantum mechanics really has to do with quantization
6050640	6058720	of symplectic manifolds the algebra which is being deformed is the uh algebra of functions
6058720	6064000	on a symplectic manifold and it's deformed to a non-commuting algebra of operators on Hilbert's
6064000	6074880	base quantum groups as formulated so elegantly uh involve the deformations of a cross on
6075680	6082160	manifold but not of a symplectic manifold and as such there really a bit outside the
6082800	6091760	conventional framework for quantum mechanics and quantum theory if you wish to uh take the
6091760	6096960	quantum group and reduce it to a more standard object which is quantization of symplectic
6096960	6103120	manifolds or once a complex structure is picked algebraic geometry sections of line bundles
6103120	6109920	over that modular space m sub j this much bigger story with the space of connections and the three
6109920	6117680	dimensional quantum theory puts the quantum group in a framework that really is quantum mechanics
6117680	6125280	and quantum theory of course the drawback is that we're in a much bigger picture which is
6125280	6131360	less obviously computable as so often happens in mathematics and physics the more computable version
6131360	6136400	which is the quantum group doesn't exhibit all the symmetries which are exhibited in the three
6136400	6142960	dimensional story one should think of this as one of many instances where there is a invariant
6143040	6148320	definition which is the definition involving quantum theory on three manifolds and there's a
6148320	6152960	computable definition a manifestly computable definition that doesn't manifestly have all
6152960	6159440	the symmetries which is the one that involves the reduction to quantum groups and the combinatorial
6159440	6168480	approaches now i think i should spend the last few minutes to give you a favor of what path
6168480	6173440	integrals are on here i shall be following as i should have said at the beginning in the first
6173440	6179680	steps of albert schwarz who considered the abelian version of this theory many years ago in the 70s
6179680	6188400	writing it to write a monster racing retortion so i want to say something which is mathematically
6188400	6193520	precise about path integrals though it doesn't give the complete story and it's a challenge to give
6193520	6204160	the complete story so what i'll tell you is if you give a physicist satan seeing a quantum theory
6204160	6210000	that was found behind a bush and has no particular redeeming virtues i will tell you all that can
6210000	6217760	be said about it that that path integrals based on general ideas so the only general thing that you
6217760	6224800	can say in terms of really computing their money so of course even if you've reduced an integral
6224800	6229360	to quadrature and finite dimensions you usually can't compute it and you look for some asymptotic
6229360	6235040	expansions and we will make an asymptotic expansion here which is an expansion in powers of 1 over k
6236640	6240640	so the situation we're in is we have a big infinite dimensional manifold
6240640	6245680	and we're integrating something and the same thing we're integrating is the exponential of i times
6245680	6253600	something else times k so the prototype for this problem um i'm going to simplify it so
6253600	6258720	we really have the gauge group and we should worry about the ghosts the idea of proper of ghosts
6258720	6262640	but pretending they weren't there the prototype is a finite dimensional manifold
6262640	6267760	what they measure and a morse function it doesn't have to be a morse function in general it's a
6268800	6273200	larger class of functions but let's think for simplicity of a smooth function with isolated
6273200	6279200	critical points and then we have a real number and then we want to compute this integral and
6279200	6283920	of course we can't compute it in closed form we can prove it exists but we can't compute it
6283920	6289680	but we can't compute it in an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1 over 2 and that's
6289680	6295360	essentially classical the asymptotics of such an integral is given by stationary phase
6296320	6304560	in fact if f were not a function but were had values in r mod 2 pi z and t was an integer
6304560	6310080	so there were no critical points this would vanish exponentially for large t because of oscillations
6311120	6315520	so the failure to vanish exponentially due to oscillations comes because of critical
6315520	6320160	points where there aren't oscillations the asymptotics are given by stationary phase
6320800	6327200	if pi are the critical points then this has a systematic expansion involving a sum over
6327200	6332720	critical points where the leading term is the value of the integrand at the earth critical
6332720	6340000	points times a power of t that depends on the dimension and then multiplied by a local expansion
6340000	6350080	determined by local data at the critical points so these are the coefficients here are local
6350240	6356400	invariants at the i-th critical point and for instance if near a given critical point you
6356400	6362720	make an expansion so i pick some local coordinates and i want them to be adapted to the measure
6362720	6370720	so that d mu is dx1 up to dxn and then since it's a critical point the function has its value
6370720	6373840	and then the next term is a quadratic term involving the so-called Hessian
6374080	6380480	then by studying the integral the idealized integral we find that the leading term
6381040	6386400	is this animal and that animal involves the determinant of the Hessian while this thing
6386400	6393440	has a determinant because of the existence of a measure here and the condition on the coordinates
6393440	6398640	involves the determinant of the Hessian and involves the signature of that quadratic form
6399040	6407440	so the leading contribution here involves these nice endurance of the behavior near the critical
6407440	6413120	point and then you can compute the higher order corrections involving local behavior near the
6413120	6417200	critical points you need to the only new thing you'll really need is that you'll need to invert
6417200	6423440	this invertible matrix and then the expansion can be described diagrammatically in terms of what
6423440	6436400	physicists call Feynman diagrams now this can be imitated systematically in our problem in
6436400	6441840	fact that's where they're called Feynman diagrams well there's no problem with the notion of a
6441840	6447440	critical point uh for explain that a critical point of this functional is a fault connection
6447440	6454400	up to gauge transformation and for a large class of three manifolds they'll be isolated
6454400	6460080	in general we need to understand how to generalize the previous story which will involve certain
6460080	6466960	integrals of measures that you'll construct well what will happen in fact is that if the critical
6466960	6473840	point isn't isolated this determinant isn't a number but is naturally a measure on the space
6473840	6479920	of critical points so after proper understanding the finite dimensional story you can imitate it
6479920	6485600	here there's no problem with the notion of a critical point there's of course no problem
6485600	6490960	with the notion of the value of deterrence hymens functional at a critical point that's one of
6490960	6496960	these standard invariance of a fault connection well the hashen makes sense after including
6496960	6503360	the ghosts the hashen is a certain elliptic differential operator which i call al well
6503360	6511120	then we need the determinant of l but that's essentially what ray and singer defines and
6511120	6516800	schwarz interpreted in quantum field theory so that the determinant of l is the ray-singer
6516800	6523520	torsion and then we also need the signature of l well l is a quadratic form in infinite dimensions
6523520	6532480	so it has infinitely many positive and negative eigenvalues so we need to define its signature
6532480	6538160	and we need to regularize that but tia petode and singer told us how to do that in the so-called
6538160	6542800	eta invariant and in this problem the eta invariant is the right notion of the signature of l
6544320	6551840	so i've explained the leading contribution for large k to this path integral so we've actually
6551840	6558000	if you like evaluated the path integral in the leading approximation of stationary phase and
6558720	6564000	it involves invariants that are classical namely the more recent of them were defined in the early
6564000	6569600	70s but they're still fairly sophisticated things like the torsion and the eta invariant
6570960	6576000	and the corrections which are only beginning to be systematically investigated mathematically
6576640	6579760	involve what physicists call Feynman diagrams
6579760	6590160	um my student drill born out on has worked at rather precisely the through loop
6590720	6593600	correction to the not invariants and has shown that it's
6594880	6600400	equal to the again classical not invariants which is the derivative of the jones polynomial
6600400	6605280	at q equals one as was the second derivative right as was expected
6605280	6615360	so then the story is that we can carry out the Hamiltonian picture more or less rigorously
6615360	6621680	getting the jones representations and their generalizations the deeper side of the story
6621680	6630480	is certainly the Hamiltonian picture which is a challenge perhaps to understand it comprehensively
6631360	6637520	um in perturbation theory it leads in the leading approximation to these classical but
6637520	6642880	slightly settled invariants with a systematic prescription for generalizing them and computing
6642880	6647760	more elaborate corrections perhaps rather as in some fashion which
6648320	6660160	um in some perhaps rather fashion in the province primarily of experts
6660160	6664560	I certainly couldn't claim to grasp it a block explained in the first lecture
6664560	6668800	some generalizations of more classical invariants
6668880	6671840	thank you
6682400	6688240	yes thank you very much professor britain and the the inform of seminar is finished thank you for
6688240	6699280	attention
6704240	6711280	thank you
6719200	6721280	thank you
6723920	6727280	what is it
6748240	6778080	Now, the professor, Fatih Er, will speak on the work of Week 10.
6778400	6791440	It's a duty of the chairman of the field committee to ask speakers for that session.
6791440	6801280	So as soon as it becomes clear that Witten got a medal, I approached Tatia asking to speak for him.
6802240	6809520	I wanted kind of cover up from a mathematician in the very physical domain
6809520	6817360	to explain to you why it was so natural to give a field medal to a mathematical physicist.
6818240	6826400	And Tatia was very enthusiastic in this, but he told me that unfortunately he cannot come
6826960	6834800	to Kyoto in the end of August. So we decided on the following way that he will send me some text
6834800	6844720	and I will use it in describing of Witten work at this session. So I had got this text
6845360	6852240	and I will read you some excerpts out of it, but it contains no formulas at all. So just to read it
6852240	6856080	maybe it will be a little bit too dull. You have seen transparencies before.
6856880	6866880	So in a way it will be a mixture of ideas, text and some general comments which I will give to you
6866880	6875520	myself and some explanations. So mathematical physics must be considered as a legitimate,
6875520	6884160	it's my belief, must be considered as a legitimate part of mathematics. It was always stimulating,
6885040	6892480	it was always a source of stimulus and inspiration for more theoretical branches of mathematics
6892480	6900160	and we know very many classical examples. But until recent time it was stimulating mostly
6900240	6907760	analysis or in general or part of analysis such like partial differential equations,
6907760	6915200	especially non-linear equations nowadays and so on and so forth. We could call it classical
6915200	6925280	mathematical physics, but in more recent time we witnessed development, another type of mathematical
6925280	6931600	physics which could be in contradiction with previous one called quantum mathematical physics.
6932160	6940800	And this mathematical physics differs mainly, also differs from classical mathematical physics
6940800	6950400	in the use of different domains of mathematics in it or in other words also stimulating different
6950400	6959440	parts of theoretical mathematics. Algebra, geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, complex analysis,
6959440	6967200	all these traditional fields of mathematics now come to modern mathematical physics and vice versa
6967200	6976000	mathematical physics problems arising there in quantum mathematical physics are sources of new
6976000	6985840	problems for this part of theoretical mathematics. And now I read first citation from Atiyah in all
6985840	6992320	this large and exciting field which involves many of leading physicists and mathematicians in the
6992320	6998880	world. Edward Whitten stands out clearly as the most influential and dominating figure,
6999840	7006880	although he is definitely a physicist, here I would add mathematical physicist. His command
7006880	7014240	of mathematics is rivaled by few mathematicians and his ability to interpret physical ideas
7014960	7021360	in mathematical form is quite unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community
7021360	7027440	by brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathematical theorems.
7028960	7039680	Now in Atiyah's text there is elaboration on this general statement and usually the reference
7039680	7047280	is to an important tool of modern theoretical mathematical physics which is called Feynman
7047280	7056720	integral. Feynman integral allows us to write down explicit in quotation marks solution of very
7056720	7064320	complicated problems arising in quantum field theory, quantum mechanics and so on. Quotation
7064320	7074160	marks means that this tool is still heuristic and not not made rigorous, rigorous to the standards
7074160	7084160	which are supposed to be used now. They would certainly satisfy I would think more mathematicians
7084160	7091920	in previous century but or even such people like Elikartan but without more standard of
7091920	7098160	more high standards of rigor they are still non-rigors of course. On the other hand as I will
7098160	7108480	try to explain with the help of Atiyah also it's really a very important tool to find out new mathematical
7108480	7124480	theorems. So the ingredient in the Feynman integral is a functional of some fields. Fields means
7125360	7132880	functions on the some manifold domain so functions could be not necessarily functions but sections
7132880	7139200	of the bundle and so on so could have geometrical origin and this functional is called action
7139920	7148480	and that function x to the i where i squared minus y times action is Feynman functional and the
7151840	7162480	Feynman integral is kind of averaging over of this functional over all possible fields
7162480	7169280	in consideration. It's significant value that is real over measure of course not measure is strict
7169280	7178320	standards. This local which is a product over all points in the domain or manifold
7180000	7190800	of differentials of these fields so to say. So the answer is a number that of course depending
7190800	7196960	on what we what problem we have in consideration for instance we have domain the boundary or we have
7198560	7205600	some asymptotical conditions then so there are some which characterize the the main
7205600	7212800	of this geometrical object we are average over the function would be also functional of this data
7212800	7222320	and so quite a rich object. So the example well of course physicists after Feynman after 48
7222320	7230960	use it mostly for their own needs and then a function a was action in the statistical theory
7230960	7239440	of mechanics of some particular Hamiltonian system but in more general use which gradually
7240320	7247280	developed in this quantum mathematical physics and especially by the influence of very modern
7247840	7253440	things there in particular what's called thing theory people began to use more
7253920	7261360	geometrical objects in these actions and fields. So examples of possible fields could be loops
7262160	7270400	or connections it's called young wheels field in physics or metrics in physics it would be
7270400	7279360	most useful in the case of gravity and so on and so forth. So Witten have shown a very
7282000	7291200	ingenious way of using functionally integral to produce purely mathematical theorems.
7292080	7305840	Now I cite from here in his paper on supersymmetry and Morse theory yes excuse me Witten's paper on
7305840	7311360	supersymmetry and Morse theory is obligatory reading for geometers interested in understanding
7311360	7316960	modern quantum field theory. It also contains a brilliant proof of classical Morse inequalities
7316960	7323200	relating critical points to homology. The main point is that homology is defined
7323200	7331760	via Hodge harmonic forms so the Laplacian will play a role of the Schrodinger operator
7331760	7340000	of quantum mechanics and you can write down Feynman integral using this action.
