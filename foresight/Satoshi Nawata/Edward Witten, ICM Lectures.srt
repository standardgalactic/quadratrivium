1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great privilege on this occasion to present Edward Whitten

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,320
for his plenary address, string theory, and geometry.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,760
As you may have noticed, the program of this Congress, the Berkeley Mathematical Congress

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,320
of 1986, differs from its predecessors in the much greater emphasis given to the relationship

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,840
of mathematics to the sciences, both natural and artificial, to physics and to computer science.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,960
This is true particularly of the plenary addresses, but also of the remainder of the

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,120
program. And it reflects in my view a profound change which has taken place in the

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,920
structure of mathematics at its cutting edge, what has been described by some of my equativeness

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,680
as a profound reconvergence of mathematics for the sciences. Edward Whitten epitomizes this

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,840
tendency in his sharpest form. By training in profession, he is a physicist, he is a professor

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,640
in the Department of Physics at Princeton, and by achievement, he is physicist at the highest

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,080
level, and a mathematician at the highest level. He has been one of the leading workers in recent

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,800
years in the ongoing development of string theory. He has been one of the, perhaps, the leader in

14
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,200
introducing ideas of conceptual originality and mathematical sophistication and that theory.

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,000
And he has also used those ideas in a very remarkable way to get important mathematical

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,480
results of a high degree of originality, both in concept and execution. In their lectures,

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,720
both Richard Schoen and Izzy Singer have referred to some of these results.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Another one to which they have not referred is his highly original proof of the Morse inequalities

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,560
using the eigenvalues of Laplacians on manifolds, the first original proof of that set of ideas

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,720
in 50 years. The material of which he is going to speak reflects one of the most powerful trends

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,320
in contemporary mathematics and the most powerful and sometimes controversial trend in theoretical

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,720
physics. The development of fundamental ideas concerning the unity of the theory of fundamental

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,400
particles and of gravitation in a highly sophisticated and elaborated mathematical form.

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,000
We welcome him here as a symbol of this movement, which will continue, I am sure,

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,760
in even sharper forms in the decades to come. Professor Whitten.

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Professor Whitten.

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Professor Whitten.

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,760
In 20th century physics, there have been two really basic ingredients,

29
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
which are first of all general relativity, which is Einstein's theory of gravity,

30
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
and secondly quantum field theory, which is the basic framework for our understanding of

31
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
essentially everything else in physics other than gravitation.

32
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
Though they both play a role in a description of the same natural world,

33
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,880
these two theories enjoy their successes in very different realms.

34
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:18,000
General relativity has its successes in the realm of astronomy, and quantum field theory

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,440
is the framework for successful descriptions of many aspects of the properties of atoms,

36
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:37,040
molecules, and subatomic particles. Most of the really important developments

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,000
in fundamental physics since about 1930 have been developments in quantum field theory,

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,240
or certainly in quantum mechanics, and for much of this time physics and mathematics

39
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,480
had relatively little interaction compared to that in many previous epochs.

40
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,480
One obvious reason for this perhaps is that in the 20th century mathematics advanced into

41
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,160
seemingly abstract realms unrelated perhaps it would seem to the humdrum world of the theoretical

42
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,000
physicist, but I think in large part the reason that the interaction of mathematics and physics

43
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,040
was more limited in the last half century than in previous epochs was because the physical

44
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,760
problems that arose in quantum field theory, which was the central framework for most

45
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,400
progress in physics, did not seem to give rise to many interesting mathematical structures.

46
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:43,360
By the mid-1970s this changed mainly because of developments in physics. By the mid-1970s

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,640
the quantum field theories which had emerged to play a central role in physics were the so-called

48
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,920
non-abillion gauge theories, theories in which one of the main ingredients is a vector bundle

49
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,200
over space-time with a non-abillion structure group. These theories raised more interesting

50
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,480
and significant issues in geometry and topology causing a more significant interaction of physics

51
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,880
and geometry starting about 10 years ago perhaps than had been possible during most of the epoch

52
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,880
in which quantum field theory played its central role in physics. In fact one of many strands leading

53
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,040
to Donaldson's work, which we heard about a couple of days ago, originated from this interaction

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:36,240
of physics and geometry. Now progress in quantum field theory led by perhaps a decade ago to the

55
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,160
beginning of an enriched interaction of physics and geometry, but I believe that all the same this

56
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,360
interaction would remain relatively limited if it were only a question of quantum field theory.

57
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,040
It's really in trying to go beyond the limits of quantum field theory that physicists have come

58
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:03,680
upon mathematical frontiers. Perhaps the fundamental limitation of quantum field theory

59
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,480
is the one I've already alluded to. It's only one of two fundamental theories in physics

60
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,000
and in fact quantum field theory turns out to be incompatible with that other basic ingredient in

61
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,840
20th century physics which is general relativity. You can attempt formally to combine these two

62
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,560
theories by so-called quantization of general relativity, but this leads to all kinds of

63
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:35,440
nonsensical formulas. Now in the early days of quantum field theory it was not at all obvious

64
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,520
that this was a central problem. Quantum field theory faced many problems in its early days.

65
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,440
It wasn't even obvious at the outset that the quantum theory of electricity,

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,640
quantum field theory of electricity, which was the original quantum field theory,

67
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,880
really made any sense. In time though the other difficulties of quantum field theory were overcome

68
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,440
and it became clear that quantum field theory was an adequate framework for describing all

69
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,160
of the forces of nature except gravity. Though in the course of learning how to do so,

70
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,800
physicists were led to develop quantum field theories with a richer geometrical contents,

71
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,400
such as the non-ability engaged theories I alluded to previously. As the other difficulties

72
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,680
of quantum field theory were overcome the incompatibility with general relativity emerged as

73
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:32,800
the limitation of this framework. Now general relativity is based of course on Riemannian

74
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,080
geometry which is certainly one of the richest frameworks for our understanding of ordinary

75
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,080
geometry and asserting that general relativity which is based on Riemannian geometry is incompatible

76
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,880
with quantum field theory. It must mean that some proper physical theory which will successfully

77
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,240
generalize general relativity and reconcile it with quantum field theory must in some way

78
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,040
be based on some generalization of Riemannian geometry compatible with the requirement of

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:15,120
quantum mechanics. Now experiments can only provide us with indirect clues about how we

80
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,440
should go beyond ordinary Riemannian geometry as a framework in physics and the reason for this is

81
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,200
that to our great regret gravitational effects are unmeasurably small in experiments that probe

82
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,480
quantum field theory and the same is true the other way around. There is actually only one example

83
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,080
in the previous history of physics in which a theory was invented even though the experimental

84
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,600
clues were only indirect. The one other success of that nature was general relativity itself

85
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,400
it was discovered in what we might call a logical way Einstein first beginning only with the very

86
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,360
general clue which was that special relativity was incompatible with gravity. Einstein first

87
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,320
formulated the physical ideas for reconciling two inconsistent theories then found the right

88
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,520
mathematical framework which was general Riemannian geometry and finally he invented the theory.

89
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Now of course we'd like to emulate this history but that is easily said than done many ambitious

90
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,200
physicists and mathematicians have gone off into the wilderness in search of some fundamental

91
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,560
generalization of geometry that would reconcile gravity with quantum mechanics but generally

92
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:44,480
speaking they've come back empty handed if at all. While direct assaults on this problem have yielded

93
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,040
little progress seems to have fallen from the sky essentially through the largely chance discovery

94
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,200
of something called string theory. Now the people who invented string theory beginning in the late

95
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,520
1960s weren't aspiring to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics they weren't

96
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,880
hoping to generalize Riemannian geometry in fact the ambitions were not in the realm of our

97
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,920
discussion at all. String theory was originally developed as a theory of the so-called strong

98
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,800
interactions the nuclear forces that keep nuclei together despite the electric repulsion among

99
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:31,120
protons. Even as a theory of strong interactions string theory was discovered largely by accident

100
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,320
following its discovery which essentially occurred when one of the formulas in string

101
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,200
theory was written down by Veneziano with very slender motivation in 1968. Following the essentially

102
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,320
accidental discovery it was vigorously developed in this early period drawing which upwards of

103
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,000
500 papers were written led to an extremely rich mathematical structure which fascinated people

104
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,040
by its richness yet never advanced toward solving the original problem which motivated this work of

105
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,320
strong interactions and in fact this whole line of development was abruptly abandoned by most

106
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,960
physicists around 1974 when it became clear that it was not the correct approach to strong interactions.

107
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,600
While it was generally abandoned because of not being the solution of the original physical

108
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,560
problem the structure retained its fascination provoking work in various areas and eventually

109
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:40,320
being revived in the 1980s as an approach to quantum gravity. Now this subject has already

110
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,520
an extremely long and complex history and I fear that if I tried to survey even the high points of

111
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,600
this history it would take the rest of the lecture. I've written here some of the dates and

112
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,040
names of some of the main developments but it would be impractical to explain even a few of them

113
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,080
completely. I will be talking about some ingredients from some of these developments

114
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
but I'm not going to attempt to explain this history.

115
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,360
Now as I've indicated string theory essentially fell from the sky by chance

116
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,320
with some special formulas of this theory being discovered with a rather strange motivation

117
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
and it gradually being learned that these formulas were special cases of a richer structure

118
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,360
in which one has penetrated in times deeper levels but probably not very far toward the

119
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
deepest levels that underlie this theory. The situation in string theory is roughly as if

120
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,960
Romani and geometry had been sorry it's roughly as if general relativity had been invented without

121
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,280
having first invented the logical framework for this theory which is Romani and geometry.

122
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,840
Einstein happens to have followed Riemann but it's imaginable to have conceived of a planet

123
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:06,720
where the problem that Einstein posed of reconciling gravity with special relativity

124
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
would have existed on a planet where general relativity was unknown. Conceivably on such a

125
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,760
planet general relativity would somehow be invented in some obscure way without its logical

126
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,240
underpinnings Romani and geometry being clear. Whether or not that's happened on some planets

127
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,160
in the universe in which theoretical physics may have been developed it certainly has happened

128
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,760
on planet earth in the case of string theory. Because of the peculiar way that string theory

129
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,640
has been discovered I cannot do what I would dearly love to do and a lot of hope will be done

130
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,520
by some speaker at some future congress of the international congress of mathematicians

131
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,320
which is to explain the basic concepts of curvature connections and Romani and manifolds

132
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,640
which should play in string theory the role that Romani and geometry plays in general relativity.

133
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,560
I can try to explain some of what presumably are the preliminaries for this theory

134
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,200
and in sketching what I mean by these preliminaries perhaps I'll give you an

135
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,680
analogy with general relativity. In Romani and geometry one has some curved manifold

136
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:23,920
and if you consider at a point the tangent space to this curved manifold of course the

137
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,920
tangent space is a linear space and one thing you certainly have to be able to do in order

138
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,600
to work with Romani and geometry is to understand a little bit of elementary linear algebra

139
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,480
so that you can carry out linear operations in the tangent space. Roughly speaking our present

140
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,360
understanding of string theory was as if we were trapped in the tangent space of Romani and manifold

141
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,440
not understanding the basic frameworks that we would need the basic logical concepts that we

142
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,080
would need to go coherently beyond linear operations in the tangent space.

143
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,280
So the analog and string theory what the role which is played by linear algebra as a preliminary

144
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,920
to work in the tangent space of Romani and manifold that role the analogous role is played

145
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,240
in string theory by much richer mathematical structures which are the theory of Riemann

146
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,000
surfaces modular forms and what I will loosely describe as infinite dimensional representation

147
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,600
theory. Roughly speaking just as one needs a little linear algebra before trying to learn

148
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,080
Romani and geometry so one needs to know something about Riemann surfaces and infinite

149
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:40,480
dimensional representation theory before trying to learn string theory. So we could say that

150
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:49,360
general relativity requires linear algebra for its linear approximation but the fundamental ideas

151
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,440
in the theory are really connections curvature and Romani and geometry. String theory requires

152
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,160
Riemann surfaces and infinite dimensional representation theory for its linear approximation

153
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:07,040
and what should really belong in the lower right hand corner of that square is I think to my thinking

154
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,000
and the thinking of many other physicists really the central problem in theoretical physics.

155
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,400
Now I've stressed the incompatibility of quantum field theory with gravity but in fact there are

156
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,520
certain other problems in our understanding of physics that we would like to overcome

157
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,400
and one of the most fundamental problems is simply that there are too many conceivable

158
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,120
theories permitted by the general principles that we have. Quantum field theory would permit

159
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,800
an infinity of theories and the logical framework of general relativity would also permit an

160
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,960
infinity of theories of which Einstein's is only the prototype. Of course if you try combining

161
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,200
these two frameworks you have not an infinity of theories but zero which is the assertion

162
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,040
that they're incompatible but if you could have combined quantum field theory with general

163
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,920
relativity with no particular difficulties then you actually would have had an infinity of possible

164
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:13,040
descriptions of the natural world which certainly would mean some basic gaps in your understanding.

165
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,480
So in a sense the blessing there might be a blessing in disguise in the difficulty of

166
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,920
reconciling these two frameworks either would separately permit an infinity of theories together

167
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,200
they seem to permit none and hopefully the proper understanding will lead to a finite set of theories

168
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,800
that reconcile them. To briefly illustrate what I mean in saying that the general ideas of

169
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,600
Romanian geometry would permit an infinity of theories the basic concept in general relativity

170
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,320
is really that spacetime which I'll call m is a pseudo-Romanian manifold it has a metric tensor g

171
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,760
and Riemann tensor the Ritchie scalar is what I've called r. Einstein's basic principle

172
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,280
was to describe nature by some geometrical action principle some geometrical integral

173
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,480
over spacetime was to be the action of this theory and while he wrote the simplest action

174
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,280
there are an infinity of more general action principles more general geometrical

175
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,840
invariance integrated over m that would give conceivable generalizations of general relativity

176
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:28,640
within the logical framework in some sense you might consider this to be the most

177
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,360
elementary member of the clan but when you consider another point which I'm about to

178
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,480
allude to presently in fact what has an infinity of theories without a evident most elementary example

179
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,880
so apart from the inconsistency of quantum field theory and general relativity we would

180
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,160
certainly like to overcome the fact that either of those separately leave us with too many theories

181
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:01,440
in fact with an infinity of conceivable theories to illustrate the other deficiency of general

182
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,840
relativity let me briefly discuss almost flat solutions of this theory of course in everyday

183
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,640
life we don't notice that spacetime is curved spacetime is flat in everyday life and of course you

184
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,120
can do a better job of probing for curvature if you measure over larger and larger scales

185
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:25,360
every romanian manifold is almost flat on a small scale gauss as many of you know measured the

186
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,760
angles between three high mountains and found pi as the sum confirming that one mount on the scale

187
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,360
of the alps spacetime is roughly flat and astronomers do much better on even larger scales

188
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:45,120
so we introduce as a good approximate description the flat metric eta the diagonal metric with these

189
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,440
eigenvalues we imagine a small deviation h from a flat metric we write the spacetime metric

190
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,040
as the min-count metric plus a small fluctuation

191
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,880
well if we insert this form of the metric in the Einstein equations we'll get a non-linear

192
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,560
equation but since spacetime is nearly flat let's linearize it if we linearize it we will get some

193
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,520
linear equation for h which will be some perturbation of the Laplace operator acting on h giving zero

194
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,320
well this equation has wave-like solutions the simplest being the plane wave I've written here

195
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,560
and these wave-like solutions are quite analogous to the corresponding wave-like solutions of Maxwell's

196
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,840
equations which are light waves so in this way we learned that general relativity permit predicts

197
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,080
gravitational waves a prediction of that theory which emerged clearly when the theory was formulated

198
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,480
in 1915 though it had been conjectured by Poincare some 10 years earlier and incidentally a prediction

199
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,640
which was finally tested indirectly by observations of radio waves from pulsars just a few years ago

200
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,040
now when this prediction was made it was a prediction of a new type of wave not a new

201
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:10,560
type of particle but in fact in quantum mechanics waves and particles are two facets of the same thing

202
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,440
so this prediction of a new kind of wave is actually a prediction of a new kind of particle

203
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,960
Einstein merely aspired to reconcile gravitational forces with special relativity

204
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,320
but in trying to do so he actually predicted a unified

205
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,680
not just a theory of gravitational forces but a unified theory of gravity and matter

206
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,760
gravitational forces were unified with this peculiar new kind of matter which was predicted

207
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,200
namely gravitational waves the Einstein wasn't satisfied with his unifications since he eventually

208
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,400
hoped to unify gravitational forces not with some exotic form of matter that he predicted but unknown

209
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,680
at the time but with the forms of matter that were known about so this is often described by

210
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,320
saying that Einstein didn't succeed in unifying gravity with matter but a better statement would

211
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,280
be to say that on a logical plane he unified gravitational forces with matter but wasn't

212
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,240
satisfied with the form of matter that the resulting theory predicted

213
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,760
so on a conceptual plane it's a great triumph that merely trying to describe gravitational

214
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,440
forces finding the logical framework which is romanian geometry writing down the simplest

215
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,240
equations in that framework which are nonlinear equations one then found that one had not merely

216
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,000
a theory of gravitational forces but a unified theory that unified gravitational forces with matter

217
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,320
however this wonderful unified theory has a couple of flaws it's incompatible with quantum field

218
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,880
theory that of course wasn't known at the time since quantum field theory was invented later

219
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,560
but evident even at the time was that the forms of matter predicted in this theory

220
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,240
were less rich than those that we observe

221
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:16,160
now I would next like to give a heuristic account of why string theory might what string theory is

222
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,960
and why it might be hoped to improve upon general relativity the framework for this really does

223
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,720
require some preliminaries about quantum field theory and I do hope to give a brief

224
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
comment about quantum field theory later

225
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
but without developing all the requisite preliminaries of quantum field theory

226
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,160
I would like to at least explain heuristically how one stumbles upon some generalization

227
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,480
of general relativity in the form of string theory

228
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,640
and in doing so I will be explaining conventional things in quantum field theory

229
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,360
in a way which is closely related essentially to the viewpoint introduced by poliakov some years

230
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:10,080
ago well in quantum field theory the scattering of particles such as the gravitons of general

231
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,560
relativity are described by Feynman diagrams now a Feynman diagram is a spacetime history of a

232
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:30,560
scattering process in this transparency I've sketched a scattering a spacetime history

233
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,160
time runs vertically on the diagram space or one of the space dimensions at least runs horizontally

234
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,240
particles have been emitted and absorbed at these points a b c and d the solid lines are actually

235
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,360
curves in spacetime along which a particle traveled and x y z and w denote points in

236
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,880
spacetime at which one particle split into two or in which two particles recombined into one

237
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
so this actually is a sketch of a sequence of events in spacetime

238
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,240
and if you start with some theory like general relativity

239
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,960
then the rules of quantum field theory will give you

240
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,400
algorithms for associating probabilities with spacetime history such as that one

241
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,720
actually you start with some abstract graph gamma and then you imagine some map of gamma

242
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,640
into spacetime which i'll call capital x x denotes a map of gamma into spacetime

243
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,160
of course this graph gamma is a collection of intervals if we map such an interval into

244
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,800
spacetime we can compute its arc length and the sums of those arc lengths is what i'll call i of x

245
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,040
the length of the image of this map graph gamma in spacetime under some map in which gamma is

246
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:11,600
mapped into x of gamma so let omega of gamma be the space of all maps of the graph gamma into

247
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:18,080
spacetime now in conventional quantum field theory of the last 50 years

248
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,160
even though this isn't quite the conventional way of describing the usual structures one almost

249
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,480
injured way to describe the usual thymine diagrams is as integrals over this path space omega of gamma

250
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,760
so we have an abstract graph gamma we map it into here i've sketched the image of that graph

251
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:45,200
such a map omega gamma is the base of all such maps i is the length of the image of the graph

252
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,960
under that map we try to integrate over omega of gamma e to the minus the length of the image of the

253
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,600
map times some facts i'll explain presently the local factors at the branch points in the graph

254
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:07,440
now one thing you'll note here is that infinite dimensional integral the integral over the

255
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,960
space omega of gamma of all conceivable maps of this graph into spacetime all conceivable

256
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,040
continuous maps of gamma into spacetime that's a characteristic infinite dimensional integral

257
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,240
that appears in prime and path integral formulations of quantum mechanics in quantum field theory

258
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:34,000
now one thing which we'll notice here is that when we're mapping this graph gamma into spacetime

259
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
gamma is not a manifold it's almost a one-dimensional manifold but actually it's a

260
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
one-dimensional manifold with singularities p q r and s and the ills of quantum field theory

261
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,200
all come about because gamma isn't a one-dimensional isn't a manifold but has singularities

262
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:02,720
we're taking this graph which is a one manifold with singularities we're mapping it into spacetime

263
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
and two bad things happen because of the fact that gamma isn't a manifold

264
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,120
first of all well we have to define this infinite dimensional integral and in fact

265
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,400
there is a there's a lot of experience and even some theorems in constructive field theory

266
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,600
about defining such infinite dimensional integrals and one thing we know about it

267
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,960
is that it will work a lot more nicely if you tried mapping a smooth one manifold into spacetime

268
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,240
rather than a graph with singularities when we map such a graph into spacetime we encounter

269
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,880
the possibility that the image of p q r and s in spacetime make coincide and in fact after

270
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,120
we've learned to define such infinite dimensional integrals in the first place we learned that

271
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:58,560
this integration is badly behaved near the region where x of p x of q up to x of s all coincide

272
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,840
this bad behavior makes all quantum field theories difficult to define but actually

273
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,000
impossible in the case of general relativity so our first problem in quantum field theory

274
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,680
its overall mathematical difficulty and in particular its incompatibility with gravity

275
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,600
arises because gamma isn't a manifold secondly because gamma isn't a manifold we have these

276
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,360
special points p q r and s and uh we had a nice simple factor in the integrand the exponential

277
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,400
of minus the area minus the length of the image of gamma in spacetime but since there are these

278
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:46,320
special points p q r and s it makes sense as those points are singled out to take some local

279
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,400
functional of the behavior of x near one of those points phi here is a local functional of x of p

280
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,200
and the derivatives of x near p

281
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,120
it makes sense to pick such a local functional and introduce a factor in the integrand at each of

282
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,640
those singular points p q r and s and in fact with certain very simple limitations each choice of

283
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,400
this local functional phi of p gives you a different quantum field theory the infinity of quantum

284
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,760
field theories corresponds to the infinity of local factors that can be introduced at those branch

285
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,560
points well of course you might think that we're straining things a bit and that there would be

286
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,920
a minimal model where we don't introduce these factors but one of the surprises perhaps is that

287
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,920
that isn't true if you take a nice geometrical theory like general relativity and yang mills theory

288
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,240
and transform it into this framework you'll definitely need some suitable local factors

289
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,960
at those points and on the contrary the theories that wouldn't have those local factors or would

290
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,120
have simple local factors turn out to be quantum field theories that don't have interesting

291
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,120
geometrical content so this is a freedom not only it exists in principle but we have to use it and

292
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:13,120
we do use it for the quantum field theories that are of most interest in physics so we have a variety

293
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,600
of problems which have their origin in the fact that gamma isn't a manifold suppose though that we

294
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:28,960
wish to ask an engineering shop let's say to make a physical model of the graph gamma well we probably

295
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,800
to find this graph as consisting of mathematical lines but the craftsman doesn't have mathematical

296
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,960
lines at his disposal so perhaps if we're lucky he uses thin tubes

297
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,840
and if he uses hollow tubes and joins them smoothly as a plumber does

298
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,800
then we can replace this graph by something for which it's more easy to make a physical model

299
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,320
which looks very similar from a big distance and that is actually why string theory if you'd

300
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,720
coarsely looks rather like quantum field theory but there's a fundamental difference in replacing

301
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,120
these mathematical lines with little tubes we've replaced the one manifold with singularity gamma

302
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:24,880
by the smooth remun surface sigma now in some sense in some sense the graph gamma

303
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,080
may be an approximation to sigma but the fundamental difference is that sigma is a smooth

304
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,480
manifold which gamma isn't and as a result in replacing gamma with sigma we will we in fact

305
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,160
overcome both the infinities in quantum field theory and also the lack of uniqueness the lack of

306
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,200
uniqueness came from the ability to attribute special factors with these points upon losing

307
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,600
those special points we in fact encounter a situation in string theory where we replace gamma

308
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:04,320
with sigma in which there are very few theories that can be formulated

309
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,320
now

310
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:22,720
the other main occurrence which arises when we replace gamma with sigma

311
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,600
let's take a close-up of this picture which I won't draw completely

312
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,440
remember this is actually a picture of a process occurring in spacetime

313
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,120
so time is running upwards in the picture and this graph gamma which I've drawn is actually

314
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:49,760
happening in spacetime it actually describes the propagation in spacetime of point particles

315
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,240
which for general relativity are the quantum counterparts of the waves that I sketched earlier

316
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,760
so I'm going to take a blow-up of a little piece of that picture

317
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:09,120
our blow-up is the propagation of a particle in time in spacetime if we take its locus at given

318
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:16,080
time we get a single point or at most a finite set of points the fact that we might get a finite

319
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,800
set of points instead of a single point leads to the fascinating story of creation of matter and

320
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,720
antimatter or perhaps it would take us too far afield to discuss it so I'll imagine that we find

321
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,560
the locus at a given time to be a single point and that corresponds to saying that this graph

322
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,120
is a theory of a point particle propagating in spacetime if in the same way we take the locus

323
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:45,120
at fixed time of one of these tubes it consists of a circle or perhaps a finite collection thereof

324
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,320
so we've actually replaced the point particle of field theory with

325
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:01,440
the oscillating circle you see I remarked that on a conceptual plane Einstein had unified

326
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,920
gravitational forces with some kind of matter but the matter in question wasn't rich enough

327
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,280
and it wasn't rich enough essentially because that point particle which was the locus of a

328
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,920
curve at given time didn't have enough freedom when we replace our graph with a Riemann surface

329
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,440
sigma the locus at given time isn't a point or finite collection of points but consists of

330
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,880
circles and one of those circles or in that case closed strings will be rather like a

331
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,360
violin string except without fixed endpoints physically it will oscillate in time and like

332
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,920
a violin string it will have an infinite set of harmonics which will correspond to different forms

333
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:49,200
of matter so in fact replacing gamma with the Riemann surface sigma means that one is dealing

334
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,560
with a theory with much richer forms of matter it's not at all obvious from what I've said that

335
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,440
these richer forms of matter will be at all like what we find in the real world but upon closer

336
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:16,240
investigation it turns out that they are so the seemingly innocent step of replacing gamma by sigma

337
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,560
leads us to a more unique theory with also a much richer form of matter

338
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,600
and it leads us at the same time into the world of Riemann surfaces and modular forms

339
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,240
and representation theory of certain infinite dimensionally algebras such as diff s1 the group

340
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:48,320
of difumorphisms of s1 which will act on this circle now I have another transparency which aims

341
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:56,080
at recapitulating what I've been saying so in a theory like general relativity we have really

342
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,520
basic formulas like the geometrical action principle the integral over spacetime of the

343
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,920
Ritchie scalar the beauty or lack of beauty of such a theory should be judged by the beauty of

344
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,960
its fundamental principles our aspiration would be to generalize this elegant action

345
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,280
geometrical action principle to some richer structure that will be compatible with quantum

346
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:29,440
field theory a direct and even indirect attempts to do so haven't been successful on the other hand

347
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,440
if we consider not the really fundamental formulas of Riemannian geometry but some drive formulas

348
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,000
such as the ones I've been discussing involving maps of graphs gamma into spacetime

349
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,720
then it turns out that some of the drive formulas can be generalized

350
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,480
now of course if at the top of everyone's mind was that we think of general relativity in terms

351
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,720
of maps of graphs into spacetime then this generalization would be more obvious and perhaps

352
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,240
would have happened sooner what makes it less obvious is that although this is closely related

353
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,880
to standard descriptions of what one gets from quantum field theory it's not the most standard

354
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,120
description by any means I haven't explained the steps in quantum field theory which lead from

355
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,080
fundamental formulas to less fundamental formulas involving these graphs it's possible to explain

356
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,640
it but would have taken an excessively long exposition if we work on this less refined plane

357
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,000
we find we can generalize the less fundamental formulas of quantum field theory getting something

358
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,880
called string theory which overcomes many of the difficulties for instance the lack of uniqueness

359
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,160
of quantum field theory which in this framework arose from the fact that the Ritchie scalar is

360
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,200
only one of many possible geometrical action principles in this less refined framework

361
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,640
is associated with the fact that gamma isn't a graph sorry gamma is a graph but not a manifold

362
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,360
and that is eliminated in going to Riemann surfaces and so on with other points I've already

363
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:09,600
illustrated so what has happened in the invention of string theory is that in a peculiar process

364
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,520
of trial and error with many historical stages one has succeeded in generalizing not the truly

365
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,960
fundamental formulas of older physical theories but some of the derived formulas

366
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,440
now just as

367
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,840
this picture with the graph gamma is to be derived from some much more fundamental viewpoints

368
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,560
the same ought to be true with our generalization of it involving Riemann surfaces

369
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,560
and elucidating what lies above the Riemann surface in the sense that general relativity

370
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,000
lies above these graphs is what I've alluded to as the mystery of unraveling the logical structure

371
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,240
behind string theory and I personally believe that it's a very fundamental problem for both

372
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:02,640
mathematics and physics one peculiarity is that ordinarily the beauty of a theory is to be judged

373
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,960
by its fundamental principles and not to be looked for in these derived formulas derived formulas

374
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,640
like the ones involving graphs and maps of graphs into spacetime are necessary tools if you want to

375
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,520
determine the quantitative predictions of a beautiful theory like general relativity but

376
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,080
they're not the basic formulas and they're not necessarily beautiful in fact they're ordinarily

377
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,880
not beautiful one of the surprises in string theory is that the Riemann surface generalization

378
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:39,040
of the theory of those graphs is very beautiful involves fascinating properties of Riemann surfaces

379
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,840
modular forms infinite dimensional representation theory algebraic geometry some of the many

380
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:54,960
beautiful aspects of this were described in a marvelous article by manin which was submitted

381
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,520
to this conference but which regrettably he wasn't able to deliver here because of not being allowed

382
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,600
to attend the conference but singer presented them very elegantly in a talk on tuesday afternoon

383
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,720
it comes one shouldn't expect beauty in trying to generalize a secondary formula

384
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,280
but actually in the case of string theory one finds that the generalization of this picture

385
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,360
with the graphs leads to very fascinating and beautiful mathematics and I personally would get

386
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,240
conjecture that what lies above here will in some sense stand in the same relation to general

387
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,760
relativity that the marvelous automorphic forms and algebraic geometry that enters in Riemann surfaces

388
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,600
uh path integrals Riemann surfaces compares to the Euler Feynman diagrams of field theory

389
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,840
now I haven't uh been able to explain how one goes from here to here that would be

390
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,160
rather too time-consuming I do want to use the remaining terms to the remaining time

391
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,240
to explain briefly a little bit of the flavor of what it means when we talk about the maps over

392
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,920
into infant dimensional spaces that are involved in dealing with these graphs gamma or the Riemann

393
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,760
surface sigma in their own terms so in the rest of this talk we're going to be working on this lower

394
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,200
half of the page without discussing how this one is associated with conventional field theory

395
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,880
now in doing this I will be giving a very brief uh introduction to quantum field theory

396
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,520
since I will have to attempt to extract one or two ideas in about 15 minutes

397
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:53,120
you see quantum field theory exists on the upper half of this page because

398
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:58,800
we started with quantum gravity or attempted quantum gravity in going here but quantum field

399
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,840
theory lives again at the lower half of this page because these infinite dimensional integrals

400
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:10,400
are really formulas in quantum field theory now quantum field theory has been for most of its

401
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:18,000
60 years almost the private preserver physicists and even now it has not yet emerged as a mathematical

402
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,800
tool but there are reasons to believe that quantum field theory might emerge as a mathematical tool

403
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,560
in the near future reasons independent of string theory for believing that because there are at

404
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,960
least two areas where progress in mathematics has come to the brink of quantum field theory

405
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,680
that is areas of mathematics where some characteristic features of quantum field

406
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,120
theory have begun to be recognized as significant one of these is the representation theory of

407
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,720
affine lee algebras which frankle reviewed yesterday and which is closely related to the

408
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,840
hamiltonian picture of certain quantum field theories and the other involves recent work in

409
00:44:55,840 --> 00:45:01,120
arithmetic geometry which we will hear about in the next lecture where the derock determinant

410
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,120
which is one of the really fundamental characteristic ingredients in quantum field theory

411
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,680
has begun to play an important role

412
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:20,880
so in a choice of topics for an extremely brief comment on quantum field theory i'm going to

413
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,880
talk about points that are in string theory but might prove to be related in further developments

414
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,680
to the areas of mathematics i've just mentioned let then sigma be a Riemann surface perhaps with

415
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,840
boundary let phi taking sigma into the real numbers r be a real valued function and then let's define

416
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,240
an action very natural action which is called the action functional of free boson field theory

417
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:55,520
the integral over sigma of this two form del phi wedge del bar phi where del and del bar are the

418
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,920
del bar the natural operators associated with a complex structure on sigma

419
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:13,680
that f be a real valued function on the boundary of sigma and that omega sub f of sigma

420
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,280
be the space of real valued functions on sigma whose restriction to the boundary coincides with f

421
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:28,880
now we didn't need a Riemannian metric on sigma in defining the action i but if sigma

422
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,120
is endowed with a Riemannian metric and not just with a conformal structure then this affine space

423
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:42,240
omega f of sigma likewise has a natural metric which i've defined here by giving the distance

424
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,880
between two functions phi and phi prime now in finite dimensions a Riemannian metric certainly

425
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,360
induces a measure the so-called square root of the determinant if you wish to write it in formulas

426
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:03,040
and hoping that that works in infinite dimensions we might try to define what i call z sub f of sigma

427
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:11,360
which is the integral of e to the minus the action over the space of functions whose

428
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
restriction to the boundary coincides with f that's what i call it omega f of sigma

429
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,320
the integration measure is the one which we hope was induced by that Riemannian metric on sigma

430
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,320
well how are we going to integrate in infinite dimensions well physicists actually deal with

431
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,400
infinite dimensional integrals that are very difficult to define mathematically in which you

432
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,360
can't write explicit formulas but i happen for practice to have given you one for which we can

433
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,440
write an explicit formula i in this case was a quadratic functional of phi so we're integrating

434
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:55,120
the exponential of minus a quadratic functional that's a Gaussian integral and we know that

435
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,880
Gaussian integrals are integrals which are easy to evaluate in finite dimensions let a be a

436
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,520
quadratic form in finite dimensions if we're integrating in finite dimensions the exponential

437
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:13,040
of minus a quadratic form we can carry out that explicitly in terms of the square root of the

438
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:21,920
determinant of a or if we have a natural basis in phi so it makes sense to speak of eigenvalues

439
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:29,360
of a we can write the answer in terms of eigenvalues of a so we can try to interpret

440
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,880
Gaussian integrals in infinite dimensions in a similar way first consider the case where the

441
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:41,200
boundary of sigma is 0 the same action i wrote earlier can be written like so in a way that

442
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,600
makes the conformal invariance less obvious but some of the differential geometry more obvious

443
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:52,560
perhaps what the operator that appears here is the ordinary Laplacian

444
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,800
and delta plays the role of our quadratic form in finite dimensions so we should study the eigenvalue

445
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,360
problem delta phi equals lambda phi it's a nice eigenvalue problem a nice discrete set of eigenvalues

446
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,160
and formally we would like to define our integral as the product of the minus half powers of the

447
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,600
eigenvalues well of course this has a zero eigenvalue which we should throw away and it also is a

448
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:33,280
little bit divergent because of the infinite factor but nonetheless there are many natural ways of

449
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,640
regularizing this one elegant way of doing it is so-called zeta function regularization

450
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:46,320
we introduce the zeta function as sum over eigenvalues lambda to the minus s and then we

451
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,800
write a formula which would be correct in finite dimensions if this were finite sum

452
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,480
with an infinite set of eigenvalues the zeta function converges for a large enough real part

453
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:02,720
of s and we take here its analytic continuation to s equals zero this would be our zeta function

454
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,680
definition and there are many other definitions such as the polyvlar's method used in quantum

455
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:20,800
field theories some 40 years ago if now the boundary of sigma is not empty and we're given

456
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,640
a real valued function on the boundary we'd like more generally to define the integral not

457
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:33,440
over all maps of a segment of spacetime but only maps of segments are but only maps which coincide

458
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,600
with f on the boundary well for f equals zero what we've already said is quite adequate

459
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,200
for f equals zero we're still integrating a Gaussian integral on a linear space

460
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,200
we study the eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions that the eigenvalue vanishes on the

461
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,000
boundary and we make again the same definition

462
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,240
if f isn't zero then by classical theorems we find some unique there's a unique minimum

463
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:14,400
of this functional subject to the condition that the boundary value is equal to phi

464
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,640
let phi not be the extremizing function and that our integration variable phi be

465
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,920
phi not plus m correction

466
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,360
then we can easily work out by manipulations that would be valid in finite dimensions

467
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,520
the appropriate formulas it turns out in this case that the action because it's quadratic

468
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,840
for phi is the sum of the separate pieces and if phi has boundary value f then phi prime has

469
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:54,160
boundary value zero show shifting the integration variable from phi to phi prime we would work out

470
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:09,040
a formula now in reaching this point we've needed a metric on sigma we needed to claim that these

471
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:17,520
spaces um omega of sigma had had measures and we induced the measures from Riemannian

472
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:24,240
structures on sigma so since we need matrix on sigma to reach this point

473
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,160
these formulas are actually not conformally invariant if we make a conformal rescaling of

474
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,400
the metric of sigma which of course won't change its conformal structure as a Riemann surface then

475
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,040
this formula won't be invariant however it's possible to work out simple formulas

476
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,560
for how it transforms under conformal transformations to physicists those simple formulas involve the

477
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:02,880
so-called theory of anomalies and to mathematicians they involve the theory of the determinant line

478
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,920
bundle as it is entered in the work of faultings deline and the tn singer and more recently freed

479
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:21,920
in bismuth and others i've given a case um uh well more generally uh if one considers simple

480
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:30,160
generalizations of this one will be led to generalizations of these formulas whose behavior

481
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,160
under conformal rescalings of the metric involve a quite rich theory which involves the theory of

482
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,280
certain homomorphic line bundles over the modular space of Riemann surfaces in its mathematical

483
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,640
exposition but it wouldn't be practical to enter into that here i'll contend myself simply with

484
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:57,360
saying that i've tried to give a prototype of um some of the manipulations by which were led

485
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:04,720
to investigating determinants of operators such as the lapossian and for surfaces without boundary

486
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:12,400
such that we wouldn't have that factor here this is a simpler prototype of some of the things they

487
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:25,600
enter in the next lecture now i'd like to conclude by uh returning to our more general themes

488
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,320
i suppose it would be plausible to conjecture that in some suitable sense

489
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,520
the number of really fundamental problems in mathematics is infinite

490
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,120
but i personally believe that the number of really fundamental physics problems is finite

491
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,160
and therefore by definition a physicist who has the privilege of working on such problems is lucky

492
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,680
since in the course of time progress will slow either by solving them or by failing to make

493
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,160
further progress if it's true that the number of really fundamental physics problems is finite

494
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,280
then the number of episodes in the future in which there will be really fundamental

495
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:11,200
interaction of mathematics and physics will likewise be finite however there are reasons

496
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:24,720
for believing that the next few decades will be one of those epics

497
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:36,240
so

498
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:49,440
so let us begin informal seminar on which professor witten will speak on gage theories and

499
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,480
john's polynomials uh professor witten's work was already introduced to you in the first day

500
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,480
so he need no more introduction so i give floor to professor witten please thank you

501
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:15,280
i'm very glad this is an informal talk as a result of which my wife hasn't required me to wear a suit

502
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,680
so i will be describing

503
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,000
a particular three-dimensional quantum gauge theory which

504
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:37,360
puts the john's polynomial and it's in a manifestly three-dimensional form exhibiting

505
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:46,720
its symmetries which are not obvious from the original definitions and also although i won't

506
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,360
have a chance to talk about this exhibits its formal analogies to modular moonshine that is

507
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:59,520
moonshine in the theory of the monster group and the theory of our finely algebras modular invariance

508
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:07,520
in those theories a donaldson theory and other things and also gives a context in which the quantum

509
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:16,400
group uh quantization of an ordinary league group arises from ordinary geometry for special gauge

510
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,760
groups this theory is also related to some other things including three-dimensional quantum gravity

511
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,880
the castan invariant and some of the fashionable models of high temperature superconductivity

512
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:38,640
so i thought that uh well i'd begin the talk with a little bit of the end just uh as an

513
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:45,120
inducement so remember that on the first day in explaining von jones's work

514
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:53,040
john burman explains a bit about skein theory and also indicated the history of the skein theory idea

515
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,600
that i'm about to summarize and the people who contributed to it so this is a very pretty picture

516
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:06,160
where you have three pieces of knots these pictures are meant as pieces of very complicated

517
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,120
knots which i won't draw but you have some complicated knot and inside the dotted line it

518
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:17,440
just looks like this this or this and you consider three knots which are the same outside the dotted

519
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,200
lines of some projection but inside a little sphere which has been projected onto the plane

520
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,680
you have these three different pictures and you have three complex numbers alpha beta and gamma

521
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:37,360
and you define an invariant of a knot by saying that the invariance of three pictures that are

522
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:44,000
the same outside and look like this inside weighted by complex numbers alpha beta and gamma add up to

523
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,680
zero by an elementary induction it can be seen that this property uniquely defines a knot invariant

524
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,680
if it exists but the fact that it does exist is considerably deeper and in a way is this part

525
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,920
of the surprise of the jones polynomial and its generalizations the humphly and patricki

526
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:11,600
tragic and colvin polynomials and others now the explanation we will get for this beautiful picture

527
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:18,240
is as follows you see the boundary of this sphere has four mark points where the knots pass through

528
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,800
the sphere and we will find a natural way to associate a two-dimensional vector space which

529
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:32,080
i call h sub s to every sphere s with four mark points it's a two-dimensional vector space and

530
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:39,680
that's why there are three terms in this scan relation the association of the vector space to

531
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:47,600
every sphere has the property that every bordism determines a vector in this space now by a bordism

532
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:54,720
i mean a three manifold which has for boundary this sphere and in which the mark points are

533
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,120
boundaries of bits of knots the knot these lines are only permitted to end at those four points

534
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,240
so this picture here we had the same boundary in the three cases but the interiors are three

535
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:17,760
different bordisms and in this theory every bordism determines a vector in h sub s

536
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:25,120
and we will have in this theory a knot invariant in which the details of the interior of s don't

537
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:34,320
matter all that matters from the mess that might be inside s is this vector size of b in the

538
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:42,640
Hilbert space on the boundary now a simple fact of linear algebra is that any three vectors in a

539
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:49,680
two-dimensional space obey a linear relation alpha psi one plus beta psi two plus gamma psi three is

540
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:55,760
zero for some complex numbers alpha beta and gamma in this case we make the three vectors

541
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:03,840
determined by these three bordisms and they base on linear relation and if you glue them into some

542
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:09,680
more complicated picture so that these are little pieces of knots which are constant outside this

543
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,240
sphere and look like this inside then this relation is a relation between the values of the invariant

544
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:23,600
for three different knots so the existence of this theory now the characteristic of the theory

545
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,560
will be the values of alpha beta and gamma and such a theory predicts the validity of scheme

546
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:33,280
theory that is the ability to define a knot invariant this way for a particular value of

547
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,520
alpha beta and gamma to explain scheme theory in general we need a two-parameter family of

548
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,760
such constructions so that the ratios of alpha beta and gamma are variable

549
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,200
so that's the answer we will eventually get although perhaps not completely explained today

550
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:59,200
for the validity of scheme theory it comes fundamentally from the existence of a knot invariant

551
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:07,520
which can be computed well where the details of what's inside any little sphere don't matter

552
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,680
all that matters is the vector that that bordism determines in the two-dimensional vector space

553
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:19,120
now put this way

554
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:30,400
it's an elementary topological idea but its geometrical realization will bring us into

555
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,960
matters that may seem either far afield at first sight in the realm of quantum field theory

556
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,160
while we will be doing quantum gauge theory so we pick a gauge group g

557
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,640
g is a v group which for economy of exposition we take to be connected and simply connected

558
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,760
this simplifies the it's not essential but it simplifies the discussion because then every g

559
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,560
bundle on a three-man hold is trivial we don't necessarily assume that g is compact although

560
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:06,960
we will sometimes assume it again for simplicity only we assume that g is simple in that case

561
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,240
up to a scalar multiple there is a unique invariant quadratic form on the le algebra of g

562
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:18,560
and we denote it as the trace we denote the pairing of two elements as the trace of their product

563
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,240
the motivation being that it can actually be realized as the trace in some representation

564
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,720
and the normalization I'll give in a second is such that for SUM this scalar product is the

565
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:42,960
trace in the n-dimensional representation now a g bundle e on a four-man hold x has a characteristic

566
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:50,960
number which can be computed by taking the curvature of any connection and integrating trace of f

567
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:58,000
wedge f and our normalization of the trace is such that this is integer valued

568
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:07,680
so that's an in a topological invariant or in a four-man hold the corresponding secondary

569
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:14,000
turn simons invariant isn't a topological invariant but is in an invariant that depends on a connection

570
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:22,880
if we have a three-man fold m and a g bundle over it and a connection on that bundle then

571
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,440
there is a corresponding secondary invariant so the bundle is called e we extend the the bundle

572
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:37,840
on the connection over some four-man hold b and we define the three the three-dimensional secondary

573
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:45,040
invariant is the integral over the bounding four manifold of the object which on a closed four

574
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:52,800
manifold would have two pi times integer periods the fact that for closed manifolds the periods are

575
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:59,440
two pi times integers means that for a manifold of fixed boundary this depends on the extension only

576
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,800
up to a multiple of two pi integral multiple of two pi so this is well defined with values in

577
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,360
real numbers modulo two pi times integers or in other words it's exponential times the square root

578
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:22,240
of minus one has is well defined with values in u one now we're going to be studying a certain

579
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:29,280
quantum gauge theory in which the Lagrangian is a positive integer k times this functional i of a

580
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:39,200
and this integer k is related as it turns out to the level in the theory of affine leochvus

581
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:50,160
now as is standard in quantum field theory the discussion has two halves one is the construction

582
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,280
of Hilbert spaces and in this case they will be generalizations of the jones representations of

583
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:01,840
the break group and the second part are path integrals although it's hard to explain this

584
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:07,680
just in one lecture the questions we will ask and the methods we use are not dreamed up on a

585
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,720
not hope basis for this particular problem there are the techniques of quantum field theory adapted

586
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:18,000
to this situation albeit a somewhat unusual situation in which some steps that are usually

587
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:27,040
relatively trivial become non-trivial now the goal of the first step of the discussion

588
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,920
is to associate a Hilbert space h to every two manifold sigma every closed Riemann surface

589
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:40,720
sigma and this is accomplished in general in quantum field theory this is a comp so we're in

590
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,000
three dimensions but in the Hamiltonian version we are in one dimension less here two dimensions

591
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,400
we consider manifolds without boundary and for every such we wish to find a Hilbert space

592
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:56,800
and this Hilbert space is constructed by quantizing a suitable suitable syntactic

593
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:02,480
manifold which in general is the modular space of critical points of the Lagrangian

594
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,840
on a particular three manifold which is the surface times R1 that being time

595
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:16,560
now floor discussed the same functional in another context and as he explained a critical

596
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:22,400
point of this functional is a fault connection or in other words a representation of the fundamental

597
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:33,520
group of m into g now since pi1 of m is the same as pi1 of sigma the modular space of such

598
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,520
representations is the same as the modular space of fault connections on sigma and this is the

599
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:48,240
space we will quantize now this space is often studied by people studying Riemann surfaces

600
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,200
but here in principle it's arising as a representation space of a certain three manifold

601
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,600
that happens that that degenerates to representations of the fundamental group of

602
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:04,480
sigma because m is contractable to sigma but in principle this space is originating with a

603
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,240
three-dimensional origin which is the beginnings in a very elementary level of the three-dimensional

604
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:17,040
explanation of the Jones polynomial now as a preliminary which is usually trivial in quantum

605
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,640
theory but here non-trivial we have to consider what kind of object is the Lagrangian on a three

606
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:28,880
manifold with boundary and here I will be explaining what constant and serial call

607
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,680
pre quantization in this context but I'll be explaining it in some detail when we actually

608
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:41,120
get to quantization I won't go into such detail so remember how we defined the action functional

609
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:47,120
we had a three manifold with that boundary then we regarded it as the boundary of some

610
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:55,520
poor manifold b and the action was defined as an integral over b so implicit in this is that

611
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,000
the boundary of m was zero so that m was the boundary of some b now we want to let the boundary

612
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,960
of m be non-zero and this definition therefore doesn't make sense and therefore we don't have any

613
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,040
we in fact no no longer have this turn simons functional as an r mod 2 pi z valued functional

614
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:23,520
however what is the nature of the obstruction that a curly a will be the space of connections

615
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:31,200
on the surface sigma then we can't define this exponential of the turn simons function as a

616
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:37,200
number but we will define it as a section of a line bundle over the space of connections

617
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:44,080
or more precisely a connection on the three manifold has boundary values in a and for every

618
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:51,040
point in a we have a one-dimensional complex vector space the fiber of a line bundle at that

619
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,880
point and this thing will not be a number but will take values in the fiber of that line bundle

620
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,800
so the line bundle is really defined just by asking what's the obstruction to defining this

621
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,760
as a number while the obstruction was that we had an open three manifold and if we knew how to

622
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:16,560
close it we could get a number again so we just exploit that systematically we have this space of

623
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,320
connections to describe a line bundle over the space of connections we must for every point in

624
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:28,080
that line in that space describe a one-dimensional complex vector space visa bay and we declare

625
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:34,480
that visa bay has a basis which we call a prime for every extension of a over any three manifold z

626
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,640
z is any three manifold and a prime is any extension of the connection over z

627
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:47,520
actually we also extended the bundle and connection over z and for every such extension

628
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:55,280
this line has a basis a prime well i need to tell you how to compare two different basis elements

629
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,240
and i can do this because if a prime and a double prime are too such extensions

630
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:06,000
individually they don't have a churn simons invariant but they have a relative churn simons

631
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,360
invariant because they have the same boundary by definition so if i glue them together with

632
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:17,600
opposite orientation we get a closed three manifold and then the connection on the closed

633
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:23,760
three manifold has a number a complex number valued invariant and we just say that a prime is a

634
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:31,760
double prime times this number so now although we have no natural basis in this one-dimensional

635
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:37,600
vector space we've defined a one-dimensional vector space for every connection on the surface

636
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:45,040
and thus as the connection on the surface values and varies in the space of all such connections

637
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,560
we got a line bundle l over the space of connections on sigma

638
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:57,600
now this line bundle has an actual unitary connection in fact if we're given a path in

639
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,160
the space of connections so a1 and a2 are connections on sigma on the surface sigma

640
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:10,400
and gamma is a path between them in the space of connections that path gives us a connection

641
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:15,040
on a certain three manifold the three manifold is sigma times the unit interval

642
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,360
and one sigma times the unit interval we take the connection which is trivial in the in this

643
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:28,640
direction in which in this direction is a1 at this end and a2 at this end and interpolates

644
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:35,120
between them by the given path so that's a connection on a particular three manifold

645
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,560
and now if you tell me and how to extend a1 over some three manifold then i know how to

646
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:49,840
extend a2 over some three manifold because the interpolation from a1 to a2 which we just discussed

647
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,520
can be glued on to your interpolation and that gives a unitary connection on this line bundle

648
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,960
in other words if you give me a trivialization of the fiber at a1 i've given you a trivialization

649
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:10,320
of the fiber at a2 which depends on this path and we interpret that as parallel transport

650
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,760
of the trivialization here to a trivialization here along that path

651
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,000
now let g hat be the gauge group of maps of this surface into g

652
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,800
then g hat acts on the space of connection along sigma and with a small effort that

653
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,080
actually requires a slight elaboration of what i've said the g hat action lifts to an action on

654
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:42,960
this line bundle preserving the connection now we have a projection from the space of connections

655
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:48,480
through connections modular gauge transformations we can ask whether the line bundle with connection

656
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,360
descend and they don't the standard criteria are in debate if you take a little loop downstairs

657
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:00,880
and lift it to a loop upstairs the polynomial on the loop will depend on the left and therefore

658
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:07,120
there's no way to make these things descend but if we restrict ourselves to five connections

659
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,280
the space of five connections on sigma then by elementary considerations you see that this

660
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:20,000
line bundle and connection do descend to a line bundle and connection over the space of

661
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,560
five connections divided by gauge transformations and that was the modular space of five connections

662
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,160
on this surface which i indicated earlier was going to enter

663
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,840
so we get a line bundle with connection over the space of five connections on sigma

664
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,080
its curvature can be computed in an elementary fashion and is the standard symplectic structure

665
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,760
which was first provided to gauge theories by a tia and bat in a paper that caranel and

666
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:58,800
back mentions is the standard symplectic structure on this manifold now these things

667
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:05,840
have been studied in the past in other methods and in particular this line bundle and connection

668
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:12,000
in special cases are usually constructed by picking a complex structure on sigma

669
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,440
and using algebraic geometry if you pick a complex structure on sigma so that sigma is

670
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:24,240
a complex Riemann surface then by the Narasimhan-Sashadri theorem this modular space is a modular

671
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:30,720
space of holomorphic bundles on sigma and then one has the determinant line bundle with its

672
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:37,360
racing or quillen metric and its curvature as computed by quillen is precisely the same

673
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:46,560
curvature as this thing so there's a holomorphic construction in special cases like the unitary

674
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:53,200
group or for any group for special values of k there's a holomorphic construction of this line

675
01:15:53,200 --> 01:16:00,160
bundle that depends on picking a complex structure on sigma what we've achieved by the

676
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:10,400
construction I've given is that we've given a purely topological construction it doesn't

677
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:16,320
depend on any complex structure the mapping class group acts in a fashion which is visible

678
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:25,200
essentially and at the same time we've related the construction to three manifolds what we've

679
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,960
achieved is actually what constant and surya called pre quantization in this problem we've

680
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,760
constructed what is called the pre quantum line bundle and we've constructed it in a way that

681
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:41,200
doesn't break this topological invariance of the problem and you see the construction was naturally

682
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,040
related to thinking of it in relation to three manifolds which is what we want because we want

683
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:54,240
to do a three-dimensional problem now going back to the original question I raised of what is the

684
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,960
term simons and variant i of a if a is a connection on a three manifold with boundary well we see that

685
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:07,520
total logically it makes sense as a suction of this line bundle that we introduced or more

686
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:13,600
exactly a vector in the appropriate fiber of that line bundle because any trivialization of the line

687
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:21,440
bundle which is an extension a bounding three manifold an extension of the connection enables

688
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:34,480
us to make sense of that thing as a number so this is pre quantization in this situation

689
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:43,200
now not only have we pre quantized that is we've constructed the appropriate line bundle over the

690
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:50,800
right module space which has the right unitary connection and the right curvature and without

691
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,760
breaking any of the symmetries of the problem but we're in a very good situation because this

692
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:02,000
modular space is the sympathetic quotient of an affine space the affine space is the space of

693
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,120
connections and you see we took two steps we restricted to five connections and we divided

694
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:14,000
by the gauge group and although i won't explain it those compound steps are mathematicians call

695
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,560
them the sympathetic quotient and for physicists they go back to newtons use of symmetries to

696
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:28,320
reduce a problem in mechanics but anyway this rather complicated modular space of fault connections

697
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:35,280
we're seeing it in relation to an affine space a with a group action and this relation of course

698
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:45,040
between the two is what was exploited by atea and bat to compute the chronology of this modular space

699
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,960
but here we're seeing the same we will be using the same relation in a different way

700
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,360
that's appropriate to this particular quantum field theory

701
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,360
now we want to quantize and i won't have time to explain quantization in as much detail as i

702
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:12,320
gave for pre quantization but quantization means associating a helbert space h which should be

703
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,360
canonically associated with the data and the data are a modular space and the loin bundle with

704
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,280
connection but these data were canonically determined by the surface sigma as we saw

705
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:29,600
so we will really be canonically associating a helbert space with the surface signal

706
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:38,480
now what quantization means in general is a long story but if there were a natural

707
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:46,640
complex structure j on this mod space m obeying certain conditions most importantly that the

708
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:52,000
symplectic structure the curve the curvature of this connection should be of type one one

709
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,040
so that the line bundle will get a natural homomorphic structure

710
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:01,120
and in addition the symplectic structure should be positive relative to that complex structure

711
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,400
if there were an actual complex structure then the quantum helbert space would be you see

712
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,560
if we had such a complex structure then our modular space we take as a complex manifold

713
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,680
and the conditions mean that the loin bundle is a homomorphic loin bundle and at level k

714
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,320
we will take the kth power of that loin bundle and take its homomorphic sections

715
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,560
and that would be our helbert space for the level k theory with this gauge group

716
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,040
and associated with this surface sigma

717
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:43,760
while there isn't a natural complex structure on m but for every choice of complex structure

718
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:50,720
on this underlying surface sigma we have a hodge decomposition of cohomology you see the tangent

719
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:57,440
space for this modular space is the Durand cohomology of sigma with values in a twisted bundle

720
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:03,280
and if we complexify it then it has a hodge decomposition and that hodge decomposition

721
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:10,080
is really then a complex structure on this modular space in fact it's precisely the

722
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,440
complex structure predicted by the Narasimha and Sashadri theorem and I will call it by the

723
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:22,640
same name j so for every complex structure j on the surface we get a complex structure j

724
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:28,240
on this modular space and thus by the definition on the last transparency

725
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,840
for every complex structure j we can make this definition but if j is not natural then neither

726
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:44,000
is curly h so we have a definition of curly h but it depended on j so I'll call it curly h sub j

727
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:53,200
and because of the j dependence well this situation to begin with is fibrous over the

728
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:58,960
space of all complex structures on sigma but it trivially reduces to the space of complex

729
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:05,040
structures up to isotope or in other words to take more space so we really have a situation

730
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:11,280
that's fibrous over take more space we'll have this family of hybrid spaces fibrous over take more

731
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:21,680
space actually without mentioning it I started to assume a transparency or two ago that this

732
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:30,880
well I didn't prove that the hodge decomposition gave a complex structure that really at that

733
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:37,520
point was assuming the case of a compact group for other classively groups we'd get something but

734
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,760
not quite this so we're now assuming for the moment that we're dealing with a compact group

735
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,480
now we wanted a single helbert space and we have a family of them and of course to get back to the

736
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,760
situation of a single helbert space what we wanted is a natural flat connection on this bundle

737
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:00,960
such a flat connection since the base take more space is contractible such a flat connection

738
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,080
would give us a natural identification of the fibers such a connection can be explicitly and

739
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:13,280
rigorously constructed as I did along these lines with axolot and telepiedra using two facts

740
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:22,000
the first fact is that if we were quantizing an affine space such a fat connection exists

741
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
because of the stone von Neumann theorem on the unique representation of the

742
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,760
Heisenberg group and physicists think of this fat connection as the infinitesimal generator of

743
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:38,320
what we call bugolubov transformations and then one can push down from an affine space to a

744
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:45,360
synthetic portion by restricting to the G invariant subspace now for finite dimensional affine

745
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:52,160
spaces these two facts will give the result a priori here the affine space is infinite dimensional

746
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:57,760
only the synthetic portion is finite dimensional so what one has to do is to take the formulas

747
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:04,560
which would be valid a priori in the finite dimensional case and do a little bit of geometry

748
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,680
to verify them and in fact modify them slightly so that they make sense in this case for only

749
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:17,360
downstairs you have a finite dimensional story now the fault connection one gets this way

750
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,680
or I've written it in the plural because there were different groups and levels

751
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:29,680
these fact actions since the mapping class group acts here one really gets representations of the

752
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:38,160
mapping class group and as was first perceived by Tsuchiya and Kanya in a work that was part of

753
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:43,920
what made possible the soil development these are generalizations of the Jones representations

754
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:50,240
of the braid group to get precisely the Jones representations you would take sigma the surface

755
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:55,200
to have Gina zero and you would have to include knots and mark points in a way that I haven't

756
01:24:55,200 --> 01:25:02,480
indicated moreover the equations that define this fact connection are the generalizations to

757
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:07,760
genus G of the Keynesian exam logic of equation which we've heard so much about in so many different

758
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:17,040
talks at this congress starting with Jim Bo's talk explaining part of the work of Jim Fed and

759
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:22,560
including unexpected applications to number theory that were mentioned in one of the primary

760
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:30,480
addresses yesterday now this construction of this particular file connection for compound G

761
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:37,280
has been obtained in other ways where the original results came from conformal field theory about

762
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:42,400
six years ago by Konishnik and Samochikov and Gina zero and Aguchi and Ugari some years later

763
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:50,560
at genus one and these authors were studying the well what's sometimes called the West

764
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,920
Amino Novikov-Witton model of conformal field theory and then these constructions were formatted

765
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:03,120
rigorously at an arbitrary genus by Tsuchiya at all Tsuchiya talked about it yesterday

766
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:11,120
and there was a simple argument well this a simple sketch of an argument by Siegel in the

767
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:18,880
Swansea proceedings from two years ago also it's possible to construct this connection by pure

768
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,200
algebraic geometry and this has been done by Hitchin and by Balanson and Karzhan

769
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,480
the construction I've indicated

770
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:40,720
is natural in relation to three dimensions in the sense that it's the one that arises naturally

771
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:46,720
as the solution to a quantization of this pre-quantized symplectic manifold and

772
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,360
it extends to other classes of gauge group which we hope is may also be the case for some of the

773
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:58,400
other approaches ultimately in fact with some minor modifications relatively minor modifications

774
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:03,920
of what I've said it's possible to carry out a similar construction if G is a complex semi-simple

775
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:13,680
e-group now perhaps I'll devote one transparency to a site digression so far there are no results

776
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:19,520
about this problem for other classes of e-group which were like to study and notably for non-compact

777
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:26,800
real forms even in the simple case of SL2R now in a very precise sense which would take us far

778
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:32,240
field to really explain this subject is a generalization of representation theory and from that

779
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:36,640
point of view the facts I've stated aren't too surprising so in representation you know well

780
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:42,160
that compact groups are the easiest followed by compact scripts and that the non-compact

781
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,800
real forms are an order of magnitude harder and difficult to study in a unified fashion

782
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,400
so I've told you that again in this context I had a transparency alluding to different

783
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:59,520
approaches for the compact groups and the corresponding problem for the complex groups

784
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:06,800
is definitely harder and is much less well understood but it is tractable it's the next

785
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,000
case after the compact groups it leads of course to infinite dimensional helbert spaces just as

786
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,320
in representation theory where the unitary representations are infinite dimensional

787
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,560
and the solution of this problem for complex groups is related to compact groups

788
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:28,160
much as in the case of representation theory since there are no results for the non-compact

789
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,880
real forms one doesn't know what will happen but either there's some reasonable way to solve

790
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,600
this problem which might well lead to some new viewpoint in representation theory or this problem

791
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:43,200
might be affected with more elaborate versions of the usual difficulties in representation theory

792
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:55,760
well we now come to the deeper part of the story and while I wish to emphasize that what I've said

793
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:03,520
up until this point is very precise mathematically in proceeding we will have to base ourselves

794
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,440
for a while on the massive experience in theoretical physics in the last 40 years

795
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,360
but at the very end we will get back to the realm of

796
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,760
precise rigorous mathematics as of our period so

797
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:26,480
I might say as a general role I'm explaining a particular quantum field theory and in this

798
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,280
particular quantum field theory the deeper results are based on the ideas that I will indicate

799
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,200
but that's there's a similar statement that can be made about

800
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:43,760
other quantum field theories of geometrical interest for instance if one is interested in

801
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,600
what was called by Conway and Calbert as monster moonshine in the theory of the monster

802
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,160
simple e-group the quantum field theory explanation for it is based on the same

803
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,880
Feynman-Pathens a goal that I'm about to tell you about together with the conformal field theory

804
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:05,920
constructed by Frank Lepasky and Merman so in general I'm about to tell you the aspect which

805
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:17,440
Fadeev stressed in his lecture on the opening day the aspect of quantum field theory ideas

806
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:22,400
which is perhaps most indigestible mathematically but which usually leads to the deepest results

807
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:31,040
so the heuristic motivation for this well we've made an association of Hilbert's bases with

808
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:37,600
surfaces by picking a gauge group on a level k and quantizing and this association is somewhat

809
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,600
analogous to the association of a surface with its let's say complex cohomology first cohomology

810
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:50,320
in each case a diffeomorphism of surfaces induces some map on these spaces

811
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:58,720
and in the case of cohomology if you pick a bound in three manifold that actually determines

812
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:05,200
a Lagrangian subspace in the first cohomology group namely the subspace of things that extend

813
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:12,640
over the three manifold and you may ask whether there's some analog here

814
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,960
a surface is sitting there with its first with its h1 but if you give a three manifold

815
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,320
suddenly that determines a subspace a preferred subspace of h1 you can ask what's the analog here

816
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:33,440
and now just for fun let's guess what it might be of course I'll make a slightly biased guess

817
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:41,920
if for every connection on sigma we had a natural extension a prime over m so we're given a three

818
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,800
manifold sigma and we construct we're given a surface sigma and we constructed a helbert space

819
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,240
by quantizing the space of connections on sigma and if for every connection on sigma we knew how

820
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:07,120
to extend it over m so if every connection had a natural extension then since an extended connection

821
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:14,400
has an a churned simons invariant not as a number but as a vector in some line then if we had a

822
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:19,760
natural extension of every connection then we could define a natural section of this line bundle we've

823
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:30,640
been talking about well there's no natural way to extend connections in fact there isn't even a

824
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:37,120
continuous engaged invariant way to extend the connections but in what many regard as his greatest

825
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:43,600
insight Richard Feynman taught us more than 40 years ago what to do since there isn't a natural

826
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:53,200
extension we average over extensions and every extension determines some vector in the corresponding

827
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:59,680
line so the average over connections is a vector in the line and as the boundary data vary so we

828
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:05,200
consider for a given connection on the surface all its extensions and averaging over extensions

829
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:11,440
gives us a vector and letting a vary we get a section of that line bundle that I've told you about

830
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:21,760
and this is Feynman's recipe for computing transition amplitudes

831
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:29,040
now of course I've made it sound like a possibly naive idea there wasn't a

832
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:35,200
natural extension so we averaged over them but a not very deep one in Feynman's context

833
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,880
the problem or prior he wasn't set up in such a way as to make that sound so much like the obvious

834
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:46,800
thing to try on the other hand what Feynman was trying to do is similar to what we're trying to

835
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,040
do in understanding the Jones polynomial in those days there was a theory called quantum

836
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,760
macho dynamics that was really a four-dimensional theory but it was only formulated with three

837
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:02,240
dimensional symmetry now Feynman was trying to exhibit quantum macho dynamics in an obviously

838
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:08,800
four-dimensionally invariant fashion here we have a theory the Jones polynomial and its generalizations

839
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:14,480
which is really a three-dimensional theory but the known formulations at most have two-dimensional

840
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,920
symmetry or even less in the original versions and we're trying to exhibit it as a three-dimensional

841
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:25,600
theory and we're simply following in Feynman's enormously successful and influential footsteps

842
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:33,600
now I'll in a bit try to make the notion that there is a way to average over this infinite

843
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:39,680
dimensional space of extensions sounds a little more palatable but first let's indicate a few of

844
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:46,080
the consequences well first of all if you believe you can average over connections you can do it

845
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:50,400
even on a three manifold without boundary or at least you can try to consider the case where the

846
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:57,520
boundary is empty so if we're given a closed three manifold well we consider the space of all

847
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:03,760
connections or really connections modular gauge transformations on M and we want to average

848
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:11,040
over connections modular gauge transformations or more conveniently we usually average over all

849
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:16,800
connections including the Fadenov-Paprov ghosts to account for the volume of the gauge group

850
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,680
anyway we want to average over all connections and now since we have a closed manifold the

851
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:26,800
churn assignments invariant is really a number so the answer is a number and it's a numerical

852
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:34,960
invariant of the three manifold now this is a very big integral and maybe it's too big for one

853
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,000
graduate student to do but we might have two graduate students so we split the problem into

854
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,760
two pieces we take what's called a Higard splitting of the three manifold so we have a three manifold

855
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:52,000
x now i've called it i've regarded as a union of m and n m and n are three manifolds with a common

856
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:58,880
boundary with opposite orientation so they fit together to make a nice three manifold x and

857
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:05,200
we fix the boundary values of the connection on sigma and we ask one student to integrate over

858
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:12,400
connection extensions here while the other student integrates over extensions here and one student

859
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:17,040
gets one functional of the boundary data and of course the other student gets the other functional

860
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:26,640
of the boundary data and of course if we fix the boundary data and integrate overall extensions

861
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:34,800
then we've integrated over everything except the values of the connection on sigma and maybe the

862
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,280
student's advisor who should do at least part of the work will then do the final integral over that

863
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:46,320
so the two students have constructed these two functionals of boundary data and then

864
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,600
perhaps the advisor integrates over the boundary data and that final integral means that we finish

865
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,400
the job and we have the invariant of this three manifold but we've obtained that invariant by

866
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:02,720
pairing two pieces one functional of boundary data obtained by one student and the other

867
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:07,600
functional obtained by the other student now these two functionals were sections of our

868
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:15,200
favorite line bundle so what we found is that while each three manifold determines a vector in

869
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:20,800
this space or the other one because of opposite orientation determines a vector in the dual

870
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:27,120
the pairing of the vector in the dual vector is our desired three manifold invariant and therefore

871
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:32,880
we have learned that we are dealing with invariants that are computable from e-guard splitings

872
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,880
and more general considerations along these lines

873
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,880
lead to a nice formula for the behavior under game surgery

874
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:55,360
so I haven't quite explicitly introduced not invariants but not invariants are introduced

875
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:01,840
similarly by considering a three manifold with knots and considering holonomies of connections

876
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:09,520
around those knots and after formulating the problem for the not invariants then one can push

877
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:15,680
a little farther on this formula by which we compute from e-guard splitings and get a formula for

878
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:21,360
the behavior under game surgery and that formula is really what makes the theory computable because

879
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,800
any two three manifolds are related by game surgery

880
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:32,480
and for instance if you want you can use game surgery to reduce anything you want to know about

881
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:39,280
any three manifold to knots in s3 or in some ways it's even simpler to reduce them to braids in s2

882
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:45,280
times s1 because if you get to the braids in s2 times s1 then you really have reduced this more

883
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:51,440
general picture to the original Jones representations of the braid group essentially and their cousins

884
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:59,840
for higher representations and groups and so ultimately you get combinatorial formulas

885
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:07,120
based on game surgery and these formulas have been adopted as the definition in combinatorial

886
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:16,160
approaches uh rachatecan lectured on the um work that uh rachatecan and trev did to rigorously

887
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:22,320
justify the combinatorial formula you get this way by checking the generators and relations

888
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,840
of essentially curvy calculus in an elegant fashion that depends on the relations involving

889
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:38,320
quantum groups of course the uh tool that they used uh well the ingredients that come in and

890
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:45,040
doing so are the so-called quantum 6j symbols and the quantum 6j symbols themselves have a natural

891
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:50,880
representation in three dimensions in terms of these path integrals which again is related to

892
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:56,000
the essential properties and is another side of what i mentioned earlier when i noticed that we

893
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
were getting the kinesian exam logic of the question which one knows is related to uh

894
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:11,760
quantum groups so different ways of looking at this make different aspects of driving quantum

895
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,680
groups from quantum filter you see i might remark that to physicists quantum groups are

896
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,400
rather funny things because you might say that the name quantum makes it sound like physics

897
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:29,280
and perhaps it does but what quantum is here being used in a rather loose sense quantum means

898
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:34,800
that an algebra in this sense context quantum is being used to mean that an algebra which

899
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:39,840
is commutative or commutative is being deformed so that it doesn't have those properties anyway

900
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:45,840
but quantum mechanics is really a little bit more specific than just deforming commutative

901
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,640
algebras to non-commutative algebras quantum mechanics really has to do with quantization

902
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:58,720
of symplectic manifolds the algebra which is being deformed is the uh algebra of functions

903
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:04,000
on a symplectic manifold and it's deformed to a non-commuting algebra of operators on Hilbert's

904
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:14,880
base quantum groups as formulated so elegantly uh involve the deformations of a cross on

905
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:22,160
manifold but not of a symplectic manifold and as such there really a bit outside the

906
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:31,760
conventional framework for quantum mechanics and quantum theory if you wish to uh take the

907
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,960
quantum group and reduce it to a more standard object which is quantization of symplectic

908
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:43,120
manifolds or once a complex structure is picked algebraic geometry sections of line bundles

909
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:49,920
over that modular space m sub j this much bigger story with the space of connections and the three

910
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:57,680
dimensional quantum theory puts the quantum group in a framework that really is quantum mechanics

911
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:05,280
and quantum theory of course the drawback is that we're in a much bigger picture which is

912
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:11,360
less obviously computable as so often happens in mathematics and physics the more computable version

913
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:16,400
which is the quantum group doesn't exhibit all the symmetries which are exhibited in the three

914
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:22,960
dimensional story one should think of this as one of many instances where there is a invariant

915
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:28,320
definition which is the definition involving quantum theory on three manifolds and there's a

916
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:32,960
computable definition a manifestly computable definition that doesn't manifestly have all

917
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:39,440
the symmetries which is the one that involves the reduction to quantum groups and the combinatorial

918
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:48,480
approaches now i think i should spend the last few minutes to give you a favor of what path

919
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:53,440
integrals are on here i shall be following as i should have said at the beginning in the first

920
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:59,680
steps of albert schwarz who considered the abelian version of this theory many years ago in the 70s

921
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:08,400
writing it to write a monster racing retortion so i want to say something which is mathematically

922
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:13,520
precise about path integrals though it doesn't give the complete story and it's a challenge to give

923
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:24,160
the complete story so what i'll tell you is if you give a physicist satan seeing a quantum theory

924
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:30,000
that was found behind a bush and has no particular redeeming virtues i will tell you all that can

925
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,760
be said about it that that path integrals based on general ideas so the only general thing that you

926
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:44,800
can say in terms of really computing their money so of course even if you've reduced an integral

927
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,360
to quadrature and finite dimensions you usually can't compute it and you look for some asymptotic

928
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:55,040
expansions and we will make an asymptotic expansion here which is an expansion in powers of 1 over k

929
01:43:56,640 --> 01:44:00,640
so the situation we're in is we have a big infinite dimensional manifold

930
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:05,680
and we're integrating something and the same thing we're integrating is the exponential of i times

931
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:13,600
something else times k so the prototype for this problem um i'm going to simplify it so

932
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,720
we really have the gauge group and we should worry about the ghosts the idea of proper of ghosts

933
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:22,640
but pretending they weren't there the prototype is a finite dimensional manifold

934
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:27,760
what they measure and a morse function it doesn't have to be a morse function in general it's a

935
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,200
larger class of functions but let's think for simplicity of a smooth function with isolated

936
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:39,200
critical points and then we have a real number and then we want to compute this integral and

937
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:43,920
of course we can't compute it in closed form we can prove it exists but we can't compute it

938
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,680
but we can't compute it in an asymptotic expansion in powers of 1 over 2 and that's

939
01:44:49,680 --> 01:44:55,360
essentially classical the asymptotics of such an integral is given by stationary phase

940
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:04,560
in fact if f were not a function but were had values in r mod 2 pi z and t was an integer

941
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:10,080
so there were no critical points this would vanish exponentially for large t because of oscillations

942
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:15,520
so the failure to vanish exponentially due to oscillations comes because of critical

943
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:20,160
points where there aren't oscillations the asymptotics are given by stationary phase

944
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:27,200
if pi are the critical points then this has a systematic expansion involving a sum over

945
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:32,720
critical points where the leading term is the value of the integrand at the earth critical

946
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:40,000
points times a power of t that depends on the dimension and then multiplied by a local expansion

947
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:50,080
determined by local data at the critical points so these are the coefficients here are local

948
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:56,400
invariants at the i-th critical point and for instance if near a given critical point you

949
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:02,720
make an expansion so i pick some local coordinates and i want them to be adapted to the measure

950
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:10,720
so that d mu is dx1 up to dxn and then since it's a critical point the function has its value

951
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,840
and then the next term is a quadratic term involving the so-called Hessian

952
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:20,480
then by studying the integral the idealized integral we find that the leading term

953
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:26,400
is this animal and that animal involves the determinant of the Hessian while this thing

954
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:33,440
has a determinant because of the existence of a measure here and the condition on the coordinates

955
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:38,640
involves the determinant of the Hessian and involves the signature of that quadratic form

956
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:47,440
so the leading contribution here involves these nice endurance of the behavior near the critical

957
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:53,120
point and then you can compute the higher order corrections involving local behavior near the

958
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:57,200
critical points you need to the only new thing you'll really need is that you'll need to invert

959
01:46:57,200 --> 01:47:03,440
this invertible matrix and then the expansion can be described diagrammatically in terms of what

960
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:16,400
physicists call Feynman diagrams now this can be imitated systematically in our problem in

961
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:21,840
fact that's where they're called Feynman diagrams well there's no problem with the notion of a

962
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:27,440
critical point uh for explain that a critical point of this functional is a fault connection

963
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:34,400
up to gauge transformation and for a large class of three manifolds they'll be isolated

964
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:40,080
in general we need to understand how to generalize the previous story which will involve certain

965
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:46,960
integrals of measures that you'll construct well what will happen in fact is that if the critical

966
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:53,840
point isn't isolated this determinant isn't a number but is naturally a measure on the space

967
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,920
of critical points so after proper understanding the finite dimensional story you can imitate it

968
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:05,600
here there's no problem with the notion of a critical point there's of course no problem

969
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,960
with the notion of the value of deterrence hymens functional at a critical point that's one of

970
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:16,960
these standard invariance of a fault connection well the hashen makes sense after including

971
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:23,360
the ghosts the hashen is a certain elliptic differential operator which i call al well

972
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:31,120
then we need the determinant of l but that's essentially what ray and singer defines and

973
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:36,800
schwarz interpreted in quantum field theory so that the determinant of l is the ray-singer

974
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:43,520
torsion and then we also need the signature of l well l is a quadratic form in infinite dimensions

975
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:52,480
so it has infinitely many positive and negative eigenvalues so we need to define its signature

976
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:58,160
and we need to regularize that but tia petode and singer told us how to do that in the so-called

977
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:02,800
eta invariant and in this problem the eta invariant is the right notion of the signature of l

978
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:11,840
so i've explained the leading contribution for large k to this path integral so we've actually

979
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:18,000
if you like evaluated the path integral in the leading approximation of stationary phase and

980
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,000
it involves invariants that are classical namely the more recent of them were defined in the early

981
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,600
70s but they're still fairly sophisticated things like the torsion and the eta invariant

982
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:36,000
and the corrections which are only beginning to be systematically investigated mathematically

983
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:39,760
involve what physicists call Feynman diagrams

984
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:50,160
um my student drill born out on has worked at rather precisely the through loop

985
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,600
correction to the not invariants and has shown that it's

986
01:49:54,880 --> 01:50:00,400
equal to the again classical not invariants which is the derivative of the jones polynomial

987
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:05,280
at q equals one as was the second derivative right as was expected

988
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:15,360
so then the story is that we can carry out the Hamiltonian picture more or less rigorously

989
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:21,680
getting the jones representations and their generalizations the deeper side of the story

990
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:30,480
is certainly the Hamiltonian picture which is a challenge perhaps to understand it comprehensively

991
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:37,520
um in perturbation theory it leads in the leading approximation to these classical but

992
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:42,880
slightly settled invariants with a systematic prescription for generalizing them and computing

993
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:47,760
more elaborate corrections perhaps rather as in some fashion which

994
01:50:48,320 --> 01:51:00,160
um in some perhaps rather fashion in the province primarily of experts

995
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:04,560
I certainly couldn't claim to grasp it a block explained in the first lecture

996
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,800
some generalizations of more classical invariants

997
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:11,840
thank you

998
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:28,240
yes thank you very much professor britain and the the inform of seminar is finished thank you for

999
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:39,280
attention

1000
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:51,280
thank you

1001
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,280
thank you

1002
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:07,280
what is it

1003
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:58,080
Now, the professor, Fatih Er, will speak on the work of Week 10.

1004
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:11,440
It's a duty of the chairman of the field committee to ask speakers for that session.

1005
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:21,280
So as soon as it becomes clear that Witten got a medal, I approached Tatia asking to speak for him.

1006
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:29,520
I wanted kind of cover up from a mathematician in the very physical domain

1007
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:37,360
to explain to you why it was so natural to give a field medal to a mathematical physicist.

1008
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:46,400
And Tatia was very enthusiastic in this, but he told me that unfortunately he cannot come

1009
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:54,800
to Kyoto in the end of August. So we decided on the following way that he will send me some text

1010
01:53:54,800 --> 01:54:04,720
and I will use it in describing of Witten work at this session. So I had got this text

1011
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:12,240
and I will read you some excerpts out of it, but it contains no formulas at all. So just to read it

1012
01:54:12,240 --> 01:54:16,080
maybe it will be a little bit too dull. You have seen transparencies before.

1013
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:26,880
So in a way it will be a mixture of ideas, text and some general comments which I will give to you

1014
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:35,520
myself and some explanations. So mathematical physics must be considered as a legitimate,

1015
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:44,160
it's my belief, must be considered as a legitimate part of mathematics. It was always stimulating,

1016
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:52,480
it was always a source of stimulus and inspiration for more theoretical branches of mathematics

1017
01:54:52,480 --> 01:55:00,160
and we know very many classical examples. But until recent time it was stimulating mostly

1018
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:07,760
analysis or in general or part of analysis such like partial differential equations,

1019
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:15,200
especially non-linear equations nowadays and so on and so forth. We could call it classical

1020
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:25,280
mathematical physics, but in more recent time we witnessed development, another type of mathematical

1021
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:31,600
physics which could be in contradiction with previous one called quantum mathematical physics.

1022
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:40,800
And this mathematical physics differs mainly, also differs from classical mathematical physics

1023
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:50,400
in the use of different domains of mathematics in it or in other words also stimulating different

1024
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:59,440
parts of theoretical mathematics. Algebra, geometry, topology, algebraic geometry, complex analysis,

1025
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:07,200
all these traditional fields of mathematics now come to modern mathematical physics and vice versa

1026
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:16,000
mathematical physics problems arising there in quantum mathematical physics are sources of new

1027
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:25,840
problems for this part of theoretical mathematics. And now I read first citation from Atiyah in all

1028
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:32,320
this large and exciting field which involves many of leading physicists and mathematicians in the

1029
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:38,880
world. Edward Whitten stands out clearly as the most influential and dominating figure,

1030
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:46,880
although he is definitely a physicist, here I would add mathematical physicist. His command

1031
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:54,240
of mathematics is rivaled by few mathematicians and his ability to interpret physical ideas

1032
01:56:54,960 --> 01:57:01,360
in mathematical form is quite unique. Time and again he has surprised the mathematical community

1033
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:07,440
by brilliant application of physical insight leading to new and deep mathematical theorems.

1034
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:19,680
Now in Atiyah's text there is elaboration on this general statement and usually the reference

1035
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:27,280
is to an important tool of modern theoretical mathematical physics which is called Feynman

1036
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:36,720
integral. Feynman integral allows us to write down explicit in quotation marks solution of very

1037
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:44,320
complicated problems arising in quantum field theory, quantum mechanics and so on. Quotation

1038
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:54,160
marks means that this tool is still heuristic and not not made rigorous, rigorous to the standards

1039
01:57:54,160 --> 01:58:04,160
which are supposed to be used now. They would certainly satisfy I would think more mathematicians

1040
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:11,920
in previous century but or even such people like Elikartan but without more standard of

1041
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:18,160
more high standards of rigor they are still non-rigors of course. On the other hand as I will

1042
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:28,480
try to explain with the help of Atiyah also it's really a very important tool to find out new mathematical

1043
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:44,480
theorems. So the ingredient in the Feynman integral is a functional of some fields. Fields means

1044
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:52,880
functions on the some manifold domain so functions could be not necessarily functions but sections

1045
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:59,200
of the bundle and so on so could have geometrical origin and this functional is called action

1046
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:08,480
and that function x to the i where i squared minus y times action is Feynman functional and the

1047
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:22,480
Feynman integral is kind of averaging over of this functional over all possible fields

1048
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:29,280
in consideration. It's significant value that is real over measure of course not measure is strict

1049
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:38,320
standards. This local which is a product over all points in the domain or manifold

1050
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:50,800
of differentials of these fields so to say. So the answer is a number that of course depending

1051
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,960
on what we what problem we have in consideration for instance we have domain the boundary or we have

1052
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:05,600
some asymptotical conditions then so there are some which characterize the the main

1053
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:12,800
of this geometrical object we are average over the function would be also functional of this data

1054
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:22,320
and so quite a rich object. So the example well of course physicists after Feynman after 48

1055
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:30,960
use it mostly for their own needs and then a function a was action in the statistical theory

1056
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:39,440
of mechanics of some particular Hamiltonian system but in more general use which gradually

1057
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:47,280
developed in this quantum mathematical physics and especially by the influence of very modern

1058
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:53,440
things there in particular what's called thing theory people began to use more

1059
02:00:53,920 --> 02:01:01,360
geometrical objects in these actions and fields. So examples of possible fields could be loops

1060
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:10,400
or connections it's called young wheels field in physics or metrics in physics it would be

1061
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:19,360
most useful in the case of gravity and so on and so forth. So Witten have shown a very

1062
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:31,200
ingenious way of using functionally integral to produce purely mathematical theorems.

1063
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:45,840
Now I cite from here in his paper on supersymmetry and Morse theory yes excuse me Witten's paper on

1064
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:51,360
supersymmetry and Morse theory is obligatory reading for geometers interested in understanding

1065
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:56,960
modern quantum field theory. It also contains a brilliant proof of classical Morse inequalities

1066
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:03,200
relating critical points to homology. The main point is that homology is defined

1067
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:11,760
via Hodge harmonic forms so the Laplacian will play a role of the Schrodinger operator

1068
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:20,000
of quantum mechanics and you can write down Feynman integral using this action.
