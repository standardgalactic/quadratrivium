00:00.000 --> 00:10.760
Not only are they tackling the most mechanically intricate medieval weapon ever made, they

00:10.760 --> 00:18.040
have to stick it all together with nothing but their all-time favorite material.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.560
But first, Adam puts the tape aside to work out how one works.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.600
Alright, I think we have enough built now to talk about the component pieces of a trebuchet

00:27.600 --> 00:28.600
and how they work.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.360
Graphics, can you help me out?

00:30.360 --> 00:37.000
The main parts are the stand, the swing arm, and the fulcrum, the swing arm, pivots on.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.320
Now the swing arm has a weight at one end and a sling at the other, and here are some

00:42.320 --> 00:43.320
important relationships.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.240
There's a relationship between the long part of the swing arm and the short part.

00:47.240 --> 00:53.400
That's 3.75 to 1, and the sling wants to be exactly the length of the long part of the

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
swing arm.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.880
To get all that right, apparently this thing throws farther than just about any other medieval

00:58.880 --> 01:00.920
weapon of the war.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.440
The real long shot will be getting a full-size trebuchet to work with only duct tape to hold

01:06.440 --> 01:07.440
it together.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.960
So, the weight here is the sole of the trebuchet.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.160
The gravitational pull of this weight down causes the whole mechanism to work.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.400
In the toughest duct tape task the team has ever tackled, that counterweight will eventually

01:22.400 --> 01:29.720
weigh 750 pounds, and exert more than 3,000 foot-pounds of torque.

01:29.720 --> 01:36.640
That's a fully loaded trebuchet right there, let's see what happens.

01:36.640 --> 01:41.600
I'll flung it into the ground.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.320
That's not ideal, that's not ideal at all.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.160
I love making these demonstration models.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.360
I had the ceiling clearly somewhere in the middle of this, Michael.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.560
It's often some of the most fun that I have on the show.

01:56.560 --> 02:00.200
I think I made too much of a cup.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.560
There is nothing better than being able to lay your hands on something, even if you're

02:04.560 --> 02:06.800
going to build it 10 times as large.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.800
I didn't let go.

02:08.800 --> 02:09.800
Why didn't it let go?

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
What the hell?

02:10.800 --> 02:15.600
Slightly bigger nut, much bigger nut.

02:15.600 --> 02:25.120
After several hours of hands-on tinkering, Adam has the mechanics nailed, and successfully

02:25.120 --> 02:29.560
launches his model.

02:29.560 --> 02:29.840
Wow.
