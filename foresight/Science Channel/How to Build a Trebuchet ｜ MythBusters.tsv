0	10760	Not only are they tackling the most mechanically intricate medieval weapon ever made, they
10760	18040	have to stick it all together with nothing but their all-time favorite material.
18040	22560	But first, Adam puts the tape aside to work out how one works.
22560	27600	Alright, I think we have enough built now to talk about the component pieces of a trebuchet
27600	28600	and how they work.
28600	30360	Graphics, can you help me out?
30360	37000	The main parts are the stand, the swing arm, and the fulcrum, the swing arm, pivots on.
37000	42320	Now the swing arm has a weight at one end and a sling at the other, and here are some
42320	43320	important relationships.
43320	47240	There's a relationship between the long part of the swing arm and the short part.
47240	53400	That's 3.75 to 1, and the sling wants to be exactly the length of the long part of the
53400	54400	swing arm.
54400	58880	To get all that right, apparently this thing throws farther than just about any other medieval
58880	60920	weapon of the war.
60920	66440	The real long shot will be getting a full-size trebuchet to work with only duct tape to hold
66440	67440	it together.
67440	70960	So, the weight here is the sole of the trebuchet.
70960	77160	The gravitational pull of this weight down causes the whole mechanism to work.
77160	82400	In the toughest duct tape task the team has ever tackled, that counterweight will eventually
82400	89720	weigh 750 pounds, and exert more than 3,000 foot-pounds of torque.
89720	96640	That's a fully loaded trebuchet right there, let's see what happens.
96640	101600	I'll flung it into the ground.
101600	105320	That's not ideal, that's not ideal at all.
105320	108160	I love making these demonstration models.
108160	113360	I had the ceiling clearly somewhere in the middle of this, Michael.
113360	116560	It's often some of the most fun that I have on the show.
116560	120200	I think I made too much of a cup.
120200	124560	There is nothing better than being able to lay your hands on something, even if you're
124560	126800	going to build it 10 times as large.
126800	128800	I didn't let go.
128800	129800	Why didn't it let go?
129800	130800	What the hell?
130800	135600	Slightly bigger nut, much bigger nut.
135600	145120	After several hours of hands-on tinkering, Adam has the mechanics nailed, and successfully
145120	149560	launches his model.
149560	149840	Wow.
