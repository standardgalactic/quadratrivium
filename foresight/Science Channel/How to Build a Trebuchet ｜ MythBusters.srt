1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Not only are they tackling the most mechanically intricate medieval weapon ever made, they

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:18,040
have to stick it all together with nothing but their all-time favorite material.

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,560
But first, Adam puts the tape aside to work out how one works.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,600
Alright, I think we have enough built now to talk about the component pieces of a trebuchet

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,600
and how they work.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,360
Graphics, can you help me out?

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:37,000
The main parts are the stand, the swing arm, and the fulcrum, the swing arm, pivots on.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Now the swing arm has a weight at one end and a sling at the other, and here are some

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,320
important relationships.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,240
There's a relationship between the long part of the swing arm and the short part.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:53,400
That's 3.75 to 1, and the sling wants to be exactly the length of the long part of the

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
swing arm.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,880
To get all that right, apparently this thing throws farther than just about any other medieval

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,920
weapon of the war.

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,440
The real long shot will be getting a full-size trebuchet to work with only duct tape to hold

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
it together.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,960
So, the weight here is the sole of the trebuchet.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,160
The gravitational pull of this weight down causes the whole mechanism to work.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,400
In the toughest duct tape task the team has ever tackled, that counterweight will eventually

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,720
weigh 750 pounds, and exert more than 3,000 foot-pounds of torque.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,640
That's a fully loaded trebuchet right there, let's see what happens.

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,600
I'll flung it into the ground.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,320
That's not ideal, that's not ideal at all.

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,160
I love making these demonstration models.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,360
I had the ceiling clearly somewhere in the middle of this, Michael.

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,560
It's often some of the most fun that I have on the show.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,200
I think I made too much of a cup.

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,560
There is nothing better than being able to lay your hands on something, even if you're

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,800
going to build it 10 times as large.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I didn't let go.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,800
Why didn't it let go?

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,800
What the hell?

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Slightly bigger nut, much bigger nut.

34
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:25,120
After several hours of hands-on tinkering, Adam has the mechanics nailed, and successfully

35
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,560
launches his model.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,840
Wow.
