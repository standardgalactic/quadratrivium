0	4960	Hey guys, it's Sasha. The world is obsessed with AI. Every company is busy telling its
4960	10640	shareholders that they are now not a retail company, not a software company, not a car company,
10640	16960	not a social media company. No, they are all now artificial intelligence companies.
16960	21600	And you can't blame them. Since the start of 2022, the stock market has had one of the worst
21600	29200	crashes in history. Stocks fell 25% in 2022 and have not recovered since then. But at the same
29200	34480	time, the S&P 500 is at an all-time high. And this is because in the last 18 months,
34480	41440	since chatGPT arrived, the small number of AI stocks have absolutely exploded in value,
41440	46800	which has covered up what's actually happening out there to the rest of the stock market.
46800	53520	The race for being the leader in AI is so hot that there is now huge pressure on companies to
53520	59440	release AI products, on companies to call things AI, where maybe they're not quite AI,
59440	65360	or not at all AI, not because they actually make things better for users if they use AI in many
65360	71840	cases, but because if you have a high enough density of using the word AI in your quarterly
71840	77520	earnings call, your share price automatically increases by 300%. And the problem is that a
77520	84800	lot of these big companies are now so far up their own backside, they are faking their AI,
84800	91440	because they need to put out something that looks like AI, that they can sell as AI, but they
91440	98160	haven't actually figured out how to make that AI work yet. They haven't actually made it work,
98160	105200	so let's pretend. So yesterday, the information published a story leaked by an Amazon insider.
105200	109600	In the last two years or so, Amazon have released their Just Walk Out technology in some of their
109600	115440	shops. The idea is that you can just walk in and Amazon developed this AI that automatically checks
115440	119680	what it is that you put in your basket through cameras and sensors in the shop, and you don't
119680	124160	have to queue up or to check out, you don't have to pay for it, you just walk out of the store
124160	128720	with the stuff that you've picked up, and you will get billed automatically afterwards. Now,
128720	133600	I tried this a few times, although the prices in these shops are so high, it doesn't make any sense,
133600	138720	and I only really did it for novelty value, but the weird thing is that when you go and do the
138720	143440	shop, you don't get an immediate notification when you come out saying, you know, hey Sasha,
143440	148000	thanks for shopping with Amazon, here is your itemised bill, we've charged your credit card $25,
148000	154720	no, it takes several hours for that to happen. And I thought that was a bit strange, because if
154720	162640	it's automatic, if it's driven by AI, why does it take several hours for the automatic life system
162640	168960	to send you the bill? Well, it now turns out that this AI was actually 1,000 people sitting in a
168960	175600	room somewhere in India, watching the cameras from the shops and manually adjusting your basket.
175600	182080	According to this whistleblower, 70% of all transactions in these shops were processed
182080	186960	manually via this team in India, I guess anything other than you may be picking up one item for
186960	192480	the novelty value, and then walking straight out becomes too complicated for this AI to actually
192480	197520	process. Amazon quickly tried to perform damage limitation, and Amazon spokesman came out and
197520	202000	said that associates may validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision
202000	206560	technology cannot determine with complete confidence and the individual's purchases.
206560	212160	Amazon went and quickly deleted a bunch of pages which described this AI when they first launched
212160	218160	the product. According to Amazon, this story is completely untrue, and the system works great,
218240	223840	and their associates in India are really just there to help train the AI system, which is working
223840	230640	just fine, which is why two days ago, just before, immediately before that new story broke, because
230640	236000	Amazon knew it was coming, they announced that they are cancelling the just walkout system in their
236000	243280	stores, the one that's working really great, and they are replacing it with shopping trolleys.
243280	249200	But Amazon is not the only big company that is actively faking AI. Back in December,
249200	254080	Google announced Gemini, because I guess even the execs at Google realized that even though
254080	259920	their personal butler at home is called Bard, it is in fact actually a pretty bad name for an AI tool.
259920	265360	So in December, Google published this video where they showcased the capability of Gemini.
265360	271440	They would show Gemini things, ask Gemini things, and it would respond, except it came out sometime
271440	277280	after that video was published, that the entire thing was faked. The interaction was faked,
277280	283280	the video was faked, the responses were manually fed through to the AI engine, submitting some
283280	289680	hyper specific still images, not what was in the video, until the AI just happened to give
289680	295520	the right answer, and then they put all those right answers together, did a voiceover of the
295520	300960	answers to pretend that it worked seamlessly as it did in the video. It's not the first time Google
300960	307120	faked an AI demo. Back in 2018, Sunda Pichai demonstrated an AI system called Duplex.
307120	313200	By the way, what is it with a reference to the number two? Duplex, Gemini, anyway. In 2018,
313200	318320	Google demonstrated that this new AI assistant can do things like phone a restaurant on your
318320	322720	behalf to make you a reservation, so you don't have to. I'm looking for something on May 3rd,
322880	336000	and naturally, people asked a lot of questions, people were intrigued, and Google ignored all
336000	342080	those questions. The most obvious question was, was that demonstration completely faking fake?
342080	347200	Because it sure looked like a complete fake in the video, and well, six years later,
347200	352560	that assistant still doesn't exist. So you can decide for yourself whether that was another
352560	357840	completely fabricated bit of AI, but it doesn't stop there. You know the mysterious Google
357840	363360	algorithm, the almighty powerful algorithm that decides which websites get shown for which results?
363360	367840	Well, Google has long been saying how advanced their ranking system is, you know, how results are
367840	373680	automatically generated. This whole thing is being operated by extremely sophisticated AI.
373680	377280	There is a whole page rank system behind the scenes that automatically determines if your
377280	383280	content is helpful, and there is no human element to it whatsoever to prevent bias, right? Well,
383280	389120	it just so happens that Google employs 16,000 people called quality raters. There is a whole
389120	394720	giant training document for these people, here it is, it's 170 pages long, and these people spend
394720	400560	all day every day manually assessing the websites, you know, the websites that are ranked by this
400560	405520	really amazing AI. For example, they're meant to try and check if the content creator lacks adequate
405520	410960	experience, lacks adequate expertise, if the content creator is not an authoritative or
410960	417200	trustworthy source. And by the way, your website gets the lowest possible score if the website
417200	423840	terms of use states that some articles are generated by artificial intelligence and may have errors
423840	428640	or be out of date, which of course makes perfect sense because instead of showing these rubbish
428640	435120	websites, Google now shows you answers generated by artificial intelligence that often have errors
435120	440720	and the information is out of date, talking of which the most talked about AI that exists today
440720	447520	is chat GPT by open AI. It is like the holy grail. And of course, Bing, Microsoft search engine,
447520	453600	uses open AI in their results. And you know the spiel you told that these are highly sophisticated,
453600	460400	highly complex systems that learn on data that you feed into it. And then it becomes incredibly
460400	466880	intelligent. You see, learning on other people's data is not stealing. It is not copyright theft.
466880	472880	It is far more advanced than that. You just don't get it. It's a bit like how artists learn by looking
472880	479920	at other artists, they grow up. And to be honest, these AI models are just so complicated that none
479920	486480	of us with our small brains can possibly understand or compute how clever they are because they do
486560	492720	not. Do not scrape the internet and then just spit out that same content. No, no, no, no, no.
492720	498480	I went and asked Bing to tell me what the best road trips from Las Vegas are. And it said,
498480	503920	certainly, if you're in Las Vegas and looking for exciting road trips, here are some fantastic
503920	510000	options. One, Nelson Goes Town and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Interesting choice at number one.
510000	515680	It's funny because there is this article here written by some guy called Sasha called 21
515760	520960	best road trips from Las Vegas. And you know what? It's not the best article out there.
520960	526480	But wouldn't you know it? And the number one spot in this article is also Nelson Goes Town
526480	533440	and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Word for word. How strange. How far is it? Well, it's exactly 45
533440	538720	minutes and 45 miles from Las Vegas, which is interesting because that's a very precise number
538720	545200	of minutes. But you know, probably just a coincidence. So just outside Las Vegas, you'll find the
545200	550640	Ghost Town of Nelson. There's half rusted old cars, you know, an interesting phrase to use.
550640	556800	It's a very unusual way of putting that. Then there's rattlesnakes in a freezer. Hmm. According
556800	562240	to Google, there is literally only one results on the internet that uses this exact phrase.
562880	567600	And I guess rattlesnakes should be spelled as one word. I guess I made a mistake. Well, never mind.
567600	572720	Bing also spelt it as two words. Such a coincidence is crazy. So then there's even
572720	578720	crashed airplanes. Take care when exploring, though, because rattlesnakes are common. Tours
578720	585600	of the gold mine run at 9am, 12pm and 2pm, taking you through Nevada's richest mine that operated
585600	590480	for nearly 80 years. And you know what? I just checked their website and it's funny because I
590480	598720	actually got that last bit wrong. The mine ran from 1861 until 1942. So it was actually a bit
598720	605200	more than 80 years. Isn't it such a coincidence that Bing made the same exact mistake using
605200	611040	the same exact words? Anyway, number two on their list is the Valley of Fire State Park.
611040	616400	And it's 50 minutes and 49 miles from Las Vegas. Very precise. Although strangely,
616400	622160	if you look it up on Bing Maps, you know, the Bing map service, that says 53 miles because I
622160	628080	guess Bing Maps is measuring to the middle of the park. Where do they get the 49 miles from?
628080	634480	How strange. Anyway, you get the point. This AI is just plain stealing content from other websites.
634480	639200	Slightly changing some of the words and showing that instead of showing the website from which
639200	644320	the information was stolen. Just because this information is processed and stored in a neural
644320	652480	net does not somehow make it immune from general laws about theft. This AI is what is known in
652480	657040	the industry as an automated content spinner. You might have noticed in the last six months
657120	661840	that a huge number of smaller medium sized websites have stopped being shown on Google.
661840	666720	They're disappearing. These websites are going bankrupt because they're getting no traffic now.
666720	671120	Now when you search something, you get an AI answer from the search engine, which basically
671120	676400	has stolen the content of those small websites that they no longer show. Then you get a 15 year
676400	680880	old Reddit post at the top. This of course has nothing to do with Google signing a commercial
680880	686160	deal with Reddit to use Reddit data for their AI training. It has nothing to do with Reddit traffic
686160	692000	randomly growing by over 500% in the last few months for no apparent reason whatsoever
692000	697200	because Google is now sending them all of the traffic that they used to send to the small
697200	704400	websites. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Reddit just went and did an IPO. Immediately
704400	710640	after their traffic exploded and the owner of Reddit sold a massive boatload of shares becoming
710720	717120	incredibly rich after the company was valued based on the fact that their traffic is now
717120	723600	500% higher than it was a year ago. This of course is all a complete coincidence. The fact is
724240	731280	there are a lot of people making a lot of money from this AI hype wave. Not in the sense of
731280	737120	earning revenue and making profits because no, AI is a loss making in most cases at the moment.
737120	742400	But in the sense of the price of company shares, a lot of companies including the very biggest
742400	747840	companies in the world are now so balls deep in their commitment to AI because it's all smoke
747840	752080	mirrors and pretend games that they have to lie, they have to break the law and they have to create
752080	757520	fake AI to keep their stock price high. Making false statements as a publicly traded company
757520	764320	about your AI capabilities is not punished. The SEC does not seem to give a shit that these
764320	771680	companies are openly brazenly lying about their products to their customers, about their developments
771680	777120	and new releases to their investors. It's AI bro, it's the future, it's pushing the boundaries
777120	782800	and the result? Well, other than the stock price going up on a vertical line, the real life experience
782800	787280	of people in many cases is getting worse. Remember when you could actually find useful
787280	791840	information on Google? Well now you have an AI generated answer, followed by some shopping
791840	797920	results followed by four ad slots before you see the first actual result. You now often have to scroll
797920	803600	quite far down just to see the first result and that actual first result is going to be a Reddit
803600	808400	post from 15 years ago. Remember when you could actually call up a company if you had a problem
808400	813440	and there would be a human, a person at the other end who would actually, I don't know, help you
813440	818880	with your problem? Well, now that person has been fired so that the company can have less cost and
819280	825360	make more profits and instead you have the AI chatbot which apparently is what everybody wants
825360	831040	because I don't know about you but every single time I speak to one of these chatbots I immediately
831040	837600	get the perfect resolution to all of my problems and I do not sit there staring at the fucking screen
837600	844320	spitting and fuming in rage when the AI chatbot gives me yet another generic answer, sends me to the
844320	850960	FAQs or asks me to rephrase the question. It's indisputable that in the long run AI is going to
850960	856240	fundamentally improve our lives. It's here to stay, it's going to do great things. When AI can
856240	860960	drive your car for you, when AI can take over the boring chores and do the shit that you don't want
860960	866240	to do or when AI can automate the jobs that people would prefer not doing but at the moment
866800	872320	companies are a million miles from there, they're just using the hype for personal advantage,
872320	878320	they're busy faking AI and then promoting that fake AI to boost their share price because who
878320	884800	cares about the fact that your product is actually worse? Who cares if that AI is actually unprofitable?
884800	890000	Who cares that you piss off your customers and ruin your product? Remember you are a monopoly,
890000	896800	it doesn't matter, it's AI bro and AI means that your stock just keeps on going up to the moon.
