Checking Sasha Yanshin/Big Tech Is Faking AI.txt
 The discussion here revolves around the issues arising from the overhyped and often misused application of artificial intelligence (AI) in various sectors, particularly in online content generation and customer service. The argument is that AI, while promising and potentially beneficial for society in the long run, is currently being exploited by large corporations to boost stock prices and profits, often at the expense of smaller businesses and consumer experience.

The narrative points out that:

1. Small and medium-sized websites are losing traffic and visibility as search engines like Google now favor AI-generated content over human-created content, leading to a decline in these sites' viability and revenue.

2. Reddit, which has seen a significant increase in traffic (over 500%), is benefiting from the surge in visits redirected from small websites by Google, likely due to a commercial agreement where Reddit's content is used to train Google's AI. This coincides with Reddit's recent Initial Public Offering (IPO), which has significantly increased the wealth of its owner.

3. Companies are over-promising on their AI capabilities to investors and customers, often making false claims about what their AI can do because there is a market perception that AI is revolutionary and indispensable.

4. The regulatory body responsible for financial oversight, the SEC, seems to turn a blind eye to these deceptive practices.

5. In practice, the integration of AI has led to negative consequences such as reduced accessibility of useful information, job losses due to automation, and ineffective customer service chatbots that often fail to resolve issues.

6. Despite these issues, the hype around AI continues to drive stock prices up, as companies capitalize on the perceived innovation without concern for the real-world application or profitability of their AI solutions.

The overarching message is a call for accountability and a realistic assessment of AI's role in society, emphasizing that while AI holds great potential for positive change, it should not be used to deceive or harm individuals and businesses.
