00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
Hey guys, it's Sasha. The world is obsessed with AI. Every company is busy telling its

00:04.960 --> 00:10.640
shareholders that they are now not a retail company, not a software company, not a car company,

00:10.640 --> 00:16.960
not a social media company. No, they are all now artificial intelligence companies.

00:16.960 --> 00:21.600
And you can't blame them. Since the start of 2022, the stock market has had one of the worst

00:21.600 --> 00:29.200
crashes in history. Stocks fell 25% in 2022 and have not recovered since then. But at the same

00:29.200 --> 00:34.480
time, the S&P 500 is at an all-time high. And this is because in the last 18 months,

00:34.480 --> 00:41.440
since chatGPT arrived, the small number of AI stocks have absolutely exploded in value,

00:41.440 --> 00:46.800
which has covered up what's actually happening out there to the rest of the stock market.

00:46.800 --> 00:53.520
The race for being the leader in AI is so hot that there is now huge pressure on companies to

00:53.520 --> 00:59.440
release AI products, on companies to call things AI, where maybe they're not quite AI,

00:59.440 --> 01:05.360
or not at all AI, not because they actually make things better for users if they use AI in many

01:05.360 --> 01:11.840
cases, but because if you have a high enough density of using the word AI in your quarterly

01:11.840 --> 01:17.520
earnings call, your share price automatically increases by 300%. And the problem is that a

01:17.520 --> 01:24.800
lot of these big companies are now so far up their own backside, they are faking their AI,

01:24.800 --> 01:31.440
because they need to put out something that looks like AI, that they can sell as AI, but they

01:31.440 --> 01:38.160
haven't actually figured out how to make that AI work yet. They haven't actually made it work,

01:38.160 --> 01:45.200
so let's pretend. So yesterday, the information published a story leaked by an Amazon insider.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.600
In the last two years or so, Amazon have released their Just Walk Out technology in some of their

01:49.600 --> 01:55.440
shops. The idea is that you can just walk in and Amazon developed this AI that automatically checks

01:55.440 --> 01:59.680
what it is that you put in your basket through cameras and sensors in the shop, and you don't

01:59.680 --> 02:04.160
have to queue up or to check out, you don't have to pay for it, you just walk out of the store

02:04.160 --> 02:08.720
with the stuff that you've picked up, and you will get billed automatically afterwards. Now,

02:08.720 --> 02:13.600
I tried this a few times, although the prices in these shops are so high, it doesn't make any sense,

02:13.600 --> 02:18.720
and I only really did it for novelty value, but the weird thing is that when you go and do the

02:18.720 --> 02:23.440
shop, you don't get an immediate notification when you come out saying, you know, hey Sasha,

02:23.440 --> 02:28.000
thanks for shopping with Amazon, here is your itemised bill, we've charged your credit card $25,

02:28.000 --> 02:34.720
no, it takes several hours for that to happen. And I thought that was a bit strange, because if

02:34.720 --> 02:42.640
it's automatic, if it's driven by AI, why does it take several hours for the automatic life system

02:42.640 --> 02:48.960
to send you the bill? Well, it now turns out that this AI was actually 1,000 people sitting in a

02:48.960 --> 02:55.600
room somewhere in India, watching the cameras from the shops and manually adjusting your basket.

02:55.600 --> 03:02.080
According to this whistleblower, 70% of all transactions in these shops were processed

03:02.080 --> 03:06.960
manually via this team in India, I guess anything other than you may be picking up one item for

03:06.960 --> 03:12.480
the novelty value, and then walking straight out becomes too complicated for this AI to actually

03:12.480 --> 03:17.520
process. Amazon quickly tried to perform damage limitation, and Amazon spokesman came out and

03:17.520 --> 03:22.000
said that associates may validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision

03:22.000 --> 03:26.560
technology cannot determine with complete confidence and the individual's purchases.

03:26.560 --> 03:32.160
Amazon went and quickly deleted a bunch of pages which described this AI when they first launched

03:32.160 --> 03:38.160
the product. According to Amazon, this story is completely untrue, and the system works great,

03:38.240 --> 03:43.840
and their associates in India are really just there to help train the AI system, which is working

03:43.840 --> 03:50.640
just fine, which is why two days ago, just before, immediately before that new story broke, because

03:50.640 --> 03:56.000
Amazon knew it was coming, they announced that they are cancelling the just walkout system in their

03:56.000 --> 04:03.280
stores, the one that's working really great, and they are replacing it with shopping trolleys.

04:03.280 --> 04:09.200
But Amazon is not the only big company that is actively faking AI. Back in December,

04:09.200 --> 04:14.080
Google announced Gemini, because I guess even the execs at Google realized that even though

04:14.080 --> 04:19.920
their personal butler at home is called Bard, it is in fact actually a pretty bad name for an AI tool.

04:19.920 --> 04:25.360
So in December, Google published this video where they showcased the capability of Gemini.

04:25.360 --> 04:31.440
They would show Gemini things, ask Gemini things, and it would respond, except it came out sometime

04:31.440 --> 04:37.280
after that video was published, that the entire thing was faked. The interaction was faked,

04:37.280 --> 04:43.280
the video was faked, the responses were manually fed through to the AI engine, submitting some

04:43.280 --> 04:49.680
hyper specific still images, not what was in the video, until the AI just happened to give

04:49.680 --> 04:55.520
the right answer, and then they put all those right answers together, did a voiceover of the

04:55.520 --> 05:00.960
answers to pretend that it worked seamlessly as it did in the video. It's not the first time Google

05:00.960 --> 05:07.120
faked an AI demo. Back in 2018, Sunda Pichai demonstrated an AI system called Duplex.

05:07.120 --> 05:13.200
By the way, what is it with a reference to the number two? Duplex, Gemini, anyway. In 2018,

05:13.200 --> 05:18.320
Google demonstrated that this new AI assistant can do things like phone a restaurant on your

05:18.320 --> 05:22.720
behalf to make you a reservation, so you don't have to. I'm looking for something on May 3rd,

05:22.880 --> 05:36.000
and naturally, people asked a lot of questions, people were intrigued, and Google ignored all

05:36.000 --> 05:42.080
those questions. The most obvious question was, was that demonstration completely faking fake?

05:42.080 --> 05:47.200
Because it sure looked like a complete fake in the video, and well, six years later,

05:47.200 --> 05:52.560
that assistant still doesn't exist. So you can decide for yourself whether that was another

05:52.560 --> 05:57.840
completely fabricated bit of AI, but it doesn't stop there. You know the mysterious Google

05:57.840 --> 06:03.360
algorithm, the almighty powerful algorithm that decides which websites get shown for which results?

06:03.360 --> 06:07.840
Well, Google has long been saying how advanced their ranking system is, you know, how results are

06:07.840 --> 06:13.680
automatically generated. This whole thing is being operated by extremely sophisticated AI.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.280
There is a whole page rank system behind the scenes that automatically determines if your

06:17.280 --> 06:23.280
content is helpful, and there is no human element to it whatsoever to prevent bias, right? Well,

06:23.280 --> 06:29.120
it just so happens that Google employs 16,000 people called quality raters. There is a whole

06:29.120 --> 06:34.720
giant training document for these people, here it is, it's 170 pages long, and these people spend

06:34.720 --> 06:40.560
all day every day manually assessing the websites, you know, the websites that are ranked by this

06:40.560 --> 06:45.520
really amazing AI. For example, they're meant to try and check if the content creator lacks adequate

06:45.520 --> 06:50.960
experience, lacks adequate expertise, if the content creator is not an authoritative or

06:50.960 --> 06:57.200
trustworthy source. And by the way, your website gets the lowest possible score if the website

06:57.200 --> 07:03.840
terms of use states that some articles are generated by artificial intelligence and may have errors

07:03.840 --> 07:08.640
or be out of date, which of course makes perfect sense because instead of showing these rubbish

07:08.640 --> 07:15.120
websites, Google now shows you answers generated by artificial intelligence that often have errors

07:15.120 --> 07:20.720
and the information is out of date, talking of which the most talked about AI that exists today

07:20.720 --> 07:27.520
is chat GPT by open AI. It is like the holy grail. And of course, Bing, Microsoft search engine,

07:27.520 --> 07:33.600
uses open AI in their results. And you know the spiel you told that these are highly sophisticated,

07:33.600 --> 07:40.400
highly complex systems that learn on data that you feed into it. And then it becomes incredibly

07:40.400 --> 07:46.880
intelligent. You see, learning on other people's data is not stealing. It is not copyright theft.

07:46.880 --> 07:52.880
It is far more advanced than that. You just don't get it. It's a bit like how artists learn by looking

07:52.880 --> 07:59.920
at other artists, they grow up. And to be honest, these AI models are just so complicated that none

07:59.920 --> 08:06.480
of us with our small brains can possibly understand or compute how clever they are because they do

08:06.560 --> 08:12.720
not. Do not scrape the internet and then just spit out that same content. No, no, no, no, no.

08:12.720 --> 08:18.480
I went and asked Bing to tell me what the best road trips from Las Vegas are. And it said,

08:18.480 --> 08:23.920
certainly, if you're in Las Vegas and looking for exciting road trips, here are some fantastic

08:23.920 --> 08:30.000
options. One, Nelson Goes Town and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Interesting choice at number one.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.680
It's funny because there is this article here written by some guy called Sasha called 21

08:35.760 --> 08:40.960
best road trips from Las Vegas. And you know what? It's not the best article out there.

08:40.960 --> 08:46.480
But wouldn't you know it? And the number one spot in this article is also Nelson Goes Town

08:46.480 --> 08:53.440
and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Word for word. How strange. How far is it? Well, it's exactly 45

08:53.440 --> 08:58.720
minutes and 45 miles from Las Vegas, which is interesting because that's a very precise number

08:58.720 --> 09:05.200
of minutes. But you know, probably just a coincidence. So just outside Las Vegas, you'll find the

09:05.200 --> 09:10.640
Ghost Town of Nelson. There's half rusted old cars, you know, an interesting phrase to use.

09:10.640 --> 09:16.800
It's a very unusual way of putting that. Then there's rattlesnakes in a freezer. Hmm. According

09:16.800 --> 09:22.240
to Google, there is literally only one results on the internet that uses this exact phrase.

09:22.880 --> 09:27.600
And I guess rattlesnakes should be spelled as one word. I guess I made a mistake. Well, never mind.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.720
Bing also spelt it as two words. Such a coincidence is crazy. So then there's even

09:32.720 --> 09:38.720
crashed airplanes. Take care when exploring, though, because rattlesnakes are common. Tours

09:38.720 --> 09:45.600
of the gold mine run at 9am, 12pm and 2pm, taking you through Nevada's richest mine that operated

09:45.600 --> 09:50.480
for nearly 80 years. And you know what? I just checked their website and it's funny because I

09:50.480 --> 09:58.720
actually got that last bit wrong. The mine ran from 1861 until 1942. So it was actually a bit

09:58.720 --> 10:05.200
more than 80 years. Isn't it such a coincidence that Bing made the same exact mistake using

10:05.200 --> 10:11.040
the same exact words? Anyway, number two on their list is the Valley of Fire State Park.

10:11.040 --> 10:16.400
And it's 50 minutes and 49 miles from Las Vegas. Very precise. Although strangely,

10:16.400 --> 10:22.160
if you look it up on Bing Maps, you know, the Bing map service, that says 53 miles because I

10:22.160 --> 10:28.080
guess Bing Maps is measuring to the middle of the park. Where do they get the 49 miles from?

10:28.080 --> 10:34.480
How strange. Anyway, you get the point. This AI is just plain stealing content from other websites.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.200
Slightly changing some of the words and showing that instead of showing the website from which

10:39.200 --> 10:44.320
the information was stolen. Just because this information is processed and stored in a neural

10:44.320 --> 10:52.480
net does not somehow make it immune from general laws about theft. This AI is what is known in

10:52.480 --> 10:57.040
the industry as an automated content spinner. You might have noticed in the last six months

10:57.120 --> 11:01.840
that a huge number of smaller medium sized websites have stopped being shown on Google.

11:01.840 --> 11:06.720
They're disappearing. These websites are going bankrupt because they're getting no traffic now.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.120
Now when you search something, you get an AI answer from the search engine, which basically

11:11.120 --> 11:16.400
has stolen the content of those small websites that they no longer show. Then you get a 15 year

11:16.400 --> 11:20.880
old Reddit post at the top. This of course has nothing to do with Google signing a commercial

11:20.880 --> 11:26.160
deal with Reddit to use Reddit data for their AI training. It has nothing to do with Reddit traffic

11:26.160 --> 11:32.000
randomly growing by over 500% in the last few months for no apparent reason whatsoever

11:32.000 --> 11:37.200
because Google is now sending them all of the traffic that they used to send to the small

11:37.200 --> 11:44.400
websites. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Reddit just went and did an IPO. Immediately

11:44.400 --> 11:50.640
after their traffic exploded and the owner of Reddit sold a massive boatload of shares becoming

11:50.720 --> 11:57.120
incredibly rich after the company was valued based on the fact that their traffic is now

11:57.120 --> 12:03.600
500% higher than it was a year ago. This of course is all a complete coincidence. The fact is

12:04.240 --> 12:11.280
there are a lot of people making a lot of money from this AI hype wave. Not in the sense of

12:11.280 --> 12:17.120
earning revenue and making profits because no, AI is a loss making in most cases at the moment.

12:17.120 --> 12:22.400
But in the sense of the price of company shares, a lot of companies including the very biggest

12:22.400 --> 12:27.840
companies in the world are now so balls deep in their commitment to AI because it's all smoke

12:27.840 --> 12:32.080
mirrors and pretend games that they have to lie, they have to break the law and they have to create

12:32.080 --> 12:37.520
fake AI to keep their stock price high. Making false statements as a publicly traded company

12:37.520 --> 12:44.320
about your AI capabilities is not punished. The SEC does not seem to give a shit that these

12:44.320 --> 12:51.680
companies are openly brazenly lying about their products to their customers, about their developments

12:51.680 --> 12:57.120
and new releases to their investors. It's AI bro, it's the future, it's pushing the boundaries

12:57.120 --> 13:02.800
and the result? Well, other than the stock price going up on a vertical line, the real life experience

13:02.800 --> 13:07.280
of people in many cases is getting worse. Remember when you could actually find useful

13:07.280 --> 13:11.840
information on Google? Well now you have an AI generated answer, followed by some shopping

13:11.840 --> 13:17.920
results followed by four ad slots before you see the first actual result. You now often have to scroll

13:17.920 --> 13:23.600
quite far down just to see the first result and that actual first result is going to be a Reddit

13:23.600 --> 13:28.400
post from 15 years ago. Remember when you could actually call up a company if you had a problem

13:28.400 --> 13:33.440
and there would be a human, a person at the other end who would actually, I don't know, help you

13:33.440 --> 13:38.880
with your problem? Well, now that person has been fired so that the company can have less cost and

13:39.280 --> 13:45.360
make more profits and instead you have the AI chatbot which apparently is what everybody wants

13:45.360 --> 13:51.040
because I don't know about you but every single time I speak to one of these chatbots I immediately

13:51.040 --> 13:57.600
get the perfect resolution to all of my problems and I do not sit there staring at the fucking screen

13:57.600 --> 14:04.320
spitting and fuming in rage when the AI chatbot gives me yet another generic answer, sends me to the

14:04.320 --> 14:10.960
FAQs or asks me to rephrase the question. It's indisputable that in the long run AI is going to

14:10.960 --> 14:16.240
fundamentally improve our lives. It's here to stay, it's going to do great things. When AI can

14:16.240 --> 14:20.960
drive your car for you, when AI can take over the boring chores and do the shit that you don't want

14:20.960 --> 14:26.240
to do or when AI can automate the jobs that people would prefer not doing but at the moment

14:26.800 --> 14:32.320
companies are a million miles from there, they're just using the hype for personal advantage,

14:32.320 --> 14:38.320
they're busy faking AI and then promoting that fake AI to boost their share price because who

14:38.320 --> 14:44.800
cares about the fact that your product is actually worse? Who cares if that AI is actually unprofitable?

14:44.800 --> 14:50.000
Who cares that you piss off your customers and ruin your product? Remember you are a monopoly,

14:50.000 --> 14:56.800
it doesn't matter, it's AI bro and AI means that your stock just keeps on going up to the moon.
