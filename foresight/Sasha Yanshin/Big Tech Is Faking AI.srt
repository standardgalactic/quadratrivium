1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey guys, it's Sasha. The world is obsessed with AI. Every company is busy telling its

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,640
shareholders that they are now not a retail company, not a software company, not a car company,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,960
not a social media company. No, they are all now artificial intelligence companies.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
And you can't blame them. Since the start of 2022, the stock market has had one of the worst

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,200
crashes in history. Stocks fell 25% in 2022 and have not recovered since then. But at the same

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,480
time, the S&P 500 is at an all-time high. And this is because in the last 18 months,

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,440
since chatGPT arrived, the small number of AI stocks have absolutely exploded in value,

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
which has covered up what's actually happening out there to the rest of the stock market.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,520
The race for being the leader in AI is so hot that there is now huge pressure on companies to

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,440
release AI products, on companies to call things AI, where maybe they're not quite AI,

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,360
or not at all AI, not because they actually make things better for users if they use AI in many

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,840
cases, but because if you have a high enough density of using the word AI in your quarterly

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,520
earnings call, your share price automatically increases by 300%. And the problem is that a

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,800
lot of these big companies are now so far up their own backside, they are faking their AI,

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,440
because they need to put out something that looks like AI, that they can sell as AI, but they

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,160
haven't actually figured out how to make that AI work yet. They haven't actually made it work,

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,200
so let's pretend. So yesterday, the information published a story leaked by an Amazon insider.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
In the last two years or so, Amazon have released their Just Walk Out technology in some of their

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,440
shops. The idea is that you can just walk in and Amazon developed this AI that automatically checks

20
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,680
what it is that you put in your basket through cameras and sensors in the shop, and you don't

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,160
have to queue up or to check out, you don't have to pay for it, you just walk out of the store

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,720
with the stuff that you've picked up, and you will get billed automatically afterwards. Now,

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,600
I tried this a few times, although the prices in these shops are so high, it doesn't make any sense,

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,720
and I only really did it for novelty value, but the weird thing is that when you go and do the

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,440
shop, you don't get an immediate notification when you come out saying, you know, hey Sasha,

26
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,000
thanks for shopping with Amazon, here is your itemised bill, we've charged your credit card $25,

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,720
no, it takes several hours for that to happen. And I thought that was a bit strange, because if

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,640
it's automatic, if it's driven by AI, why does it take several hours for the automatic life system

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,960
to send you the bill? Well, it now turns out that this AI was actually 1,000 people sitting in a

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,600
room somewhere in India, watching the cameras from the shops and manually adjusting your basket.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,080
According to this whistleblower, 70% of all transactions in these shops were processed

32
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,960
manually via this team in India, I guess anything other than you may be picking up one item for

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,480
the novelty value, and then walking straight out becomes too complicated for this AI to actually

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,520
process. Amazon quickly tried to perform damage limitation, and Amazon spokesman came out and

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,000
said that associates may validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,560
technology cannot determine with complete confidence and the individual's purchases.

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,160
Amazon went and quickly deleted a bunch of pages which described this AI when they first launched

38
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,160
the product. According to Amazon, this story is completely untrue, and the system works great,

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,840
and their associates in India are really just there to help train the AI system, which is working

40
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,640
just fine, which is why two days ago, just before, immediately before that new story broke, because

41
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,000
Amazon knew it was coming, they announced that they are cancelling the just walkout system in their

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,280
stores, the one that's working really great, and they are replacing it with shopping trolleys.

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,200
But Amazon is not the only big company that is actively faking AI. Back in December,

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,080
Google announced Gemini, because I guess even the execs at Google realized that even though

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,920
their personal butler at home is called Bard, it is in fact actually a pretty bad name for an AI tool.

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,360
So in December, Google published this video where they showcased the capability of Gemini.

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,440
They would show Gemini things, ask Gemini things, and it would respond, except it came out sometime

48
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,280
after that video was published, that the entire thing was faked. The interaction was faked,

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,280
the video was faked, the responses were manually fed through to the AI engine, submitting some

50
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,680
hyper specific still images, not what was in the video, until the AI just happened to give

51
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,520
the right answer, and then they put all those right answers together, did a voiceover of the

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,960
answers to pretend that it worked seamlessly as it did in the video. It's not the first time Google

53
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,120
faked an AI demo. Back in 2018, Sunda Pichai demonstrated an AI system called Duplex.

54
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,200
By the way, what is it with a reference to the number two? Duplex, Gemini, anyway. In 2018,

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,320
Google demonstrated that this new AI assistant can do things like phone a restaurant on your

56
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,720
behalf to make you a reservation, so you don't have to. I'm looking for something on May 3rd,

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:36,000
and naturally, people asked a lot of questions, people were intrigued, and Google ignored all

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,080
those questions. The most obvious question was, was that demonstration completely faking fake?

59
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,200
Because it sure looked like a complete fake in the video, and well, six years later,

60
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,560
that assistant still doesn't exist. So you can decide for yourself whether that was another

61
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,840
completely fabricated bit of AI, but it doesn't stop there. You know the mysterious Google

62
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,360
algorithm, the almighty powerful algorithm that decides which websites get shown for which results?

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
Well, Google has long been saying how advanced their ranking system is, you know, how results are

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,680
automatically generated. This whole thing is being operated by extremely sophisticated AI.

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,280
There is a whole page rank system behind the scenes that automatically determines if your

66
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,280
content is helpful, and there is no human element to it whatsoever to prevent bias, right? Well,

67
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,120
it just so happens that Google employs 16,000 people called quality raters. There is a whole

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,720
giant training document for these people, here it is, it's 170 pages long, and these people spend

69
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,560
all day every day manually assessing the websites, you know, the websites that are ranked by this

70
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
really amazing AI. For example, they're meant to try and check if the content creator lacks adequate

71
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,960
experience, lacks adequate expertise, if the content creator is not an authoritative or

72
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,200
trustworthy source. And by the way, your website gets the lowest possible score if the website

73
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,840
terms of use states that some articles are generated by artificial intelligence and may have errors

74
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,640
or be out of date, which of course makes perfect sense because instead of showing these rubbish

75
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,120
websites, Google now shows you answers generated by artificial intelligence that often have errors

76
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
and the information is out of date, talking of which the most talked about AI that exists today

77
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,520
is chat GPT by open AI. It is like the holy grail. And of course, Bing, Microsoft search engine,

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,600
uses open AI in their results. And you know the spiel you told that these are highly sophisticated,

79
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,400
highly complex systems that learn on data that you feed into it. And then it becomes incredibly

80
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,880
intelligent. You see, learning on other people's data is not stealing. It is not copyright theft.

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,880
It is far more advanced than that. You just don't get it. It's a bit like how artists learn by looking

82
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:59,920
at other artists, they grow up. And to be honest, these AI models are just so complicated that none

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:06,480
of us with our small brains can possibly understand or compute how clever they are because they do

84
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,720
not. Do not scrape the internet and then just spit out that same content. No, no, no, no, no.

85
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,480
I went and asked Bing to tell me what the best road trips from Las Vegas are. And it said,

86
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,920
certainly, if you're in Las Vegas and looking for exciting road trips, here are some fantastic

87
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,000
options. One, Nelson Goes Town and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Interesting choice at number one.

88
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,680
It's funny because there is this article here written by some guy called Sasha called 21

89
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,960
best road trips from Las Vegas. And you know what? It's not the best article out there.

90
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,480
But wouldn't you know it? And the number one spot in this article is also Nelson Goes Town

91
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,440
and El Dorado Canyon Gold Mine. Word for word. How strange. How far is it? Well, it's exactly 45

92
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,720
minutes and 45 miles from Las Vegas, which is interesting because that's a very precise number

93
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,200
of minutes. But you know, probably just a coincidence. So just outside Las Vegas, you'll find the

94
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,640
Ghost Town of Nelson. There's half rusted old cars, you know, an interesting phrase to use.

95
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,800
It's a very unusual way of putting that. Then there's rattlesnakes in a freezer. Hmm. According

96
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,240
to Google, there is literally only one results on the internet that uses this exact phrase.

97
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,600
And I guess rattlesnakes should be spelled as one word. I guess I made a mistake. Well, never mind.

98
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,720
Bing also spelt it as two words. Such a coincidence is crazy. So then there's even

99
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,720
crashed airplanes. Take care when exploring, though, because rattlesnakes are common. Tours

100
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,600
of the gold mine run at 9am, 12pm and 2pm, taking you through Nevada's richest mine that operated

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,480
for nearly 80 years. And you know what? I just checked their website and it's funny because I

102
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:58,720
actually got that last bit wrong. The mine ran from 1861 until 1942. So it was actually a bit

103
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,200
more than 80 years. Isn't it such a coincidence that Bing made the same exact mistake using

104
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
the same exact words? Anyway, number two on their list is the Valley of Fire State Park.

105
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,400
And it's 50 minutes and 49 miles from Las Vegas. Very precise. Although strangely,

106
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,160
if you look it up on Bing Maps, you know, the Bing map service, that says 53 miles because I

107
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,080
guess Bing Maps is measuring to the middle of the park. Where do they get the 49 miles from?

108
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,480
How strange. Anyway, you get the point. This AI is just plain stealing content from other websites.

109
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,200
Slightly changing some of the words and showing that instead of showing the website from which

110
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
the information was stolen. Just because this information is processed and stored in a neural

111
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,480
net does not somehow make it immune from general laws about theft. This AI is what is known in

112
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,040
the industry as an automated content spinner. You might have noticed in the last six months

113
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,840
that a huge number of smaller medium sized websites have stopped being shown on Google.

114
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,720
They're disappearing. These websites are going bankrupt because they're getting no traffic now.

115
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,120
Now when you search something, you get an AI answer from the search engine, which basically

116
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,400
has stolen the content of those small websites that they no longer show. Then you get a 15 year

117
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,880
old Reddit post at the top. This of course has nothing to do with Google signing a commercial

118
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,160
deal with Reddit to use Reddit data for their AI training. It has nothing to do with Reddit traffic

119
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,000
randomly growing by over 500% in the last few months for no apparent reason whatsoever

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
because Google is now sending them all of the traffic that they used to send to the small

121
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,400
websites. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Reddit just went and did an IPO. Immediately

122
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,640
after their traffic exploded and the owner of Reddit sold a massive boatload of shares becoming

123
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,120
incredibly rich after the company was valued based on the fact that their traffic is now

124
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,600
500% higher than it was a year ago. This of course is all a complete coincidence. The fact is

125
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,280
there are a lot of people making a lot of money from this AI hype wave. Not in the sense of

126
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,120
earning revenue and making profits because no, AI is a loss making in most cases at the moment.

127
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,400
But in the sense of the price of company shares, a lot of companies including the very biggest

128
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,840
companies in the world are now so balls deep in their commitment to AI because it's all smoke

129
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,080
mirrors and pretend games that they have to lie, they have to break the law and they have to create

130
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,520
fake AI to keep their stock price high. Making false statements as a publicly traded company

131
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,320
about your AI capabilities is not punished. The SEC does not seem to give a shit that these

132
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,680
companies are openly brazenly lying about their products to their customers, about their developments

133
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,120
and new releases to their investors. It's AI bro, it's the future, it's pushing the boundaries

134
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,800
and the result? Well, other than the stock price going up on a vertical line, the real life experience

135
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,280
of people in many cases is getting worse. Remember when you could actually find useful

136
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,840
information on Google? Well now you have an AI generated answer, followed by some shopping

137
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,920
results followed by four ad slots before you see the first actual result. You now often have to scroll

138
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,600
quite far down just to see the first result and that actual first result is going to be a Reddit

139
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,400
post from 15 years ago. Remember when you could actually call up a company if you had a problem

140
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,440
and there would be a human, a person at the other end who would actually, I don't know, help you

141
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,880
with your problem? Well, now that person has been fired so that the company can have less cost and

142
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:45,360
make more profits and instead you have the AI chatbot which apparently is what everybody wants

143
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,040
because I don't know about you but every single time I speak to one of these chatbots I immediately

144
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,600
get the perfect resolution to all of my problems and I do not sit there staring at the fucking screen

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,320
spitting and fuming in rage when the AI chatbot gives me yet another generic answer, sends me to the

146
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,960
FAQs or asks me to rephrase the question. It's indisputable that in the long run AI is going to

147
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,240
fundamentally improve our lives. It's here to stay, it's going to do great things. When AI can

148
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,960
drive your car for you, when AI can take over the boring chores and do the shit that you don't want

153
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Who cares that you piss off your customers and ruin your product? Remember you are a monopoly,

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,800
it doesn't matter, it's AI bro and AI means that your stock just keeps on going up to the moon.
