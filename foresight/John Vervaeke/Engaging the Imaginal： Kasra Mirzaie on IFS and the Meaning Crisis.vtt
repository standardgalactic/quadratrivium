00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Reveki. I am here with Kazara Mirzai.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.920
Kazara is going to be part of this ongoing discussion. We're having on this channel

00:09.920 --> 00:17.520
with people who are practitioners and also researchers about IFS, Internal Family Systems

00:17.520 --> 00:24.240
Theory. And I'm very excited about this. I've met Kazara offline and we've got a really interesting

00:24.240 --> 00:29.360
conversation. I'm rather looking forward to this one. But Kazara, why don't you introduce yourself,

00:29.360 --> 00:35.120
tell us a little bit more about your background, and then maybe we can talk about some of your work

00:35.120 --> 00:41.120
and how it weaves into what we're doing here at the Reveki Foundation. And then we'll just take

00:41.120 --> 00:48.400
it from there. Yes, thank you very much, John. Thanks for having me. Oh, great pleasure. Yeah,

00:48.400 --> 00:56.560
so I'm a psychotherapist by training. I'm a practitioner. I'm a clinician. And I'm a researcher

00:56.560 --> 01:02.880
and teacher at the university in Hildesheim in Germany. And what I focus on is like there are

01:02.880 --> 01:09.120
a couple of things I focus on. So my research is on emotion regulation and developmental

01:09.120 --> 01:17.280
psychopathology. So I'm looking mostly on adolescent, on the adolescent age and the age group. And

01:18.080 --> 01:26.000
what I'm doing there is I look at how psychotherapy has an impact on it. So we know that

01:26.080 --> 01:33.040
psychotherapy works, but we don't know why to a lot of degrees. And I have a more of a dynamical

01:33.040 --> 01:39.120
systems theoretical view on it. And I look at affect dynamics and see how affecting emotion

01:39.120 --> 01:48.640
fluctuate and have their ups and downs and look at those in especially teenagers. But at the same

01:48.640 --> 01:55.600
time, I'm also more oriented to more global view, more theoretical view. And I'm also deeply

01:55.600 --> 02:04.240
influenced by one of my doctoral supervisors, Werner Greve. He's a professor for developmental

02:04.240 --> 02:10.080
psychology. And he's actually, I'm in this academic ancestral line of Balthus and Staudinger.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.720
You mentioned them in the meeting process. So Werner Greve, he actually, he did his PhD under

02:16.720 --> 02:22.400
Paul Balthus. So he has this lifespan, lifespan perspective on, on development. And

02:23.280 --> 02:28.080
yeah, I try to bring in those aspects, but also the theoretical aspects. And he's also deeply

02:28.080 --> 02:34.400
into action theory and philosophical psychology. So I also follow this, this trend to look more

02:34.400 --> 02:40.400
broadly onto meaning making, I would say. And this is where IFS comes in. And as a practitioner of

02:40.400 --> 02:48.960
IFS and a research, I also do research on it. Yeah, I'm deeply interested in the also in the

02:48.960 --> 02:54.400
cocci of it and the cognitive science of it. And yeah, and this whole machinery of meaning

02:54.400 --> 03:02.080
making. So yeah, that's where I come from. What would you like to talk about first? I mean,

03:02.080 --> 03:10.160
we could pick up on a particular thread and give people, you know, a more specific example of

03:10.160 --> 03:15.920
what your work looks like and how it's related to meaning and the meaning crisis, perhaps that

03:15.920 --> 03:21.840
would be great. Yeah, I think, oh, that's a good question where to start. I think there are several

03:22.640 --> 03:30.080
paths, paths that could, that we could take. And maybe start, I know that your audience knows

03:30.880 --> 03:36.000
IFS by now, but maybe just to sum up for them. I think we could, we can always talk more about

03:36.000 --> 03:43.600
it. I mean, I, yeah, the work with, with Seth, Seth Allen, Seth Allison has been

03:44.560 --> 03:53.200
really, really profound. And, but I think having many voices articulate what it is could be very

03:53.200 --> 04:01.600
helpful to our listeners. Yes. And I really enjoyed those videos. I also wanted to extend that and

04:01.600 --> 04:07.120
tell you that I think you both have done a very wonderful job. It was, it was actually really

04:07.200 --> 04:14.320
different to experience both of you. I mean, Seth does, you know, did an excellent job. He has this

04:14.320 --> 04:20.240
wonderful personality. And you also show different sides and aspects of yourself, John. So I really

04:20.240 --> 04:27.760
like that too. Yeah, well, thank you for saying that. And I apologize to Seth. I think when I

04:27.760 --> 04:32.480
first mentioned him, I confused him with Seth Dillinger. I apologize about that. But Seth Allison,

04:32.480 --> 04:41.520
yes. Yeah, he, we spoke before time and he proposed doing this. And yeah, I knew it would be

04:41.520 --> 04:51.440
challenging. But I thought people needed a concrete example in order to get a deeper sense of what

04:51.440 --> 04:57.680
was going on. I agree. I agree. Hey, I think sometimes we tend to be way too abstract and

04:57.680 --> 05:03.440
theoretical. So we need something to ground ourselves again. So yeah, maybe to connect to that.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.440
Yeah, just really, really briefly, shortly at what I, what I think or my take on IFS is that

05:10.160 --> 05:17.360
it's actually a model of a living and self organizing psyche that is composed of, I would say

05:17.360 --> 05:23.600
living things. And Dick Schwartz would say sub personalities or we could call them parts.

05:24.560 --> 05:31.040
And yeah, those interact with each other in a certain, and again, this is my language in a

05:31.040 --> 05:39.920
certain qualitative space and relationship that we would call the self. And so you see again,

05:39.920 --> 05:45.520
this is my notion of it. It's actually tainted there. I don't assume a monadic self. I rather

05:46.160 --> 05:52.720
assume a relational, flexible, and the self is more as a process than a product.

05:55.200 --> 06:01.280
So in that sense, IFS assumes the multiplicity of the psyche or a multiplicity of the psyche.

06:02.400 --> 06:08.240
And yeah, I would, I would, I would want to start maybe by linking it to the meaning crisis,

06:08.240 --> 06:14.160
because I think this is so deeply important. And then we can come to my work and how

06:14.160 --> 06:20.080
my perspectives from I also forgot to mention that I worked many years in psycho oncology and

06:20.080 --> 06:27.680
pediatric psycho oncology. And, and I currently work at a residential adolescent residential

06:27.680 --> 06:32.560
crisis center where I work like with borderline personality disorders and very, very traumatized

06:32.560 --> 06:40.240
young people. And I'm so confronted with this whole absurdity and the meaning crisis that

06:40.480 --> 06:48.080
you automatically you try to find ways and try to make sense out of it. So, and I see deep,

06:48.080 --> 06:54.400
deep connections there. And so I would say the short answer is that IFS helps both the cognitive,

06:55.120 --> 07:01.760
as well as the existential and spiritual machinery of meaning making. So that's, yeah,

07:01.760 --> 07:09.600
that's very powerful. Yeah, and I think via a dialectic, it's a dialectical approach.

07:10.640 --> 07:16.640
And, and I think we can add in more mythos. And I mean, not only the logos, but also the mythos.

07:17.360 --> 07:23.360
And fundamentally, IFS, again, is a dialogical practice and a form, I would say a form of

07:23.360 --> 07:30.000
serious play to use one of your terms or you to use your language. And the serious play,

07:30.880 --> 07:39.200
it helps to systematically modify salience, in a sense. And, and, and obviously to switch and,

07:39.200 --> 07:43.600
and change perspectives. So this perspective taking is very, very important. And I think

07:43.600 --> 07:50.400
IFS is powerful in doing so. And it helps you forward and come into contact with your,

07:51.280 --> 07:57.440
yeah, with different aspects of your, of your being and your identity. And, and, and, and, and

07:57.440 --> 08:04.160
doing so get a grasp on your inner conflict in a platonic sense. And to resolve, hopefully resolve

08:04.160 --> 08:13.280
those inner conflicts. That was just, wow, that was just wonderful. So let me see, I want to,

08:13.280 --> 08:18.240
I want to make sure I get all these. So as you mentioned, salience and perspective taking,

08:18.800 --> 08:25.040
you, you mentioned people get sort of an enrichment of their self awareness. They, they

08:26.400 --> 08:32.080
discover, uncover, realize different aspects of themselves. And then

08:32.640 --> 08:39.840
there's also you, you were talking a little bit. Well, let's start with those three, first of all.

08:41.600 --> 08:51.120
And then we can pick up on any threads that are remaining. So I get, I, I get that it alters

08:51.120 --> 09:01.120
salience. Because it gets people to pay attention to things they weren't previously paying attention

09:01.120 --> 09:06.560
to within their psyche. Is that the main, that's the salience? I know I might be oversimplifying.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.080
I'm just trying to get the initial idea. No, I think, I think that's, that's totally fair.

09:10.800 --> 09:16.560
And, and I think there was, there was again, a machinery behind that. And I think this has deeply

09:16.560 --> 09:24.480
to do with, I think, dynamical systems theory can here can help us understand what we mean also

09:24.480 --> 09:29.920
by this idea of salience. So what I understand, or what I mean when I talk about salience is that,

09:30.720 --> 09:35.440
and again, I would say this is deeply psychodynamic or depth psychological. That's

09:36.480 --> 09:42.800
IFS is really related to that. That you're not the master in your own house. Something is driving

09:42.800 --> 09:47.440
you. Right? Yeah. And that's the poconic theme you were bringing up earlier about. Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.440 --> 09:54.960
Exactly. Something is driving you. So those different forces. And they have their own framing.

09:55.600 --> 10:00.560
They have their own sets of glasses that they put on, right? Yeah. They see the world

10:00.560 --> 10:05.440
from their perspectives, because they have their own agent arena relationship.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.160
Yeah. Yeah, that's what this is what I was bringing in. And, and what I mean when I talk

10:10.160 --> 10:20.480
about dynamical systems theory is that I think those forces that drive us, they, they are a system,

10:20.560 --> 10:25.680
in a sense that they are a complex system, biological system. That's why I'm talking about

10:25.680 --> 10:33.760
living things, which means, and living things are memory systems. And I think this is, this is an

10:33.760 --> 10:41.200
aspect of dynamical systems theory that is often overlooked. But we're, it's, they are deeply,

10:41.200 --> 10:46.240
so biological systems are memory systems. And this has to do with this technical notion of

10:46.240 --> 10:52.800
non-urgidicity. And I don't know if we should expand on this or not, but... Well, we could.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.800
I mean, it overlaps with some of the significant work Michael Levin's doing in some of the

10:56.800 --> 11:01.760
conversations I've had with him. Can I, can I, can I, can I ask you a question at this point?

11:01.760 --> 11:08.320
Yeah. So I get that this is wonderful. So let's at least say there are sort of autopoietic systems

11:08.320 --> 11:13.120
right there. They, they're, they're seeing the world in a certain way, and they have a certain

11:13.120 --> 11:18.160
function, and they're trying to maintain themselves and, and satisfy that function or functions. I

11:18.160 --> 11:24.560
don't want to be simplistic. Is that okay so far? Absolutely. And then, and I like this idea of they,

11:24.560 --> 11:29.200
they each have a different framing and agent arena relationship. And that means, of course,

11:29.200 --> 11:35.120
they can come into conflict in some significant way. And this is the platonic model you were

11:35.120 --> 11:40.000
alluding to earlier from the Republic, right? You've got this inner conflict. And then I,

11:40.640 --> 11:48.720
I've been wondering about this. So I have a question to ask. So Plato posits the idea that

11:48.720 --> 11:56.720
we have metadrives. We have two fundamental metadrives. One is a kind of inner justice,

11:56.720 --> 12:03.600
inner peace. We, we, whatever it, however we try to satisfy our goals and our desire, sorry,

12:03.600 --> 12:08.400
satisfy our desires and reach our goals. We don't want that to cause more internal conflict. We

12:08.400 --> 12:14.880
want it to bring resolution to that conflict and an inner binding and an inner religio. And then we

12:14.880 --> 12:23.920
have another important drive, which is we want to be most in contact with what is most real. We

12:23.920 --> 12:29.840
don't want whatever is satisfying our goals or satisfying our desires to be illusory, fraudulent,

12:29.840 --> 12:35.360
anything. And so the question is this, I, I'm not very happy with, you know, thinking about the

12:35.360 --> 12:41.520
self as some sort of thing. And you seem to be also like that. You described it as a space. And I,

12:41.520 --> 12:46.000
I'm thinking, I'm wondering if it's a functional space. What do I mean by that is maybe perhaps

12:46.000 --> 12:53.200
the self is understood as that which is these two metadrives. The self is that which is driving

12:53.200 --> 13:00.000
for the resolution of inner conflict and bringing us into conflict, sorry, bringing us into contact

13:00.000 --> 13:04.560
with reality. What do you think about that as a proposal? That that is maybe how we could understand

13:04.640 --> 13:09.200
the fundamental functionality of the self. Given that you raised the platonic model, it seems like

13:09.200 --> 13:14.640
there's a way of understanding the self in terms of that platonic model. That's wonderful.

13:15.520 --> 13:21.840
Can you repeat that again? That's so, that's so rich. I have to think about this again.

13:22.720 --> 13:30.960
Yeah. So Plato has this proposal, right? He doesn't state it like it explicitly as a,

13:31.840 --> 13:37.200
as a standalone proposition, but it very clearly comes out in many places, in many dialogues,

13:37.200 --> 13:43.840
most prominently in the Republic, which is the one you were alluding to, that we, we have a desire

13:43.840 --> 13:49.680
for inner peace. But this is not just, that's why he also uses the word justice. It's that,

13:49.680 --> 13:55.760
Yes, it's the optimal gripping. It's the optimal gripping. It's this harmonic interplay, right?

13:55.760 --> 14:01.760
Yes. Yes. And so we want, we have this, there's a, there's a meta drive to bring about that

14:01.760 --> 14:06.960
harmonic interplay. So you can call it sort of this vertical optimal gripping, if I can allow

14:06.960 --> 14:14.000
that. And then we also have this meta drive of horizontal optimal gripping with the world

14:14.000 --> 14:20.800
and other people. And the self is those two functions. And what Plato talks about is it's

14:20.800 --> 14:26.960
possible to actually coordinate the satisfaction of those two functions. And I would put it to you

14:26.960 --> 14:32.640
that it sounds to me like IFS is exactly a practice for coordinating them, because you're

14:32.640 --> 14:38.480
trying to get the parts in this harmonious sense so that you can get a better grip on reality

14:39.120 --> 14:44.080
thereby. Wonderful. That's exactly what I'm, when I'm thinking, there's so many things there

14:44.720 --> 14:54.240
that I can, I can follow up on maybe. So I absolutely think it's about meta desires,

14:54.240 --> 14:59.680
because, and I, and I would bring also in the good, the true and the beautiful, especially the good.

15:01.680 --> 15:05.680
Yeah, it's these two axes, right? The two are good and the beautiful are going both ways. Yes.

15:05.680 --> 15:12.800
Because when you actually do parts work, and, and they, they get into this harmonic

15:12.800 --> 15:22.160
self organization and self realization, is that now, at least it feels like they're committed to

15:22.160 --> 15:29.120
something that they share, what parts share, and if this transcends their individual desires and

15:29.120 --> 15:34.960
needs. So there are meta desires and meta needs. And I think that is to be deeply in contact with

15:34.960 --> 15:41.600
reality. That's one aspect. And, and for, for this harmonic interplay to go on, because it's an

15:41.600 --> 15:48.400
iterative game, right? So I, so, so the, the efficient, the resiliency is in this long term

15:48.400 --> 15:53.200
efficiency. So not only for the sake of self maintenance and in an auto poetic sense. And,

15:53.200 --> 15:58.960
and I think this makes it deeply human. And we should definitely talk about anthropology

15:58.960 --> 16:04.800
as well. And this connects to my work in, in oncology, and also as in psychiatry,

16:04.800 --> 16:09.280
because I think it's missing, we have deeply dehumanized anthropology going on. But

16:11.280 --> 16:16.320
what I mean by, by, make us human is to not only to care for ourselves, but also to care for others.

16:17.600 --> 16:23.840
I think that's, I think that's wonderful. So this, this, so Plato has a term, and you might

16:23.920 --> 16:30.160
have heard me talk about it, the anagoge for, right? And, and, and so I, I think you're in

16:30.160 --> 16:35.760
agreement, the self is kind of the anagoge function. It's these two meta desires, right,

16:35.760 --> 16:39.840
coordinated together to bring about the reciprocal opening of the human being,

16:39.840 --> 16:45.120
the flourishing with the world. And I think this connection is, I think, really, really

16:45.760 --> 16:53.360
powerful. Because I think if we, if we agree that what Plato is proposing is something that

16:53.360 --> 16:59.520
increases our inner peace, our connectedness to a reality, affords our capacity for self-transcendence,

16:59.520 --> 17:04.080
cultivation of wisdom, we're not talking about something that can properly be called spiritual

17:05.040 --> 17:12.640
without having to invoke any supernaturalism. And this, I think, and as I've had discussions

17:12.640 --> 17:17.200
with people doing IFS, many of them want to sort of bring out the fact that IFS has this sort of

17:17.200 --> 17:22.960
spiritual dimension to it. And I think that lines up with your wanting to bring in the mythos and

17:23.040 --> 17:31.680
the imaginal. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Wow. Thank you, John. That's, you're exactly saying what I am,

17:31.680 --> 17:36.880
what I was thinking. Thank you for watching. This YouTube and podcast series is by the

17:54.160 --> 17:58.960
I want to propose something to you. And this is really something to do with your work. And,

17:58.960 --> 18:03.680
and I hope I get your work right. And you can now see if I get your work right. And if not,

18:03.680 --> 18:08.400
please correct me or add or compliment to it. Yeah, we'll work, we'll work through,

18:08.400 --> 18:14.160
we'll work through anything that comes up together as friends. I want to compare you to Kant,

18:14.720 --> 18:21.520
okay? So I want to see where both overlap. So the way I understand your work is,

18:22.320 --> 18:28.960
and where I see you both in agreement, so Kant and Verveke, is that you both understand that

18:28.960 --> 18:36.320
reality ultimately cannot be framed, right? So where I see you both differ is that what

18:36.320 --> 18:44.240
reality ultimately is. Now whereas Kant sees reality as this thing outside of our cognitive

18:44.240 --> 18:50.080
and rational faculties that uses frames and filters to make sense out of experiences,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.040
which leads Kant to the conclusion, right, that we cannot have this access to the thing in itself,

18:55.040 --> 19:01.920
this thing on sich, the Númena, and that we are ultimately trapped within our mind, I would propose

19:01.920 --> 19:10.000
John Verveke would say that although our frames prevent us of grasping the whole reality,

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
we can still participate in it, right? We nonetheless participate in reality via

19:16.000 --> 19:25.440
these things like myth-making, mythos, mythopoieses, music, symbols, art, rituals, poetry, and all of

19:25.440 --> 19:32.400
that. So I want to go on, if you just allow me, and this dance and this serious play between,

19:33.120 --> 19:40.160
so basically the imaginal, what I wanted to say. So basically the dance and serious play between

19:40.160 --> 19:49.120
the ultimate and the finite is a constant process of opening and closing. I would also say of homing

19:49.120 --> 19:55.920
and adventuring, right? So getting back to your home, to your basis, but also, you know, leaving

19:55.920 --> 20:02.400
this safe haven and also going to exploration, this meta assimilation, accommodation that you

20:02.400 --> 20:07.600
talk about. And this leads me to following conclusion. And now let's see if you agree,

20:07.600 --> 20:14.240
and because this brings, again, back in the idea of self. And where I see IFS overlap, but at the

20:14.240 --> 20:19.440
same time also different, where I also have problems with it, obviously. So I would say

20:20.400 --> 20:26.160
there is no soul beyond the body, that that's my first proposition. So there is no soul beyond the

20:26.160 --> 20:34.560
body. So the self-organizing process of me being in the world, being in space and time, infuses

20:34.560 --> 20:41.440
in nature, physical, right, is the soul. So the whole, the soul is that emergent thing out of the

20:41.440 --> 20:47.520
body, the interaction of the body, but at the same time that that emanates back, right? So the

20:47.520 --> 20:54.800
idea of emanation is important. So at this animating principle, the anima, the suke that we talk about.

20:54.800 --> 21:04.480
And the second proposal is there is no self beyond otherness. That's what I would propose. So

21:04.480 --> 21:10.720
meaning the self is this emergent thing out of the interactions of those parts. And again,

21:10.720 --> 21:16.880
this is why I think dynamical systems theory is so important, also from a scientific perspective,

21:16.880 --> 21:21.040
because it brings in this whole idea of myriology, this part's whole relationship.

21:21.840 --> 21:29.680
Yes, yes. And one of the many. Yeah, exactly, one of many, exactly. So the self that is that which

21:29.680 --> 21:39.200
homes otherness as spectrality, at the same time, it's the, you know, it's the parts and the otherness

21:39.200 --> 21:46.160
that gives home to the self. So I mean, Kirkegaard has this, has this, what's the quote, the self is

21:46.160 --> 21:51.680
a relation that relates itself to itself. So what I mean by relationship and process, and that's why

21:51.680 --> 21:57.280
I would agree it's not a monadic thing is that the self isn't is a constant process. And I love the

21:57.280 --> 22:04.640
idea that it's, that it's this two axis kind of thing that you mentioned, those two dimensions,

22:05.200 --> 22:08.400
the inner conflict, the resolution of inner conflict, as well as

22:09.200 --> 22:14.240
getting into contact with reality. Now, the third one, when I what I want to propose is that

22:14.880 --> 22:22.160
there was no, no thing, not a thing, no thing beyond the spirit of intelligibility. So beyond,

22:22.160 --> 22:27.360
in other words, beyond this organizing principle, the God beyond, beyond God's that you're talking

22:27.360 --> 22:34.960
about. And so, and I think this is what, what Jung would call the anima mundi or the uns mundos,

22:34.960 --> 22:40.560
and I think this is similar to the idea of self. So I think it's Jung is not talking about this.

22:40.560 --> 22:46.560
I mean, there are parts we're talking about this monadic self, but I assume he, I think he assumes

22:46.560 --> 22:52.080
something different when he talks about self, and it becomes clear when he talks about the mandala,

22:52.080 --> 22:58.000
like this four dimensions. To me, they are similar to those four dimensions of meaning-making,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.960
the nomological, the normative, and the narrative, as well as the connectedness. So,

23:04.000 --> 23:10.560
yeah, not to intellectualize too much now, but what I was trying to refer to is that

23:11.760 --> 23:18.640
in IFS, you often talk about the self as the part that is not a part. And to me, this

23:18.640 --> 23:24.960
eludes a lot, or there sounds very similar to the God that is not a God, or the God beyond God,

23:25.760 --> 23:31.120
the religion that is not a religion, so that it doesn't have this thinness to it.

23:31.920 --> 23:37.520
Yeah. What do you think? Well, that was incredibly rich. Yeah. Okay. So I'll try and trace through

23:37.520 --> 23:45.200
some of this. I think, yeah, what you said about my relationship to Kant is amazing. I take, of

23:45.200 --> 23:51.760
course, from Kant, the idea of framing, and then that's what the relevance realization,

23:51.760 --> 23:57.440
but unlike Kant, I don't think the mind is the author of framing. I think the mind participates

23:57.440 --> 24:02.960
with the world in framing. So I would add that E, right? There's in framing going on,

24:02.960 --> 24:08.880
relevance is something co-created by the world and the mind. And that's what makes me fundamentally

24:08.880 --> 24:14.880
different from Kant and makes me a plateness, because I believe in this sense of participation.

24:14.880 --> 24:19.680
So I think if that lands back with you well, I think we understand each other very well. You

24:19.680 --> 24:24.800
understand me very well. I think that's true. Yes. I even think I understand why you think that

24:24.800 --> 24:29.680
that is. And I think it's because of those bioeconomic constraints that we have. I mean,

24:29.680 --> 24:35.920
it has to be to make, so that we can give an account of evolution as well. So we have to

24:35.920 --> 24:42.400
participate in being in contact somehow with reality. So it wouldn't make sense with evolutionary

24:42.400 --> 24:51.600
theory in a deep sense. And it also means that we can sidestep a lot of significant contradictions

24:51.600 --> 24:58.240
in Kant. Kant denies, because the mind does, in his view, mind frames only in terms that are

24:59.200 --> 25:04.960
relative to human experience. We can have no knowledge of God. But as other people pointed

25:04.960 --> 25:09.440
out almost immediately, that same argument applies completely to the thing in itself,

25:09.520 --> 25:15.760
which means Kant becomes a kind of Berkeley and idealist, and he resisted that. And I don't want

25:15.760 --> 25:26.560
to get into the technicalities. But I think you very much have caught the deep gist of what I'm

25:26.560 --> 25:32.880
saying. Thank you. That's important to me, John, because I think in this way, I understand you

25:32.880 --> 25:38.240
better. I think if I speak your language, we can communicate better. So that's why it was

25:38.320 --> 25:45.360
important for me to get your feedback on that. I appreciate that. Now, I want to thank you.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.200
Sorry, this may come off as arrogant. I don't mean it to you. It's just because of my

25:51.200 --> 25:54.960
particular education. It's usually me trying to reach the language of the person I'm talking to.

25:54.960 --> 26:02.640
Yes, I get that. And so I really appreciate this. The idea that I think there's two

26:03.440 --> 26:12.960
ideas. Your first two proposals about the soul, I put them together. I think they belong together

26:12.960 --> 26:17.520
in the claim that the self is not substantial. The self is not a substance. The self is not an

26:17.520 --> 26:23.520
independently existing thing. We give up that Aristotelian model that the self is a substance.

26:23.520 --> 26:29.040
And I think a standard model of the soul, not all models of the soul in all versions of Christianity

26:29.040 --> 26:37.040
by any means or in Islam or anything like that. But many central models of the soul is that it is

26:37.040 --> 26:44.800
a substance. It is a standalone thing to which all properties and relations and actions belong.

26:44.800 --> 26:52.080
And I think that is fundamentally misplaced. I think it is to get things exactly the wrong

26:52.080 --> 26:58.480
way around. I think this goes to what you were saying about no-thingness and other things. I

26:58.480 --> 27:07.440
think the relationality, the intelligibility is primary and that relata emerge out of that

27:07.440 --> 27:12.960
relational field. And this maps very well to the bottom of our physics and the top of our physics.

27:12.960 --> 27:20.800
And so I'm not saying anything really bizarre or weird. And I won't go into that argument,

27:20.800 --> 27:27.760
but I am totally in agreement. And therefore, understanding the self as inherently dialogical

27:27.760 --> 27:34.160
as self and other bound together. And I think of it as there being a deep continuity. I think

27:35.120 --> 27:41.280
John Verweyke is a distributed cognition of the collective intelligence of parts of his brain

27:41.280 --> 27:50.240
all the way down to sorgans and systems and cells. And I think John Verweyke is part of systems of

27:50.240 --> 27:54.720
distributed cognition and collective intelligence that make up various cultural

27:54.720 --> 27:59.840
environments and historical environments that he's operating in. And I think there's deep

27:59.840 --> 28:08.640
continuity down and up. And I think that means the self is inherently non-substantial. So it's

28:08.640 --> 28:16.000
not a thing. If by thing we mean a bounded, basiotemporal, independently existing thing.

28:16.800 --> 28:22.960
And I think there is this deep continuity down into the depths of our body and up to the heights

28:22.960 --> 28:29.200
of our spirit, because that's what we're actually talking about here. And in that sense, it is a

28:29.200 --> 28:34.800
body double. And I agree with that, right? It's sort of, it's bound to the body in this and our

28:34.800 --> 28:45.200
embodiment in a very powerful way. And then this idea that we, like the cosmos, are enmeshed in

28:45.200 --> 28:53.920
the issue of the one in the mini, the emergence and the emanation. I think that is correct. And I

28:53.920 --> 28:58.400
think that's a profound example of participatory knowing. It's not that we know the one in the

28:58.400 --> 29:04.880
mini. We are the one in the mini. We know it by participating in its very principle and processes.

29:04.880 --> 29:10.240
Of course, the content of your cognition and mine are different, but they share this same

29:10.240 --> 29:18.000
fundamental grammar and we share it together with reality. And I think that is a deep, deeply

29:18.000 --> 29:22.240
important thing. And so I like the final proposal. I'm coming to your final proposal and then I'll

29:22.240 --> 29:27.600
shut up, which is there's something. Thank you. There's something in us that is like the neoplatonic

29:27.600 --> 29:34.080
one. There is something in us that is that participates, but, but it is not a part because

29:34.080 --> 29:39.920
it is the very principle of participation itself. And there is something in reality that is no kind

29:39.920 --> 29:47.680
of thing. It is the very principle of thingness, right? That of things emerging, of them being

29:47.680 --> 29:53.920
intelligible, of them entering into relationships with each other. And so I do think they're,

29:53.920 --> 29:59.760
and Proclas talked about this. There is the one within us that participates in the one without us,

29:59.760 --> 30:06.320
but of course they are ultimately just in some important and very hard to articulate sense one.

30:06.320 --> 30:14.160
And so I like that proposal. I like the proposal. Turning young, young into more of a neoplatness

30:14.160 --> 30:19.840
would be, I think, a wonderful thing to do. He's very platonic. I often call him the plate

30:19.840 --> 30:26.800
of the psyche. His notion of archetypes is just the notion of the forms, right? And so I think all

30:26.800 --> 30:33.040
of this deeply resonates. I hope I've done it justice in my reply to all of your proposals.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.480
Thank you, John. That's wonderful. And especially the last part that reminded me of

30:39.280 --> 30:45.280
we being the one that reminded me, I mean, that's such a platonic idea.

30:47.840 --> 30:54.320
So I want to circle back to the meaning crisis with that. I'm really grateful for

30:56.080 --> 31:02.880
you bringing back also this Persian heritage into the meaning crisis. I'm an Iranian.

31:02.880 --> 31:10.480
I'm Persian. And so first of all, thank you for that. Well, my partner, my partner, who is

31:11.440 --> 31:23.520
the profound beloved love of my life, is Persian. I didn't know that. Okay, that hits my heart.

31:24.960 --> 31:30.960
She's easily one of the best people I have met in my entire life.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.120
Yeah, I believe that.

31:39.120 --> 31:43.600
And what you said with the one, we being the one, this reminded me

31:45.520 --> 31:52.640
of a Persian myth by one of those Persian mystics and Sufis,

31:53.760 --> 31:59.280
Attar. I think he's one of the teachers of Rumi, if I'm not mistaken.

31:59.360 --> 32:03.360
The name is familiar to me. I'm learning a lot about the Sufi heritage right now.

32:03.360 --> 32:09.040
And there is this philosophical Silk Road. Yeah, it's so interesting. And there is this

32:10.160 --> 32:17.120
mythological being. It's called Seymour. Seymour is actually the spirit of intelligibility.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.800
I didn't know this. Say this again. How would I spell that?

32:21.760 --> 32:32.720
So S-I-M-O-R-G-H. Okay. The spirit of intelligibility. That's amazing.

32:32.720 --> 32:40.640
Yes. And Attar had this idea that, I think it's the conference of the birds, I think it's called.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.120
If I'm not mistaken. Parliament of the birds, I think I've heard of the birds ones.

32:46.000 --> 32:54.800
There are like thousands of birds that fly to find Seymour. And they have to go through seven

32:54.800 --> 33:00.880
valleys. And that's one is the valley of self-deception, one is the valley of detachment,

33:00.880 --> 33:06.640
and all those things. And ultimately, what happens is that out of those thousand birds,

33:06.640 --> 33:13.680
only 30 survive and they get there. But they don't find Seymour. They don't find this thing,

33:13.680 --> 33:20.480
this big bird, this mythological creature. They understand that they are Seymour. And you know

33:20.480 --> 33:29.440
what Seymour means in Persian is C means 30 and more means bird. So 30 birds, they survive and

33:29.440 --> 33:35.600
they realize they are actually the one. Yes. Yes. So that reminded me totally of that.

33:36.720 --> 33:41.440
I got to get this. I've heard of this and I've never read it, but I'm going to order it once

33:41.440 --> 33:47.280
we're done speaking because I've got to read this. This is wonderful mythos. So this brings us into

33:48.160 --> 33:53.600
that by which, and this is where Kant struggles, in fact, and where I'm trying to be very much

33:53.600 --> 34:01.920
more influenced by Corban. Yes. Ibn Arabi, Corban, in some ways sort of already the imaginal as that

34:01.920 --> 34:08.240
which bridges between the one and the mini and the inner and the outer. And it's not the imaginary.

34:08.240 --> 34:13.120
We don't look at these images. They are like icons. We look through them like the way I'm

34:13.120 --> 34:18.080
looking through my glasses. But it is also the way in which the world can reach back through them

34:18.080 --> 34:28.880
into us. It is not that way. It's both ways. It is in a sense. Go ahead. It's so wonderful that

34:28.880 --> 34:34.800
you invoke this idea. And I think this is so important to understand that the imaginal is,

34:35.760 --> 34:41.520
again, not a thing. And that's why we think imaginary or imagination or imaginal is not

34:41.520 --> 34:47.440
something real, but it is deeply real because it has this power. It's something like a catalyst.

34:47.440 --> 34:54.000
And I learned this also when you look at, and that's why I love coming from the place of children

34:54.000 --> 34:58.320
and adolescents as a psychotherapist for children and adolescents and working and researching on

34:58.320 --> 35:04.080
them. You learn so many things. And again, this is also what I want to add to IFS and to this whole

35:04.080 --> 35:10.080
ecology of awakening to meaning and all of that because you can learn so many things from them.

35:10.080 --> 35:21.520
I mean, Rodgers, Carl Rodgers, he was a school counselor, guidance guide. And you learned

35:21.520 --> 35:30.240
so well from developmental psychologists. Like when you take Piaget or other development psychologists

35:30.560 --> 35:35.440
Mahler or even Winnicott, when you have this kid, let's say it's two or three years old,

35:35.440 --> 35:41.600
right? And it has to learn this normative developmental task of separation, the modern infant

35:41.600 --> 35:48.960
separation. And in psychoanalytic theory, you would call, what it needs to is it has to have this,

35:50.080 --> 35:56.480
how would they call this object, like the doll?

35:57.440 --> 36:00.720
There's the, it's a transitional object.

36:00.720 --> 36:05.840
Transitional object, exactly. They have the transitional objects. I only had the German name

36:05.840 --> 36:13.600
for it. And it's a serious play. It's a catalyst. It's this imaginal thing that they involved in

36:13.600 --> 36:20.000
so that they can understand. And I think this is where it comes together, is that how can I have

36:20.000 --> 36:27.760
my mother's love, while at the same time, be able to differentiate, right? So you bring in

36:27.760 --> 36:34.480
the spirit of the mother of the caregiver, into this liminal space, and I would say into the

36:34.480 --> 36:39.840
playground, when we talk about this, when we talk about this play. And Winnicott would too.

36:39.840 --> 36:47.200
Yes, exactly. And I would, and this is where I would want to add Vygotsky to, right? Yes.

36:47.200 --> 36:51.600
Yeah. I love what you're doing here. You're bringing Vygotsky and Winnicott together

36:51.600 --> 36:56.320
with the imaginal. Please go, go on. Yes. And I think it's so important because

36:56.960 --> 37:02.880
what it does is that the doll or the transitional object that I'm playing with, what I do is I

37:02.880 --> 37:11.120
immerse into, into something that, that catches me, that is outside of my faculties. At the same

37:11.120 --> 37:14.880
time, it's in me and it grips me. And I think where Vygotsky comes in is that

37:15.920 --> 37:21.680
it's, it's this, the zone of proximal development. I think where we really transform and develop

37:21.680 --> 37:30.960
is this imaginal space, because it is between this overload and the under load. It's between

37:30.960 --> 37:37.200
the infinite and the finite. And that's why I think it's into essay, right? So it's my interest

37:37.200 --> 37:43.600
that guides me, that guides me into this imaginal, liminal space where I can, where I can have,

37:43.600 --> 37:49.040
you know, have the cake and eat it too, right? So I have the spirit of the caregiver at the same

37:49.040 --> 37:54.080
time I have the spirit of individuation. And this only can happen when I have this catalyst,

37:54.080 --> 38:00.480
this, in this sense, transitional object or the serious play. And I think interest is such a

38:00.480 --> 38:06.400
wonderful marker. And what happens is that there's so interesting research, I'm sure you know about,

38:06.400 --> 38:13.280
about private speech, right? So when you, and I think, again, this is where IFS comes into play.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.800
It's this dialogical practice. Now, what, what developmental psychologists

38:17.360 --> 38:24.320
talk about when you talk about private speech or self talk is that you can observe this behavior.

38:25.040 --> 38:31.680
A kid is in exactly in this liminal or, or imaginal space or in the zone of proximal

38:31.680 --> 38:39.360
development when it starts to talk to itself, but not internally, they talk loudly to themselves.

38:39.360 --> 38:43.440
Yes. Yes. They

38:43.440 --> 38:44.160
have to talk aloud to

38:45.440 --> 38:50.320
exactly. And what I think what happens is that we, we, we, we, we complexify, we

38:50.880 --> 38:54.560
particularly raise, we individual way, no, sorry, not individual but

38:54.560 --> 39:00.800
individual in a sense, but you know, differentiate in a sense. And what we do is then by this,

39:02.480 --> 39:07.600
we learn how to internalize those voices, let's say of the caregiver or the parent,

39:08.400 --> 39:14.640
and then we talk to ourselves. And I think this aspect of dialogical self is so important.

39:15.280 --> 39:20.480
And this is actually where development happens. And I think IFS, and I would say now two things

39:20.480 --> 39:30.800
about this. In one sense, IFS helps us through this inner dialogical self process. At the same

39:30.800 --> 39:38.160
time, I think IFS can still also learn from the practice of children and adolescents and enhance

39:38.160 --> 39:44.320
its own methodology. And that's why I think it's so important to bring in back those aspects of

39:44.640 --> 39:50.640
of childhood and adolescence too. So yeah, I'm sorry, I shut up now. So what do you do?

39:50.640 --> 39:55.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was beautiful. First of all, I'm going to have to

39:55.600 --> 40:00.720
remember to cite you on this, this bridging between you made between the imaginal and then

40:00.720 --> 40:05.200
transitional object and Winnecott, and then integrating that with Bogotsky. And of course,

40:05.200 --> 40:08.560
when the child starts to talk to themselves, that's how they develop metacognition,

40:08.560 --> 40:13.520
exactly essential for essential for rationality. And I think that and for self direction,

40:13.520 --> 40:19.680
long term planning, all of that stuff, even sense of self is modified significantly.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.400
I think that's right. I think the fact that I have a book, I haven't read it yet,

40:25.120 --> 40:31.440
a person looking at self talk. That's another name for the private speech, right? And the

40:31.440 --> 40:38.480
fact that we devote so much time for it means it probably has some very powerful adaptive

40:38.480 --> 40:44.240
functionality. And yet we don't investigate it. We treat it as noise or silliness or some bad habit.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.840
This is because we're bound up to the buffered self that Charles Taylor's talked about. We're

40:49.840 --> 40:55.440
bound to the monadic self. We don't realize, no, no, talking to yourself is like, you will kind

40:55.440 --> 41:00.880
of go insane if you don't do that. I imagine there might be some people who transcend to a

41:01.840 --> 41:06.720
witness consciousness. But I think of Castaway and I think of Wilson and how powerful Wilson

41:06.720 --> 41:15.280
became, right? And the profound grief, a spoiler, by the way, the profound grief that

41:16.000 --> 41:24.320
Tom Hanks's character has when he loses Wilson. And I think all of that is just

41:24.640 --> 41:32.400
so pregnant with something that is deeply culturally relevant, significant, pertinent to

41:32.400 --> 41:37.360
addressing the meaning crisis. Because I'll just make a quick proposal to you. I think part of

41:37.360 --> 41:45.200
what drives the meaning crisis is this notion of the monadic self, the single static substance

41:45.200 --> 41:52.240
self. And because that drives us into a kind of nominalism, it drives us into a radical

41:52.240 --> 42:00.000
self other adversarial kind of processing. It's an important driver. And it makes us resistant

42:00.000 --> 42:04.560
to alternative states of consciousness, because they are seen merely as deviants from the true

42:05.360 --> 42:12.640
self or something like that. And so I think I'm proposing to you that I think IFS and related

42:13.360 --> 42:18.560
practices, you know, there's, you know, empty chair therapy. Yes. There's ally work. And I'm

42:18.640 --> 42:25.440
talking a lot with Barnaby about this, right? I think all of these things are attempts to both

42:25.440 --> 42:30.880
bottom up from practice, real transformative practice and top down from theory, provide us with

42:30.880 --> 42:38.160
a significant and rich alternative to the monadic self. I absolutely agree. I think this whole idea

42:38.160 --> 42:47.600
of monad is difficult. Because I think it's also bound to this idea of having and being in the

42:47.680 --> 42:52.640
having. Oh, yes. And I think this is much about, yeah, it's modal confusion all the way through.

42:52.640 --> 43:00.720
It's modal confusion. And this and being trapped in the having mode, I think is one of the most

43:00.720 --> 43:06.880
important drivers of the meaning crisis. And again, now we can circle back to what I, how I, you know,

43:06.880 --> 43:17.440
in my own biography, saw how not only the the bad place that we are in, but also how IFS played

43:17.440 --> 43:24.240
in into this. So, and again, I think there are two ways now to where we can connect to the

43:24.240 --> 43:30.800
meaning crisis again. And one is via the mental health crisis in adolescence and the in the

43:30.800 --> 43:35.120
meaning crisis in adolescence. And we can talk about this in a second. And the other one is,

43:35.680 --> 43:43.520
again, this missing anthropology that I see in modern human science, and to related fields like

43:43.520 --> 43:49.040
medicine, psychiatry and psychotherapy, etc. And I think it's devastatingly contributing to the

43:49.040 --> 43:55.840
meaning crisis. And I saw this. And again, I see this in practice. And also in my research,

43:55.840 --> 44:00.960
and because there we have these deep problems with the current notions and our theoretical

44:00.960 --> 44:09.200
notions of of psychopathology, that's one, but also as well with this evidence based translation

44:09.200 --> 44:16.720
into into treatment. And, and there are several reasons that we can, you know, have have a whole,

44:16.720 --> 44:22.400
you know, podcast on this alone, but they're like, understanding illness is something

44:23.040 --> 44:29.440
as symptom aggregates, which is, you know, a deception or, again, the ignorance of non-urgidicity,

44:29.440 --> 44:35.600
right? So independent, assuming independent events, then committing ecological fallacies,

44:35.600 --> 44:43.120
right? The generalizability to individual problem. There are like deviation from protocols. If you

44:43.120 --> 44:47.600
if you deviate from the protocol, which is actually only protocol for randomized control trial,

44:47.600 --> 44:53.040
then it's, it's not, you know, it's bad practice or pseudoscience. And there, there are plethora

44:53.040 --> 44:57.600
of problems, which I again, I would say it's a lack of proposition and non propositional knowing.

44:58.240 --> 45:04.720
So by reducing, again, I'm not, I'm not saying or advocating that evidence based is wrong or

45:04.720 --> 45:09.840
bad. I want to be clear about this. I think evidence. Yeah, I get and you get that. I think we

45:09.840 --> 45:16.560
have to go beyond this notion of non propositional, of propositional and bring back all those other

45:16.560 --> 45:22.080
piece you talk about into this. And this is where I really see this landscape that it's missing. And

45:22.080 --> 45:28.080
it's, and it's, it is deeply problematic because we have this dehumanized anthropology. And

45:28.080 --> 45:35.840
it's so interesting. Roland May talks about this and the discovery of being, he actually,

45:35.840 --> 45:42.320
he points to the behavior modification therapies. And by training, I am a behavioral therapist.

45:42.320 --> 45:46.240
So I have deep sympathy for that. I think there was a lot of wisdom in it, because there is,

45:46.240 --> 45:53.120
it's embodied, you do things, you experience things. So, but what he wonderfully points out is that

45:53.120 --> 45:58.560
especially in those types, we have this, we have this missing anthropology, we actually don't have

45:58.560 --> 46:04.400
a conception of men, of human beings. So, and I think this is deeply, deeply difficult. And now,

46:04.400 --> 46:09.360
I don't know if you know this, John, but what happens right now in the field of bioethics is

46:09.360 --> 46:15.920
that there is a return to phenomenology, actually. Oh, that's good news. That's really, really

46:15.920 --> 46:22.560
interesting. There is this philosopher. He's called Frederick Sveneos. He's a, he's Swedish.

46:23.120 --> 46:28.160
And he has this book, even it's called Phenomenological Bioethics. And it's so interesting,

46:28.160 --> 46:34.560
because there are several scholars and people in this academic field that argue now for even a

46:34.560 --> 46:41.920
definition of illness, being defined as a meaning crisis, as a crisis. Oh, wow. Yes. And that's so

46:41.920 --> 46:48.320
interesting. It's even called illness as, and now listen to the language as an unhome-like being in

46:48.320 --> 46:57.360
the world. DSEs, like going back to the etymology of the original word. Yes. So, fortunately,

46:57.360 --> 47:02.240
this happens. But I think all those technological advancements, and we know this, you talk about

47:02.240 --> 47:10.800
this all the time, that they, the technological changes happen before the meaning crisis and

47:10.800 --> 47:16.160
et cetera. So there is this whole disenchantment that runs through this modernity, also runs through

47:16.160 --> 47:22.640
medicine and psychotherapy, et cetera. So I think this is what I'm really concerned about. And again,

47:22.640 --> 47:30.960
meaning is, so what we can, the lesson that we can get out of is that meaning is not an epiphenomenon.

47:30.960 --> 47:37.600
It's not easily dispensed with. It's crucial. It's necessary, even from a bioethical standpoint,

47:37.600 --> 47:44.960
right? And again, because we're more than just a sum of, you know, cogs and gear wheels and

47:44.960 --> 47:52.080
this mechanistic, reductionistic thing. And now there's Thomas Fuchs. He's actually a professor

47:52.080 --> 47:58.320
of phenomenological psychiatry. He has this Carl Yaspas. He's a professor for Carl Yaspas in

47:58.400 --> 48:02.880
Heidelberg, I think. He makes this. Oh, I love. Yeah, he makes this wonderful point that medicine

48:02.880 --> 48:10.480
is actually a relational medicine is relational. It's a relational, I don't know what to call

48:10.480 --> 48:18.320
science, but a practice. It's a relational practice. So. Wow. Who is that second person? Does he have

48:18.320 --> 48:26.880
a book or Thomas Fuchs? He has lots of books. Oh, I think he even has one in English. He publishes

48:26.880 --> 48:32.320
a lot in German, but there is one. I will forward it to you or I can look it up in a second. Thomas

48:32.320 --> 48:39.360
Fuchs. Really interesting. I had the privilege to talk to him once in a conference. So, yeah,

48:39.360 --> 48:46.080
it's, I mean, it is there, but it's still concerning. And so to me, to me, it was, again,

48:46.080 --> 48:52.000
by gravity to link my work to the meaning crisis and to IFS is that to me, it was clear from the

48:52.000 --> 48:58.160
get go from the beginning that we're not only in a funerary predicament, but also in the spiritual

48:58.160 --> 49:04.080
one. And yeah, obviously due to our affinity and it's related to that, but there is this deep

49:04.080 --> 49:09.120
spiritual deprivation that we have. And you see this when you work. I mean, I worked in oncology.

49:09.920 --> 49:14.000
Meaning is really, really important. And even the evidence based practice,

49:14.560 --> 49:20.240
you have meaning centered psychotherapy that is actually you have efficacy right there. So it's

49:20.240 --> 49:28.080
actually Victor Frankl's logotherapy revisited and done for oncology. It's done by Breitbart,

49:28.080 --> 49:33.920
his called, he's a wonderful researcher. And it's getting there. And again, working with adolescence

49:33.920 --> 49:38.720
and especially those auto line types and in this crisis center that I'm working with is that

49:39.360 --> 49:42.800
it's so salient. It's so present. And it's so

49:43.760 --> 49:52.640
obvious that we are lacking this how we meet a person. And, and IFS helps me there to to again to

49:52.640 --> 49:59.520
meet and not to reduce it to some, I mean, obviously a model is always prone to reductionism, and I

49:59.520 --> 50:06.640
can reduce you to your protectors or managers or exiles to, but it helps me if done correctly again,

50:07.600 --> 50:13.920
I think it helps me to, to connect to the human being again. And, and this is where I see IFS

50:13.920 --> 50:18.240
helping because John, ultimately what I think, and let's see what do you think about this?

50:18.240 --> 50:23.040
I'm sorry, if I'm talking that much. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're great. Keep going.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.360
Ultimately, what I see what is happening is that

50:29.520 --> 50:36.480
this momentum of healing in especially experience in IFS, but I think it goes beyond IFS. I

50:36.480 --> 50:40.560
think IFS is just the proxy. It's a placeholder for what is happening is there.

50:41.440 --> 50:50.480
What happens is that agape heals. I see it as a deep agape love that happens. And I see this

50:51.440 --> 50:57.680
in therapy interpersonally, right, this, this, this horizontal axis you're talking about. But I

50:57.680 --> 51:04.960
also see it in the, within the model itself in those, in this, in those technical steps

51:04.960 --> 51:11.680
you do, especially for example, you talk about the Socratic shift, right. And, and I want to propose

51:11.680 --> 51:18.560
that before we do the Socratic shift, we need the process of validation. I can't get you to change

51:19.200 --> 51:24.720
and to into the state of a poria. I mean, I could, but it's only, maybe it's not long lasting,

51:24.720 --> 51:31.760
I get back into this attractive state after a while. But if I really am with a part, I am with

51:31.760 --> 51:36.960
a partner, it's like being with a part, right? It's like I validate you. Validating means that

51:36.960 --> 51:43.680
you are valid. Your whole reason, your raison d'être, the reason of being, it's, it's valid. You,

51:43.680 --> 51:49.680
you have a reason to be there. You're functioning, you're, you're framing whatever you do. It's,

51:49.680 --> 51:54.480
it's so important that you get acknowledged because what I think, I think I want to propose

51:54.480 --> 52:01.600
to you, John, that we do the Socratic shift a little bit later. So before we do the Socratic

52:01.600 --> 52:08.640
shift, we validate, because if we don't do this, we get into again, the having mode, and then it's

52:08.640 --> 52:17.360
again the court, not the courtyard, but the courtroom of debate. It's not the courtyard of, of the

52:17.360 --> 52:25.680
dialogue, but it's the courtroom of debate. Because if I just spill this over you, and I, and I, and I,

52:28.800 --> 52:34.160
it's, it's, well, well, let me reply. Yes, yes, please. Okay. So first of all,

52:36.000 --> 52:42.800
to your point, a couple minutes past that, you know, propositional tyranny has infected medicine,

52:42.800 --> 52:46.560
and we've lost, we've lost touch with the non propositional knowing, and that's where a lot of

52:46.560 --> 52:52.640
the meaning participation occurs. And the meaning participation is a fundamental being together,

52:52.640 --> 52:58.000
being with, and that's part of what participatory knowing is, knowing by being with.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.200
Exactly. And so all of that, I think, I think that tracks very well. It goes to the work I'm

53:03.200 --> 53:11.280
doing with Terry Dentry about trying to open up what we mean by health and, and, and medicine.

53:11.280 --> 53:17.680
And so I'm completely constant with that. I think the thing you're, you're saying right now, I, I take,

53:18.480 --> 53:25.280
I mean, it is, it is exemplary constructive criticism. I think you're right. I, and this goes

53:25.280 --> 53:29.680
to what Seth Allison was talking about, where, where you're talking about Agapa, he talks about

53:29.680 --> 53:34.640
integrating attachment theory and IFS, and you actually have attachment relationships with

53:34.640 --> 53:40.800
your parts. And you have to bring in sort of EFT, Emotion Focus Therapy kind of techniques

53:40.800 --> 53:45.120
to get into proper relation. And then I said to him, once you're doing that, what I've done,

53:45.120 --> 53:48.640
though, is I've also brought, and maybe this is the bridging, I sort of bring some of the

53:48.640 --> 53:53.520
Socratic into my interaction with my parts, because I try to get them to recognize their

53:53.520 --> 53:59.920
function. I try to recognize, get them to, I try to enhance their own self-awareness and their own,

53:59.920 --> 54:05.520
therefore, responsibility to themselves. So they go from just enacting their functionality to

54:05.520 --> 54:13.280
reflecting on it, which also opens up spaces of possibility for them, which I think is.

54:14.080 --> 54:18.000
And that's great. I learned that actually from you. And I, and I actually,

54:18.560 --> 54:23.440
now I'm trying to incorporate it more into my practice. I love this Socratic move and shift.

54:23.440 --> 54:28.560
Actually, when you, when you said that in, I think it was episode eight in, in, after Socrates,

54:28.560 --> 54:35.280
it's like, whoa, yeah, I've never done this, you know, do the Socratic shift on the part. It's like,

54:35.280 --> 54:42.000
wow. Yeah. But I think that you and Seth are correct that it's premature to do that unless the

54:42.000 --> 54:48.800
attachment issues and the, and the, and the, and the reciprocal recognition has taken place. The

54:48.800 --> 54:55.440
being with has to be in place, right? In order to shift you out of the having mode, in order to open

54:55.440 --> 55:02.320
you up for the real possibility of genuine Socratic practice, as opposed to just using or having a

55:02.400 --> 55:06.720
Socratic technique, that's how I would put it. And I think you are exactly right about that.

55:06.720 --> 55:11.360
And I've been trying to incorporate that in to my practice, and we are going to try and see how we

55:11.360 --> 55:17.680
can feed this in. We see the problem the Verveke Foundation faces is we, we, one of our stead

55:17.680 --> 55:24.160
past principles is we are not offering therapy because we are not properly vetted or certified

55:24.160 --> 55:29.440
to do that. We have, we have affiliate relationships with therapists who can come in if people

55:29.520 --> 55:35.680
hit crisis or distress, but we, our practices are not therapy and trying to figure out how to get

55:35.680 --> 55:39.760
that what you just said, which I agree. Do you see the problem we're struggling with? Absolutely.

55:39.760 --> 55:45.680
Right. It's like what you said, I think is deeply right, but we will not offer therapy

55:45.680 --> 55:52.160
for principled reasons, right? I think then genuine bioethical reasons, we will not do that. And so

55:52.160 --> 55:57.120
there's a struggle here. And maybe, you know, off-camera, you know, you and Chris and Taylor

55:57.120 --> 56:04.560
and I could talk about maybe a way of doing this that could, could pick up on, I think, the very

56:04.560 --> 56:10.000
legitimate point you just made while still respecting our ethical requirements of not

56:10.000 --> 56:16.400
engaging in therapy. And can I add to that? I want to compliment you for that. I think

56:17.280 --> 56:22.080
it is actually, even from, from the ethos, it's the right or the tell us, it's the right move.

56:22.960 --> 56:27.200
I think, and this is again, the problem that I have and that I was trying to allude to when I,

56:27.200 --> 56:32.800
when I talk about evidence-based practices in psychotherapy, I think it's, it's, it's a fatal

56:32.800 --> 56:39.440
mistake. And again, contributing to the meaning crisis, if we pathologize everything, not everything

56:39.440 --> 56:46.400
has to be a psychotherapeutic modality and intervention or technique. Now, obviously,

56:46.400 --> 56:52.560
it can inform our practices, but I, but for it to be pathological, I think it's way more important.

56:53.360 --> 56:58.400
So I think therapy can help there, the techniques. And to be fair, the Socratic move that I'm

56:58.400 --> 57:03.760
proposing, IFS accounts for it. Now, this is when you do the integration, what you do when you talk

57:03.760 --> 57:08.720
to the exile, for example, and then you have this unburdening, and now we don't have to go into the

57:08.720 --> 57:14.320
details right now, but you invite back the protector. And now you do do Socratic move,

57:14.320 --> 57:20.080
now you hopefully do the aporian. And you say, now how can you contribute to the,

57:20.080 --> 57:25.840
to the state after the alleviation of pain and suffering, after the unburdening? Now, again,

57:25.840 --> 57:30.640
I still think that you're right. And I think, and I, and I love that you're doing the pathological

57:30.640 --> 57:39.920
work because again, I think it's, I'm, I'm actually really afraid of the fact that we,

57:39.920 --> 57:44.080
that we are pathologizing everything, especially when it comes to adolescence. And

57:45.280 --> 57:49.360
you know, we talked about the archetype of the adolescent, and we should talk about this maybe

57:49.360 --> 57:57.440
another time, but it's the idiosyncrasies of, of adolescents are so important and crucial.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.880
And we tend to, I mean, not only with regards to adolescents, we tend to pathologize a lot of

58:02.880 --> 58:10.320
things. So I'm deeply grateful for the work of the Viveki Foundation, but not just, you know, being

58:11.440 --> 58:17.600
psychoterapeutical, but it's more pathological. I think it's a wonderful and noble thing to do, John.

58:19.120 --> 58:26.160
Thank you. But and you, of course, are coming back because I do want to talk about the archetype

58:26.160 --> 58:31.840
of the adolescent and how it fits. I can talk about everything for like, or anything for like hours

58:31.840 --> 58:36.320
with you. Well, honestly, I think talking with you and having other people hear what you have to

58:36.320 --> 58:47.280
say, I think is extremely valuable. Yeah, I mean, so I just, yeah, I do want to pick your brain

58:47.280 --> 58:52.480
and your colleagues about that particular problem. I, we don't, I'm not asking us to solve it here,

58:52.480 --> 58:56.560
and this is not the right place to try and solve it. But I do think, you know, there's a way of,

58:56.560 --> 59:02.240
I want to recognize, I want to recognize and be responsible to the truth you've articulated,

59:02.240 --> 59:06.880
while still, still being governed by the principle, the ethical principle that I've

59:06.880 --> 59:11.440
articulated. And that's a tricky thing to do. And trying to figure out how to do that is

59:11.440 --> 59:17.520
something I'd like to talk about. Yeah, it's a dance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's,

59:17.520 --> 59:24.160
it's a very careful dance. I want to, I want to bring back a little bit about, because you've,

59:24.160 --> 59:30.160
you've said it a few times and it's deeply, deeply impactful to me. And we had to talk about other

59:30.160 --> 59:34.720
things. I wasn't able to pick it up, but I want to pick it up now. Yes. So you've often invoked,

59:34.720 --> 59:41.280
you know, and I think the self is metaxu. This is the ancient Greek word for between. I think the

59:41.280 --> 59:48.960
self, well, I should be careful. This is Highland's interpretation of what the, the central argument

59:48.960 --> 59:54.560
of Plato was, which is we are the relationship between finitude and ultimacy, between finitude

59:54.560 --> 01:00:02.080
and transcendence. And if we, if we try to identify with either one of the poles, and if we lose the

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.200
polarity and try to identify with either one of the poles, we either fall into cert, into

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:15.840
servile despair, or we, we go through inflationary hubris and spirituality in the, in the proper

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.520
sense, in the, or at least sorry, that was inappropriate. Spirituality in the Platonic

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:30.800
sense that would be proper to Plato's framework is that we enable, we induce and educate, we draw

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:36.880
out and we also transform people so that they are capable of holding that tonus, that creative

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.520
tension between that, like a profound opponent processing that gives them the most profound

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:49.920
optimal grip on their fundamental orientation reality is you have to get this opponent processing

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:58.240
between your finitude and your transcendence, right, between, right, how you are as a, as a single

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:04.800
being and the relationship you have to ultimacy, but that you are that tonus. You're like the

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.040
tension of the bow as Heraclitus talks about the logos of the, of the psyche, right? And that,

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.520
and that, that is kind of the deepest, most profound opponent processing and that is the

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.520
source of our deepest, most profound optimal gripping, our most profound orientation.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.120
And I want, I want to know it because you've invoked the, that, those, that pair multiple

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:34.080
times in our conversation. How does that proposal land to you that that's a deep thing? I'm about

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:39.520
to teach a course for the Reveki Foundation on literature and the meaning crisis and wrestling

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.680
with these books in which you see human beings wrestling with the meaning crisis and it's

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.920
precisely the way the meaning crisis throws this tonus into WAP and either drives people into despair

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.920
or drives them into inflation. The heart of darkness is a, is a classic example or Moby Dick,

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.880
right? Do you think, sorry, this was a long preamble, but I hope it's landing. Do you think that

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:13.200
IFS, especially because it's doing the imaginal, it's getting us related to the transitional

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.600
object, it's moving us out of the matter itself, getting us to inhabit and be a Metaxu, a pure,

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:26.640
a purely relational being in the deep relation to relationality, which is ultimate. Do you think

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:34.720
IFS in there for can help us with this fundamental commitment to our true humanity, which is the

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.280
tonus, the creative tension, the opponent processing between finitude and transcendence? Do you think

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:50.720
that is that just too far afield or is it a good situation? Because to me, it seems that a big part

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.360
of the meaning crisis is the way we lose the polarity and we get attracted to either one of

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:03.840
these poles in either nihilism or narcissism and they're not opposites. They are two sides of the

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:12.320
same coin. Yes. Wow, what a question. I hope I can be fair to this question because obviously I'm

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:20.400
not, I cannot speak for the whole IFS community, but only from my perspective of it. But I think IFS

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.800
has the potential to do so. Now, again, with the monad, I think, or the having mode, I don't think

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:33.360
it's the panacea. You said it yourself. It cannot be a panacea. It has to be embedded in an ecology,

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.440
and no matter what method, technique, paradigm, whatever you want to use,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:51.680
there are ways to do it good or better and worse. So I think it has the potential to do so.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.080
And I think if IFS is done properly with this whole sapiential framework around it,

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:07.440
then I think it's so powerful. But I've also seen people, again, being trapped in the having mode

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:14.480
at the same time using IFS and do the spiritual bypassing. So I think it's a matter of, it's the

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:22.960
how-ness, how we do things that matters more than the what-ness, right? Well, you know, that's a

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:30.080
standard definition, or at least the distinction between knowledge, which is a what, and wisdom is

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:40.640
the how. Yeah. So again, to be, yeah, I think if done properly, it has, because I think of this

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:47.200
essentially agopic element to it. And I really think, and this is what I see happening in therapy,

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:57.600
John, there is this magical moment happening if you, and I'm at, in this time, I'm really proud

01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:04.080
to be part of it, to participate in it. When you, when, and I'm, and I think I'm privileged to witness

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:11.360
healing at times. Now, and this is so interesting, I don't consider myself as, as the one that

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:19.520
heals. I only participate in it. And it's so interesting because Plato has this critique of

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:30.560
therapy, a theon, and anything, because it relates to this, to God, right, to theon. And, but, but

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:37.600
therapy, a theon, I think it's, if you properly do it, what therapy means, or theon means, or

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:44.400
therapy means in this case is that, in its deep sense, etymologically, is it's your certain,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.760
your servant of God. Now, I think what happens in those moments in the therapy room is when

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:56.800
you witness healing is that you are part of something bigger, what you're relating to. And,

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.640
and, and it's a beautiful thing that happens. And that's why there, you can invoke the

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:07.440
anesthesis, right, the, the perception, the aesthetics, these, and that's why I think that

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.600
beauty is the, as the primary thing is absolutely correct. It has this beautiful, elegant thing

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:20.480
to it. And, and, and what IFAS brings here is this moment of not only of logos, where the good,

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:26.240
the true, and the beautiful, I think where, where they are one is actually the logos, I think in

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.800
meaning is where the good, the true, and the beautiful are actually, you cannot, they're not

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:35.760
the same thing, but at the same time, you cannot, you know, they're not separated, right? And, and,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:41.920
and, and this, this wonderful, you said that IFAS is platonic and Jungian, I would also say it's

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.920
Augustinian, in the sense that it's, it's agape, right? This moment of love that's happening is

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:57.760
what transcends both. And this is what Jung also referred to is that when it's, or Rogers too,

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:04.240
in the sense that when, when good, when you need a soul, there is this potential transformation

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:09.360
for both of them. And I often have this, have this feeling that when I go out, you know, when I

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.480
have my session, when they're done, I am changed myself. Yeah. Yeah. So I hope I was fair to your,

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:23.600
to your question. You're more than fair. You brought, I really, really enjoy talking with you.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:30.560
This is really just catching fire. Thanks for me. So I thought, thought what you said was great.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.320
We're, we're coming to a close. I'd like to bring up one question. And then I want to,

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.520
but first I want to propose what we could talk about next time. First of all, I think I want to

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:43.440
give you space and time to talk about the archetype of the adolescent. I think that's

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.880
important. Yeah, that will be, and I think that, I think it's essential. Yeah, necessary, especially

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.480
for the mental health crisis, especially for the meeting crisis. I think, I think you're

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.160
bang on about that. The second thing I want to talk to you about is now that we broached,

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:03.280
you invoked Agape, you invoked the possibility of something bigger and God, the logos. I mean,

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.240
this has to do, and there's also Jung, and you know, the red book, and he has Philemon, and he has

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:13.840
these, these, these, these, you know what I'm talking about, and there's no good name for them. I

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:19.280
mean, Ralph calls them allies. And of course, I've had this experience, and I've been doing ally work,

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:24.640
and I'd like to hear, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not expecting you to be an expert on this or anything.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.480
I just want your reflections from an IFS. I've been asking Seth Allison about this and other people

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:35.440
about this. And we, so if we could talk about those two things, we'll talk about the, the, well,

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:39.920
that we got a triple A here, the archetype of the adolescent and the ally. If we could talk about

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.920
that next time, I would appreciate that. That would be great. Okay. And so thank you for that.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:51.360
Thank you. And what I'd like to talk to you about right now is our final point. And it, it's a

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:58.720
Socratic point, which means I hope it comes off as constructive. So I think all of, all of this is

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:07.200
very, very well said. And then a Socratic concern would be, and this is one of the critiques I've

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:18.400
had of sort of romanticism, right? Which is, how do we look for notice and ameliorate self-deception

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:23.920
that might arise in all of this work? Because pretending that there's no self-deception at

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:30.880
play in this, I think is foolish. And I seriously doubt that you would make, engage in that pretense.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:38.800
So how, so here, here's the concern. Within therapy, I understand you are beholding to the

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.000
goal of healing. And that is important. But given a lot of things we've said, and given that we're

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.960
trying to make connections outside of therapy, to pedagogy, and where there are deeper goals of,

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.240
you know, right relationship to reality and the true, the good and the beautiful, the virtue,

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:03.120
then this issue around self-deception, I think comes up. And I would like to know, and if you want,

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.760
if you want to bleed into the next, our next conversation to address this more, that's fine.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:14.480
But maybe just an initial concern. How do, and I mean, I mean it in that, I mean it in the

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:22.000
Platonic sense. How is rationality as the concern for self-deception, which can often mask as

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:34.880
self-transcendence, right? How is that concern properly, properly met? How can we be responsible

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.720
to that within an IFS practice? Is that a fair question? That's a very important question.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:50.080
I really have to think about it more deeply to give an appropriate answer. But I would say the

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:59.280
initial, the initial response would be, and this goes back to the question you had before,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:06.400
and I forgot to mention it because I also have critique for IFS. And I think now this comes

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:14.000
together, I think what IFS still can do better is to enhance the notion of something like

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:21.680
evil. And I think the ally work that you're alluding to and the archetypal work,

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:29.520
you know, the Hillman work, that is, I think that is still missing. Now, to be fair, IFS

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:36.000
is not one thing. This community has very diverse thinkers and there are, of course,

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.760
beautiful people that bring, that bring different aspects to it. But I would say to answer your

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:49.280
question is to address the self-deception is that I think it needs to be embedded within a system

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:58.080
of systems. And I think what we need to do in order to overcome self-deception is that

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:05.040
we cannot overlook the body. And I think this is very, very important. And there is this

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:12.400
brand of IFS, which is called Somatic IFS. Susan McConnell, she's wonderful. She's actually one

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:19.440
of those that close friends to Dick Schwartz who actually made the whole curriculum for the training

01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.720
of IFS. So she's a brilliant mind. And she has this book, I have Somatic Experience, I don't know

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:30.240
if you know this. I have it. Oh, awesome. She writes really poetically and beautifully. I think so,

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:37.600
the body work is needed. And this is, I think, something you know as a practitioner of Tai Chi

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:44.960
Chuan and Greg Kelly. And we need to bring back the body. But we also need feedback systems and

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:51.520
people can be feedback systems, right? So if I do this work alone, so I have to have a community

01:12:51.520 --> 01:13:03.760
to do so. And this witnessing of healing is, again, it's tenfold if you witness it in the

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.000
community of healing. And I was privileged or I'm privileged to experience that over and over again

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.160
and say what happens when a collective comes together. Now, I think there is also a danger,

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.240
right? And this is also what Jung talks about when he talks about being one and not a zero.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.880
It's like, okay, well, you have this or Nietzsche when he talks about the mass is going to one

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:33.840
direction, the ideological thing. So I really have to think about it.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:42.000
Well, I mean, it links what, so let's just say that that's your initial foray and we'll come back

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.840
to it next time. But what you said does connect with what you said before about IFS needs to be

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:54.720
situated within a sapiential framework and ecology of practices. But I like your invocation of,

01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:01.120
you know, Rafe Kelly's work, the stuff on embodiment. I think that is deeply appropriate.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:09.920
This is Marla Ponti that the body is really fundamental to keeping us anchored to the world

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:19.120
in a way that if we train the mind to properly listen, can act as, you know, a significant

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:25.040
counterbalance to spiritual bypassing and hubristic self-deception and other things.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.920
So let's pick that up then. We'll pick up that in addition to the archetype of the adolescent

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:44.560
and ally work. We can talk a little bit more about bringing Ratio, a logos in the in

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:51.280
rationality in the Socratic-Platonic sense into conversation with IFS. So I really look forward

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:59.200
to this. I love my guests. This was, first of all, just, wow, really catching fire. Love this,

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:07.360
love this. You have a brilliant and scintillating mind, and yet it is clear that it is connected to

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:14.160
your heart. And I just, just enjoyed that. I talk about, you know, how certain people taste,

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:22.560
right, like the way, a work of art, you know, you taste really wonderfully. So that, I really

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:28.960
appreciate that. But I'd like to give my guests, I'd like to give my guests the last word.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:38.800
Thank you, John. I deeply appreciate it. I don't know what to say. I'm grateful to be able to,

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.480
you know, to be talking to you. It's something that I've wanted now for years. And I think now

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:49.920
the time is right. And also, with regards to your viewers and followers,

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:59.360
I really think it's, it's, it's a kairos. I think we are at a pivotal point where things now come

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:09.920
together. And I want to thank you for everything you've done and you do. And I consider you a

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:15.680
really close friend. I mean, we haven't met personally yet. We can become that.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:22.880
Yes, I hope so too. And we are 10,000 kilometers apart. But I don't know if you know this, but

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:31.600
you are, your voice and your spirit is, you know, fills my home and life and work every day. So,

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:38.080
in a sense, you're, you know, very close to me on a daily basis. And to be able to participate in

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:45.440
this whole endeavor is I'm really, really grateful for. And I want to thank you for also allowing

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:50.160
and giving the platform to come together. So thank you for that, John.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:58.000
So we will speak again very soon. I would like that. I would love that, actually. Thank you.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.240
Hello, everyone. I'd like to announce a new course. I'm going to be teaching at Halcyon Academy.

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.440
It's called Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond. I'll talk in a minute about that very provocative title.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.640
First important things. It's going to be starting April 5th. It will be eight weeks,

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:21.920
not eight consecutive weeks, because I'm attending conferences, but it's all scheduled out. The link

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:30.960
to the home page for the course will be put in the notes to this promo. And each session will be

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:38.560
two hours. There'll be one hour of me doing a lecture and then one hour of Q&A. Now, there are

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:44.720
options you can purchase where you can attend the lecture live and participate in the live Q&A,

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:51.520
or you can also go through this course asynchronously and you can purchase it at that level if that

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:57.600
works better with your schedule and or your finances. I've done one of these courses before,

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:07.520
Beyond Nihilism, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I consider it, by all the feedback, a success,

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:15.760
and I very much wanted to follow it up, which gets me to the title. The Beyond was a way of

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:20.800
pointing to some continuity with the previous course, Beyond Nihilism, which is also available

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:28.800
asynchronously on Halkian, if you wish to take a look at that. I'm not assuming that people

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.960
have gone through Beyond Nihilism. The course Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond, is a standalone

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:41.680
course, but I've also structuring it so those people who have taken Beyond Nihilism will find

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.680
connection and continuity. That's a bit of a tricky thing to do as a teacher, but I do have quite a

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.720
bit of experience with doing that kind of thing for my many years of teaching at the university.

01:18:53.600 --> 01:19:00.320
So that's one reason for the title. Now, the other title is God and Beyond. What could possibly be

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:07.600
beyond God? What could that mean? That's just a silly contradiction, isn't it? Well, that's the

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:13.840
issue. That's the issue that the course is going to wrestle with. When we come into or try to enter

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:20.480
into a philosophically reflective and deep relationship with what we consider to be Ultimate

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:28.320
Reality, is that relationship best captured by what we think of when we think of God? Now,

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.800
what many of you will say to me is that there's many different possible meanings,

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:40.160
and that's exactly what this course will explore. But the idea that there is a somewhat standard

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:47.920
notion, Abrahamic notion, perhaps, of God is one we'll be making use of, and whether or not

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.720
that actually is the best way of understanding Ultimate Reality.

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:59.120
So in order to do that, we'll be taking a look at a bunch of thinkers. The one is Robert Carter

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:05.520
in his amazing book, The Nothingness Beyond God, and you can see the title of that book,

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:11.360
Resonating with the title of the course, in which he explores the work of Nishita from the Kyoto

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:18.400
School, which is somebody deeply influenced by both Heidegger and Zen. And of course, Heidegger

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:25.360
famously, in his famous critique of ontotheology, criticized that our standard notion of God as a

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:33.840
Supreme Being fundamentally misrepresents being itself, because being itself is no kind of individual

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:40.160
thing or being. And that's the no-thingness beyond God. If God is some kind of super thing,

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.720
then Ultimate Reality is a no-thing beyond that. And that was explored, of course,

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:49.680
by Nishita, making use of both Heidegger and Zen. And we want to enter into discussion about this.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.520
Please understand that this is a very exploratory thing. This course is helping me

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:01.680
do some deep thinking in dialogue with others who are coming in good faith and want to engage in

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.760
deep reflection and discussion in preparation for the next series I'm doing on the Philosophical

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:16.320
Silk Road. And so being part of the course is a way of participating in the contribution of

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:23.680
that project. We'll also be taking a look at the work of the Canadian atheist, Schellingbert,

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:30.240
especially in his book Evolutionary Religion, but we'll also be taking a look at all, at least,

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:35.520
be bringing in his book Religion and Religion After Science, and also talking about the

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.360
hiddenness argument. He is famous for being the author of the hiddenness argument,

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:47.120
which is considered a sort of new argument against the existence of a personal God. Now,

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:54.000
you may say, oh, an atheist. Be very careful. Schellingberg is not a typical atheist.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:03.440
Schellingberg is somebody who wants us to look at, take very seriously the possibility of ultimate

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:09.920
reality and very seriously what he calls a triple transcendence. That ultimate reality

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:17.600
is transcendent in being most real. And also, it's also, in some sense, most valuable, you know,

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:23.680
beyond the true, the good, and the beautiful, and also most transformative. And he thinks this

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:28.480
proposal that human beings, that there is such an ultimate reality, that human beings can enter

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:35.280
into a relationship with it and be transformed by it, is one that we should take very seriously,

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:41.600
but within a particular frame. He says he points to deep time, how science has discovered deep

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:48.560
time, billions of years in the past, billions of years in the future. The species has existed

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.480
for 200,000 years. We seem to be spiritually oriented from about 40,000 BCE. So we have all

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:02.160
of this going on, and yet we also have this deep future ahead of us. And he poses this question.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:11.440
He says, given the depth of the questions we're asking about ultimate reality, is it like

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:17.520
that we are mature enough as a species that we have got complete answers to this? When, of course,

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:23.200
we don't have complete answers about the nature of the atom, or that we don't have complete answers

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:28.720
about how disease works, or how the mind works, or how the body works. Isn't it presumptuous to

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:37.360
think that we have finished complete answers about ultimate reality? So he wants us to engage in

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:44.960
the reflect upon the proposal that we might be as a species, not individual, spiritually immature.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:54.480
And then he asks, what do we need to do in order to mature ourselves across time and across generations

01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:01.520
such that we could come into the kind of work that would give us

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:10.800
a plausible claim on getting an answer to that question of whether or not ultimate reality

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:16.960
has that triple transcendence for us. And I think this is a very profound idea, because I think the

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:24.400
deep time aspect of our reflections upon ultimate reality within standard axial age religion,

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:32.560
and philosophy has not been properly understood or taken into account. And so this is very

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:38.320
provocative. It opens us up and it, of course, allows science at the table. Now, of course,

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:43.120
he also criticizes, and this is what makes him so interesting, he also criticizes the atheists

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:50.320
who think they can come to a complete conclusion about ultimate reality from a framework that

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:58.720
is very plausibly one of spiritual immaturity. So we will be taking a look at that, and we'll be

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:06.720
looking at what happens if we adopt deep humility with respect to the question of ultimate reality,

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:12.400
God and beyond. What happens? What do we open ourselves up to? And what becomes really important

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:19.760
for him is the role, the aspirational role of imagination, especially in the imaginal sense.

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.520
We'll then be taking a look at the astonishing work of James Filler, who I will actually be

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.200
meeting in person in April. Unfortunately, his book is quite expensive, so instead we'll be reading

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.560
three papers where he makes the argument that the Neoplatonic tradition made an argument,

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:45.280
which is that ultimate reality is pure relationality rather than a substance. Now,

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.920
when he uses substance, he's ultimately meaning it in not just a Cartesian sense,

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:55.200
but in Aristotelian. Substance is our individual things that are considered to be able to exist

01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:01.760
independently and are the subjects of properties. They're the owner of properties,

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:08.320
and they enter into relations with other things. And so there are things from which

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.840
relations emerge. And Filler's arguments go to show that that seems to have things exactly

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.320
the wrong way around. It looks like relationality is ultimate, and the things emerge out of it.

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.680
And so, of course, this relationality is a no thing, because that's just what things emerge from.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.880
And this meshes, of course, with some of the fundamental arguments of Neoplatonism.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:39.680
And I think moving off of that thing-based substance ontology is a fundamental shift,

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:46.880
a new way of thinking profoundly and relating to ultimate reality that takes us into that space

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:54.960
of God and beyond. The final person is Bracken, whose book The Divine Matrix is written from a

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.440
Whiteheadian perspective, which I think is very important, because Whitehead, in some ways,

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.440
integrates that pure relationality with the dynamic view of the world given to us by science.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.560
But what he does is he takes a look, Bracken, at the Western traditions, reflections on ultimate

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:20.320
reality, and Eastern reflections, Taoism, Vedanta, Buddhism. And he is trying to propose

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.760
what we can see being held in common. And this, of course, is very much like a through line,

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:30.000
like the philosophical Silk Road. And he comes to some very interesting

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:38.240
conclusions from this argument about what ultimate reality is and how we could come to

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.280
a shared understanding. It doesn't mean we all will become Hindus, or we'll all become Buddhists,

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:48.240
or we'll all even become Whiteheadians, or that we will all become Christians or Jews.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.080
What he says is this gives us a shareable relationship to ultimate reality between people

01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:00.400
who talk about that ultimate reality as a God, and people like Taoists with the Tao,

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:05.440
or the Vedantas with Brahmin, or the Buddhists with Shunyata, who do not talk about ultimate

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:13.200
reality as God, but nevertheless consider it to be triply transcendent. And so this is all in

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:19.920
service of an observation that I have been sharing with a lot of the people that I enter

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:25.280
in deep discussion with, which is in response to the meaning crisis, there seems to be an advent

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.720
of the sacred taking place in many different parts of the world, different communities,

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:34.880
different philosophical currents. And I've just pointed to you a bunch. There's many,

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:42.560
many more that converge on this. People are fundamentally reframing our relationship to

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:48.640
ultimate reality. And I think this is a way of trying to give us a new way of living in

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:55.360
relationship to the sacred, which will offer people a living response to the problem of

01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:02.320
the meaning crisis. Now, this is all something I am proposing. And I am proposing that we discuss

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:09.600
it together. And you help me as much as I try to teach you that we discuss it together as we

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.560
try to wrestle with this question about ultimate reality, God and beyond. So I look forward to

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:23.440
seeing you in the course. As I said, the notes for both the date, which starts on April the 5th,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.400
and the link and how you can register will be found in the end, will contain the information

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:36.400
in the notes to this promo. So thank you very much. And I look forward to seeing you in ultimate

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:38.400
reality, God and beyond.
