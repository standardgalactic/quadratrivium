1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Humor is inherently multi-perspectival, multi-espectual, and dialogical.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,480
Same thing with tragedy, right?

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,720
So now here, again, like I did last time, I want to do this sort of semi-provocative

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,000
thing with you because I can deeply trust you, right?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,480
Cryptoguard to me is great evidence of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy into a

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,920
disclosure of how one can see the world the way Christ, the way Jesus did all, use my

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,920
language if that's okay.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Right.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,240
And we see humor clearly in Socrates.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,280
We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,440
We see it clearly, right, in many great sages, like Schwangse from the Taoist tradition is

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
just humor after humor after.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:01:10,400
I don't see it in the Bible.

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Welcome back to After Socrates, episode 18, and we are continuing the series within the

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,880
series where I am being joined and helped by my dear friend and collaborator, Christopher

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,680
Master Petro, in which we are trying to exemplify dialectic into the logos, well, especially

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,040
the logos, and the Socratic orientation.

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:43,920
And we are also trying to bring this discussion about the logos within the logos from both

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
the Socratic-Platonic perspective and the Christian perspective by putting Socrates and

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Cryptoguard into deep dialogue.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,120
And last time we had, I thought, well, I think it really caught fire, and for me of the three

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,080
we've done so far, that one was the most dialogical, and the logos was there.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,840
It was in the other two, but almost completely last time, and you're nodding in agreement.

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,360
And it was around, I think, a very important reflection about irony and paradox and following

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,760
the logos.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,280
And so, Chris is back, and he is going to take us into something that follows on that,

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,800
that he's something he really wants to bring into this conversation, and I think it's really

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
opportune.

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
So, Chris, welcome.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
All right.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Thanks, John.

32
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,600
So we've talked a lot about irony, and we've made side-long gestures back and forth to

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,960
humor quite a lot when we've been talking about Socrates and Cryptoguard.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,920
Both of them are very funny.

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Whatever else they are, they're very, very funny.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,680
The role of humor in Philea Sophia, I think, is very underappreciated.

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
It's not an accessory.

38
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
It's not an affectation.

39
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,200
There's some necessity about it.

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
There's something actually important.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's something we needed.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,680
Yeah, this is a point that Anderson Todd has made to me previously as well, so please

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
be careful.

44
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Right.

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Right.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,840
And so, I have with me, this is a really great book, my dear friend Patrick Kelly put

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,040
me onto this, The Humor of Cryptoguard.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
It's an anthology.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,320
It's edited by Thomas Oden.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,760
It's basically like a compendium, a compilation.

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,560
You show the audience.

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,960
The Humor of Cryptoguard.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,520
And it's basically a compilation of excerpts from Cryptoguard's body of work that, at least

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,320
in the estimation of Thomas Oden, are funny.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,440
Either are about humor.

57
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,600
Most of them aren't about humor.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,680
Most of them are just funny because he's very funny.

59
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
And in his irony, he's very funny because he's often indirect.

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,040
He makes very clever veiled references.

61
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,520
One of the reasons that he was such a find, he was such a fine polemicist, is polemicist

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
the term?

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
I think that's right.

64
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Polemicist.

65
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,720
One of the reasons he was such a fine polemicist is that he was, in fact, some people have

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,560
remarked about him that his writing actually reached its absolute pinnacle when he was

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:22,360
immersed in a polemic and when he was trying to undress his opponent.

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,200
He was really quite, he had a wicked sense of humor and an ironical one at that.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
And anyway, so I wanted to read something I think is quite apropos.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,160
It's more, I think, insightful than it is funny, but you see the traces of the humor

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
too.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,320
And it has, we've been talking about this idea of following the logos, how Cryptoguard

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,360
takes up the task.

74
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,080
He takes it up with a slightly different focus in his crosshairs.

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,200
But fundamentally, he takes up the task of following the logos from Socrates.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,520
Right road, wrong direction, that's the title given to this excerpt.

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,840
And the question given to it by the editor is, does it represent a bold advance in the

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,160
spirit to master arguments for the existence of God?

79
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
It's like, oh God, God's existence.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,360
What are we talking about?

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,320
Any qualification that claims to render the God directly knowable is undoubtedly a milestone.

82
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,160
But a milestone on the way of approximation, registering a retrogression rather than progress.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,840
It marks a movement away from the paradox, not toward it, missing the point of Socrates

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,240
and Socratic ignorance.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,440
Close attention should be paid to this, lest the same thing happen in the spiritual world

86
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,480
that happened to the traveler who asked an Englishman if the road led to London and was

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,800
told, yes it does.

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,000
But he never did arrive in London because the Englishman had omitted to mention that he

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,120
needed to turn about in as much as he was going away from London.

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,680
The metanoia, the right turning around, the reorientation.

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,160
I want to share a parable, and I think it's the right word because it's a story that undermines

92
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,520
itself as a narrative, by Kierkegaard, and I think it's telling that there's very few

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,560
people, Plato's clearly one, Jesus of Nazareth is the maestro of the parable, but Kierkegaard

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,640
is capable of the parable.

95
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,160
He tells this story about a bunch of geese that file into a beautiful building and sing

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,920
and sing about flying, but they've walked in, they sing and sing about flying, and then

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,560
they walk out and go home.

98
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
That's vintage.

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
That's vintage Kierkegaard.

100
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,560
And it's geese, and of course there's all kinds of stuff about geese.

101
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:55,920
You get this amazing, like the irony is coming through and the humor is coming through, and

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,720
you can see how that's part of his critique of Christendom, right?

103
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:07,240
The birds singing about flight who never ever take flight, yes.

104
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,480
And you laughed, which is the proper response.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,920
So I think it's very important that we explore this.

106
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,440
First of all, there's a deep connection, like there's a continuum even I would propose

107
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,480
between, and Nago says the same, in his seminal essay, The Absurd, between humor and The Absurd.

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,000
And of course, Monty Python was excellent at really walking the place where they overlap.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,960
So I just watched the scene again about the Trial of the Witch.

110
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh, it's great.

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Which is...

112
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm duck.

113
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I just always...

114
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Who are you?

115
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm so wise in the ways of science and all that wonderful stuff.

116
00:07:48,440 --> 00:08:01,640
And so it's important because there's a sense in which a refusal to incorporate humor into

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:08,960
the following of the logos as a spiritual orientation actually innervates us with an

118
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,240
ability to have a human transcendence with respect to The Absurd.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,320
That's a proposal I'm offering.

120
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,240
So first of all, and I talked about this in Awakening from the Meeting Crisis, but Nago's

121
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,280
beautiful article, at least the first half of it, where he's talking about absurdity,

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,960
and he says, we give all of these arguments that are supposed to both justify and generate

123
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,480
our sense of absurdity.

124
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
But he takes each one of the arguments and he demolishes them.

125
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
They don't actually...

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,880
Well, what you're doing won't matter a million years from now, but that's symmetrical.

127
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,960
What people are thinking a million years from now shouldn't matter to you.

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Exactly.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Exactly.

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
I'm so small.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,280
Well, if I made you really, really big, would you somehow find the life more meaningful?

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
No.

133
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Right?

134
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,520
And he says, okay, so the arguments are after the fact.

135
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
And then he goes into...

136
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,720
And he gives an example that's humorous.

137
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,680
I think you remember it, right?

138
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
So there's this...

139
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
And this is...

140
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
Is it the call?

141
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
The phone call?

142
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,680
From the dark before times, before we had smartphones.

144
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Yeah.

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Right?

146
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,560
And we actually had physical phones and we had these archaic devices called voice recorders

147
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,120
so people could leave you a message.

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
A what?

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,240
And so it goes like this, there's this fellow, he's summoned up his courage to call this

151
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,360
woman he loves, let's say Susan, and it's almost like a Bob Newhart routine.

152
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,240
And he, like, Susan, hello, don't say anything.

153
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,240
Right?

154
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,480
I just, I have to tell you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,800
And then he hears, Susan is not here right now, and you laugh, right?

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,320
And then Nalisa says, why is that funny?

157
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
And it's because we've got two...

158
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:56,040
And this is the thing you were saying that was like stepping into the traffic and I do

159
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,880
start going into the...

160
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,200
Getting running over by the carriage.

161
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Right, right.

162
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,840
Because what you have is from that guy's perspective, right, everything he's doing is so rich with

163
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,880
meaning and he's in the first person perspective and he's trying to set up an I-Thout relationship.

164
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,280
And then the machine suddenly introduces the impersonal third person perspective that takes

165
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,080
all of that away.

166
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,840
And we're reminded that we have these two perspectives and they can be juxtaposed in

167
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,680
a way in which one undermines the other.

168
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,040
Now what's interesting is, of course, he uses that example and it's humorous.

169
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,680
When I use that example in class, I first just tell it like that and everybody laughs.

170
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,800
But then sometimes what I'll do is I'll go back and I'll get in, yeah, but really think,

171
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,920
I don't know what to say, but then I'll say it's John, right?

172
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,600
John went home and really reflected on that.

173
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,680
But all of these moments that are so first person perspective meaningful to him are in

174
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,400
this third person perspective and then you can see their faces change into, oh my gosh,

175
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,920
I've woken up at 3 a.m. and wondered, does this all mean anything?

176
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,920
And then they feel the family resemblance proximity between humor and absurdity because

177
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,920
both of them, and this is really important, both of them involve perspectival clash.

178
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,720
But here's a proposal I have for you and this is why we should talk about the two in relation.

179
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:38,200
I think humor involves perspectival clash that we resolve with a kind of insight.

180
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:46,760
I think absurdity involves a perspectival clash that drops us into participatory paradox

181
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,360
where our existence is fundamentally called into question.

182
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,080
And then I think the response there is something that, again, can overlap with humor, but it's

183
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
different.

184
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,680
I think the response there, the proper response is wonder, the proper response is to call

185
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,120
both your world and yourself into deep question, right?

186
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,680
And so I put it to you that I think that humor bears the same relationship to the absurd that

187
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:22,120
irony does to the paradox in the sense not of being one-to-one maps, but one is on the

188
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,320
same continuum and affords us and prepares us.

189
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:34,560
So if we do not develop the capacity of humor, of bringing perspectives, notice how I'm emphasizing

190
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
perspectival and participatory knowing, if we can't bring them into this and then look

191
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:48,560
for an insight in humor, then we are not properly educated, adduced to when we confront the

192
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,760
absurdity, not having a propositional, not even having a fully perspectival insight, but

193
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,800
something that requires a fundamental restructuring of our being, a metanoia, right?

194
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,720
So the humor prepares us within perspectival transformation for a perspectival participatory

195
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
transformation.

196
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Exactly.

197
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
That's my proposal.

198
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Yes.

199
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Okay.

200
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,080
I think that the proposal, at least, I think I'm in total agreement, at least with the

201
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
gist of it.

202
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,840
I think that we can talk about exactly what the relationship is between irony and humor.

203
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,200
I think that the idea that irony, I think what you said as humor is to the absurd, what irony

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
is to paradox.

205
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Right.

206
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,800
But I wasn't trying to draw an equivalence between irony and humor.

207
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Right.

208
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,400
The proportion, the developmental relationship was all I'm drawing into the analogy.

209
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah.

210
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah.

211
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,840
And so I think that the crux of the move you're making is exactly right and very kick-a-guardian.

212
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,360
That humor is a kind of intercategorical response that changes and reorders our fundamental

213
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,440
stance in relation to the absurdity of existence.

214
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Right.

215
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Right.

216
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
And I think that's what you said in so many words.

217
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Yes.

218
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes.

219
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Yes.

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Humor does that.

221
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
No.

222
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,000
But the humor that takes us forward is wonder.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,240
The humor that begins in irony, not all humor begins in irony, but some humor begins in irony.

224
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,180
The irony that begins with the vis-à-vis of those two perspectives, when they see one

225
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,240
another and are aghast at one another.

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,240
That irony, that particular kind that turns into humor is the kind that we're talking

227
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,460
about, which is the preparation for, which is the receptivity to paradox and the assumption

228
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,920
of the paradox happens through humor.

229
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,680
We're going to have to do a little bit of qualification about what humor, what we actually

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
mean by this.

231
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes.

232
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Yeah.

233
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Yeah.

234
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Yeah.

235
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Yeah.

236
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah.

237
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,680
Because you're right.

238
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
There are different kinds of humor.

239
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
Yes.

240
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,960
And also, people kind of think of humor as just like, you know, just like when we talk about

241
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:04,320
irony, we're not talking about a kind of social affectation.

242
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
We're not talking about a temperamental accessory.

243
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,880
We're not talking about a reaction spontaneously to a situation, although cultivated irony can

244
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,640
produce ironic reactions just as cultivated humor can produce moments of humor.

245
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,320
But we're talking about a fundamental attitude.

246
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,320
We're talking about a cultivated way of being, a life view, a way of understanding and making

247
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,540
sense of the world, a way of ordering, a kind of meta-meaningful way of putting things

248
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,840
into right arrangement.

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,280
And we're not talking about that on a propositional level.

250
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,280
We're talking about a posture in response to the absurdity of life.

251
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,600
So when we're talking about humor, we don't just mean, I laugh at something that's funny.

252
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,080
We're talking about an attitude that we carry into a situation, not simply something that

253
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,080
we're foist with as a spontaneous moment of reacting.

254
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,240
So is this like, because Highland talks about this infinitude and transcendence, the ancient

255
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:14,760
sense of comedy and tragedy, where comedy is a particular way, and they're not opposites,

256
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,040
maybe opponent processing, the aspectualizations of the absurd, where what comedy does is it

257
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,680
makes you laugh at the absurd so we don't take ourselves too seriously, whereas tragedy

258
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,800
makes you wonder at the absurd so we realize that we should take ourselves seriously.

259
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Right.

260
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Right.

261
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
And you've got the playoff between those two.

262
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Right.

263
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Right.

264
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Exactly.

265
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:44,640
So the comic actually kind of helps to almost to elasticize your relationship by being

266
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
able to multi-aspectualize.

267
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Yes.

268
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Yes.

269
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Yeah.

270
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah.

271
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Exactly.

272
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Right.

273
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Exactly.

274
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Exactly.

275
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Exactly.

276
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Exactly.

277
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Exactly.

278
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Exactly.

279
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Exactly.

280
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Exactly.

281
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
All right.

282
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Exactly.

283
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Exactly.

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Exactly.

285
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
In a sense.

286
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Right.

287
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
That's totally what it is.

288
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
That, those, those aspects shifts are at the core of insight.

289
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Right.

290
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Right.

291
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
And of course, humor when it's cultivated well is productive of insight.

292
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Right.

293
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
Right.

294
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
Right.

295
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Right.

296
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
You hear good humor.

297
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
What?

298
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Sorry.

299
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
The humor we're talking about, I mean, good in that sense.

300
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,640
to what the really good joke is actually not found

301
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,320
in the propositional content of the joke,

302
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,960
though that too can be funny.

303
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,960
The joke, the master ironist who is also a humorist

304
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,520
finds the source of his humor, or her humor,

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,080
as the case may be, in the way they stand

306
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,360
in relation to the joke that they have made.

307
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,240
It is a characterological move that they're making.

308
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,560
Their position relative to what is uttered

309
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,560
is actually where the humor is.

310
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,720
It's not simply within the semantic content of the joke.

311
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,560
That's why I did the story of the geese,

312
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,160
because they're doing something absurd,

313
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,480
and you get the juxtaposition,

314
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,520
and it's like the two perspectives

315
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,240
in the story of the person with the voice recorder,

316
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,040
and it's funny there, but you realize,

317
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,240
but the joke's actually on us because we often

318
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,320
are the geese that sing about flying and never fly.

319
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,640
Exactly, exactly.

320
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,000
So in Kierkegaard, or Odin, I think makes a,

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
and I can't do it justice right now,

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
but I highly, highly recommend it,

323
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,960
this book, The Humor of Kierkegaard.

324
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,240
He makes an argument that goes something like this,

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,280
that basically, just as irony,

326
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
waking up inside the dream,

327
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,120
waking up within the mirage of ideality

328
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,560
that has us extend ourself infinitely,

329
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,240
but somehow within time, right?

330
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,040
That just as irony wakes us up

331
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,880
within the aesthetic stage of life

332
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,560
and prepares us for transition to the ethical,

333
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,240
for commitment, for commitment to an either-or,

334
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,680
instead of the impasse of either-or,

335
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,640
because irony prepares us to live within the bounds

336
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,520
of commitment, still somehow under the aspect of the eternal.

337
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Humor, for Odin, he makes the argument

338
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,840
that in Kierkegaard, humor does something similar

339
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,920
in the transition from the ethical to the religious.

340
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,120
Oh, oh, oh.

341
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,280
That's the move he makes.

342
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,560
That's very, that's very good.

343
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,400
So that irony is to the aesthetic

344
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
what humor is to the ethical.

345
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,760
Right, right.

346
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,520
A way of waking up inside of it,

347
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,120
and realizing that it is not ultimate.

348
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,000
Right, right, and of course,

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,440
a lot of Socratic humor is that way too.

350
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,280
And I even-

351
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,560
You're corrupting the youth.

352
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,160
Actually, Socrates says,

353
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,120
I think that you should be paying before it.

354
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,200
Yes, exactly, exactly.

355
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Right, and you're paying the apology, right?

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,840
I can't remember exactly,

357
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,680
but it's something like that.

358
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,440
What do you think your just punishment should be?

359
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
You should give me state sponsorship

360
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,800
for the rest of my life.

361
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,640
That's right, yeah.

362
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
Right, exactly.

363
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,920
So-

364
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
No, I like this proposal.

365
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,080
I think this is really,

366
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,800
I just wanna make sure I'm understanding it.

367
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,040
So irony sort of gives you

368
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,960
the requisite cognitive flexibility

369
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,400
to get an insight out of the aesthetic into the ethical.

370
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,800
And then humor,

371
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,880
at least the kind of humor we're talking about here,

372
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,120
gives you an insight out of the ethical

373
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,440
into the religious.

374
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,280
That's right.

375
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,680
But could tragedy also do that?

376
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,840
Because what I just said,

377
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
that pairing between comedy, right,

378
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,600
in which-

379
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,160
I don't think you have one without the other.

380
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
No, no, of course.

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,080
And Jonathan Miller made it famous

382
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,680
that when you're putting on,

383
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,240
as she experienced tragedy,

384
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,080
you emphasize-

385
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,920
You lean into the humor.

386
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,760
You lean into the humor.

387
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,600
And we do the same.

388
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,440
And we do the same.

389
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,280
That's right.

390
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Because they're yin-yang with each other.

391
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,960
That's right.

392
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,640
And good drama, good dramatists know that.

393
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,040
In general.

394
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,880
Because what I'm proposing is,

395
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,640
we've got the humor telling us,

396
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,400
don't, they're saying to the ethical person,

397
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
don't take your ethical framework so-

398
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,680
Seriously.

399
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,520
That's right.

400
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
But the tragic figure is saying,

401
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,760
you know what?

402
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,040
You need to take your life

403
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,960
and your aspiration to virtue.

404
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,200
Seriously.

405
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,040
That's right.

406
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,000
And there is no algorithm for resolving that.

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,840
Right?

408
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,680
It's a point of process.

409
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,520
That's right.

410
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,320
We were talking about this earlier.

411
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
I just wanna bring it out

412
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,880
because I think it's solely also appropriate

413
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,480
to both Kierkegaard and Socrates

414
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,560
because I see them both as taking on this role.

415
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,240
So you've got somebody that's doing humor, right?

416
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,720
And what you just said about challenging the frameworks,

417
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,280
that's the gesture before the king.

418
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Yeah, that's right.

419
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,120
Right?

420
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,480
You have all this authority and all the laws,

421
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
but here I am reminding you,

422
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,560
don't take yourself too seriously.

423
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,680
Because you are not what is ultimate.

424
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Right, but you also have the prophet.

425
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,000
Now, I don't mean prophet in the person

426
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,320
who tells the future, the fortune teller.

427
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
I mean the biblical prophet,

428
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,320
the person that's not foretelling,

429
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,600
they're telling forth.

430
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,120
They're trying to get people to see more deeply

431
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,960
into what's happening.

432
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,080
And you have Nathan coming before

433
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,320
the greatest king of the Old Testament, David.

434
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
And he's a prophet and he tells them this story.

435
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,680
He tells them the story about this guy, right?

436
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
Who has one sheep and there's this other guy

437
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,240
who has all these sheep

438
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
and David's outraged.

439
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,600
And then he says, that's what you did with Bathsheba.

440
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,800
And David goes, oh, right, right?

441
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,800
And that's, he makes David see the tragedy

442
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
of what he has done, right?

443
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,120
And that's also something that takes you out of

444
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,600
the ethical into, so they're both.

445
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
There's the prophet and the gesture.

446
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,200
And then here's my proposal, both Socrates

447
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,480
and Kierkegaard are both.

448
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,240
Yes, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.

449
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Absolutely, I couldn't agree more.

450
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,440
So, okay, so, okay.

451
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,320
So let's take that proposal.

452
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
Let's presuppose it for a moment.

453
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
And then let's talk about maybe both aspects.

454
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,200
Totally.

455
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
Discreetly.

456
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,440
And then we'll bring them back together.

457
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,400
Okay, okay.

458
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,640
Because each one, right, the tragedy reminds us

459
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,200
of transcendence while we're finite.

460
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,360
And the humorous reminds us of the transcendence

461
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,320
coming into the finite.

462
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,280
That's right.

463
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,400
That's why humor, the good humorous,

464
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
one of the things that the good humorous does

465
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,760
is show performative contradiction.

466
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Yes.

467
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,720
The humorous actually, it's one of the ways

468
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,400
that the humorous alerts, alerts.

469
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,440
I just want to make clear what performative contradiction

470
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,320
is for, right?

471
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,020
So, and it's important because performative contradiction

472
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,180
is something that moves us outside of the propositional.

473
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,020
Yes.

474
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,180
So a classic example of a performative contradiction

475
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,460
is I am sleeping.

476
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,300
Yes.

477
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,140
Because that statement in so far

478
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,860
is how it's referring objectively.

479
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,140
Of course I sleep.

480
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,620
But when I utter that statement,

481
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,460
I can't be asleep in order to utter it.

482
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,180
So there's a contradiction between the proposition

483
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,780
and the perspectival and participant point.

484
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,620
That's right.

485
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,460
That's right.

486
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,300
Good, good, good.

487
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,500
And you see how that the performative contradiction,

488
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,100
one of the things that it does is it de-idolizes

489
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,900
the ethical of the religiosity

490
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,700
with which it is often unduly invested.

491
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
What I mean by that is this.

492
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:20,180
It shows that we can be beholden

493
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,100
to the custom of an ethic

494
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,780
while at the same time depicting

495
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,120
and coming into awareness of the fact

496
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,660
that we do not in fact live in accordance with it.

497
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,140
We do not live in a way that presupposes it

498
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,180
as the highest good and index of what is true.

499
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,220
So this is Jesus.

500
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,300
The Sabbath was made for human beings,

501
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,740
not human beings for the Sabbath.

502
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,580
Right.

503
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Right, right, right, right.

504
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,660
I'll give you my favorite example.

505
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,460
So I had a great conversation a little while back

506
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,660
with Sevilla King about this.

507
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,420
My favorite current humorist

508
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,940
who is also an ironist is Dave Chappelle.

509
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,540
And I don't think there's anybody around

510
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,900
that does it better than him right now.

511
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,780
And he has this joke that I think

512
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,020
basically sums it all up.

513
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,860
He says at one point, one of his specials,

514
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,420
he goes, he's talking to an audience

515
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,780
that is, I would say politically speaking,

516
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,980
kind of generally left leaning.

517
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,000
As is he by all accounts, by his own admission.

518
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,580
But he's very hard to pin down when he does a standup

519
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,980
because he assumes different identities and perspectives.

520
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,620
And he often leads you down a road

521
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,380
thinking you're being set up for one thing,

522
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,780
but the joke comes in from the left side.

523
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
That's very quick of the guardian.

524
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,980
Very.

525
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,380
So he says at one point,

526
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,340
he's talking about a variety of political topics

527
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,700
and he's talking about gun control.

528
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,100
And he just sort of shakes his head and he goes,

529
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,500
I hate guns, I can't stand them.

530
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,660
And of course the audience, someone cheers,

531
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,860
yeah, no guns.

532
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,260
And he goes, yeah, but I have several.

533
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,180
And that to me is one of the most well-crafted jokes

534
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,660
imaginable because what it does is,

535
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,980
he means it when he says he doesn't like guns.

536
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,820
He can't stand them.

537
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,020
And he means it when he says he has several.

538
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,460
Right, right, right.

539
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,180
And what he's doing is he's,

540
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,780
so he's making, now there's an obvious joke

541
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,820
about two perspectives, right?

542
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,940
Clashing, yes.

543
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,900
A very obvious performative contradiction.

544
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,820
So that's the first order of the joke is this.

545
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,100
There's a performative contradiction,

546
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,180
he's woken up to it, right?

547
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,260
He goes, I am at quits with myself

548
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,820
because I espouse an ideological position

549
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,980
that is in accordance with a prevailing ethical framework.

550
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,460
And it's a framework that, at least in our ethos,

551
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,660
many people are aligned with, right?

552
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,180
And on the one hand, he realizes that there is something

553
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,900
about him, about the way that he lives,

554
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
the way that he behaves, that there's that variance

555
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,420
with that ethic, that he can't comport himself.

556
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,420
He can kind of, he can stand to it, he can espouse it,

557
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,380
but there's something in him that issues it,

558
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,900
that eludes it, that bucks it, right?

559
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,300
So that's one level of the joke,

560
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,620
but the higher order of the joke,

561
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,220
which is really the source of the joke,

562
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,220
is that he's standing beside himself,

563
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,660
looking at the performative contradiction going, Jesus.

564
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,940
Yeah, yeah.

565
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,180
And he's pointing implicitly at his audience and going,

566
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,020
see, see, yes, yeah.

567
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,860
See that?

568
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,900
See that, right?

569
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,020
Don't, do you see that?

570
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,420
Do you see how I am quite beside myself?

571
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,820
How I am quite not myself?

572
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,780
How I am quite at variance with myself.

573
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,900
Right, and these are the Christian guardian themes

574
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,740
you've been at, versus.

575
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,980
He is, he is the source of the joke.

576
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,540
He is its object, right?

577
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,660
Right, right, right.

578
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,900
He's showing the performative contradiction,

579
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,220
but he's turning in the direction

580
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,020
of the performative contradiction and wondering at it.

581
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,860
Okay, so let me, I-

582
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,260
And finding himself in a moment of absurdity

583
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,900
allowed before an audience.

584
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,220
So I just want to slow this down,

585
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
because this is really brilliant.

586
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,420
So he does this first move, which is,

587
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,940
as you properly described it,

588
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,900
how humor gets you to undermine, right,

589
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,300
the sort of self-righteous absolutism

590
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,620
of a particular ethical framework.

591
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,380
But then, you can't then defer to him as the authority

592
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,260
that is now going to be made sacred,

593
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,460
because he's also in the performative contradiction

594
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,820
undermining himself.

595
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,500
Oh, that's very good, that's very good, that's very good.

596
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,020
Right, he does something very similar.

597
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,460
He has a joke, he picks these remarkably contentious topics.

598
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,620
He has a joke about, he talks about abortion, right,

599
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,300
and then immediately gets an audience

600
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,980
on the edge of its seat, right?

601
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,260
Yeah, they're really a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,620
Even someone who's watching this right now is like,

603
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,820
oh God, what's he about to say?

604
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,420
And he says, and he goes, he stops it again,

605
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,460
he's talking to a relatively left-leaning audience.

606
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,740
And he looks at the audience and he goes,

607
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,900
I gotta tell you, I'm not for abortion.

608
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,340
There's maybe two people clapping.

609
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,420
And he goes, I'm not for it, and I'm not against it either.

610
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,420
It all depends on who I get pregnant, right?

611
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,580
The same thing is happening there.

612
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,940
The exact same dynamic is happening, right?

613
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,180
And then he takes it even further,

614
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,180
and he says, and he takes up this,

615
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,980
he sort of takes up a kind of a caricature

616
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,140
of a moralizing persona, and he says,

617
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,100
I honestly believe, and I think he means it,

618
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,140
I honestly believe that I believe

619
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,100
in a woman's right to choose,

620
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,300
and I believe that right is unequivocal and unquestionable,

621
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,540
and she should not have to consult anybody

622
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,460
except for a physician as to how she applies that right.

623
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,940
Gentlemen, that is fair, it's their choice.

624
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,860
And then he says, and ladies, to be fair to us,

625
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,260
I also think that if you choose to have the baby,

626
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,540
the man should not have to penny.

627
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,740
If you can kill this kid, I can at least abandon him.

628
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,060
Now, imagine the blood rushing to the face

629
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,380
adhering to something like that,

630
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,420
but the fact of the matter is-

631
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,260
So what does the audience do?

632
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,060
Do they laugh, or what do they do in that situation?

633
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,940
Well, are they laughing nervously?

634
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,860
Yes, I think so, I can't remember exactly,

635
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,820
but they're definitely laughing.

636
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,060
There's a little bit of, there's an intake of breath,

637
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,220
there's a nervous laughter, there's a mixed reaction,

638
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,300
but it's very uproarious.

639
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,620
So I wanna get this, first of all, he calls this up,

640
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,140
and everybody sees their commitment,

641
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,780
and then he calls out a contradiction, right?

642
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,660
And then he's also placed himself, right,

643
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,420
that this isn't an abstract thing, it involves me,

644
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,980
and I'll be egocentric when it involves me.

645
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Exactly.

646
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,540
And he's got all this going, and you're going, wow.

647
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,700
So first of all, he is making us aware

648
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,580
of all of these different perspectival clashes,

649
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,860
and how there's a complexity there

650
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,700
that we are, in many instances, trying to avoid.

651
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,500
That's right, and what he's showing is that

652
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,700
this doesn't make sense, like when we put these pieces

653
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,380
together, they don't fit.

654
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,700
Don't, do you see everybody?

655
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm putting all the pieces together,

656
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,220
I'm fitting the perspectives, I'm putting them

657
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,660
face to face, and they don't agree,

658
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,460
and they don't make for a coherent life view.

659
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,620
That means that something about the way

660
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,060
that we've, I'm editorializing him a little bit,

661
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,740
and that in some ways I shouldn't even be doing this much.

662
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,260
But for the sake of explanation, I think,

663
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,700
what he's doing is something like this,

664
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,060
is like he's putting all of these perspectives together,

665
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,980
and he's gathering them into this,

666
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,780
he's trying to squish them into the ethical frame

667
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,060
that we have decided to use as a way of arbitrating

668
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,780
the norm, and it doesn't all fit together,

669
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,700
and he's going, look everyone,

670
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,820
we are full of performative contradictions

671
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,820
when we try to absolutize this ethical framework.

672
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,420
And it doesn't fit, so something is missing.

673
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,860
And that removes our capacity for empathy

674
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,380
and understanding of people who have ethical position

675
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,620
other than ours.

676
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,620
Like if we fail to grasp the humility of our humanity

677
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,500
that we are caught up in performative contradictions,

678
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,260
it is very easy for us to defy our side

679
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,100
and demonize the other side.

680
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,380
Right, right, right.

681
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,700
Which of course undermines what ethics

682
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,060
is supposed to be doing.

683
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,220
Right, of course it's.

684
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,900
That's a huge performative contradiction

685
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
of the entire frame.

686
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Huge, huge.

687
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,700
Okay, so that's just to kind of tie that back in.

688
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,460
Essentially what the ironic humorist

689
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,060
who can pit perspectival frames against one another

690
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,780
and fit them under the same overall marquee of normativity

691
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,140
that is espoused by a particular culture

692
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,580
does so to reveal how when you actually frame it properly,

693
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,780
when you try and step back and see it

694
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,660
in any kind of final way.

695
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,140
And if you try and see through that.

696
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,460
Ironically.

697
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,500
That's beautiful.

698
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
When you try and look at your ethical frame,

699
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,460
unironically it results in an aporia.

700
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,420
It becomes absurd because it does not fit together.

701
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,660
He's opening up exposure to the absurdity

702
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,140
within the ethical and in so doing gestures outside of it.

703
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,300
Right, and so what you're saying is

704
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,060
both Kierkegaard and Socrates are doing this.

705
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,100
And so I'm thinking of when Socrates is talking

706
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,580
to Euthyphro who knows what all what,

707
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,300
he knows what piety is.

708
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,860
And he's about to prosecute his father for being impious.

709
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,540
Right, and then Socrates says the famous,

710
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,660
well, what, right, right.

711
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,340
First of all, he gets from Euthyphro.

712
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,180
Well, what is it?

713
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,020
Well, it's to do what the gods tell us.

714
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,940
Well, do the gods tell us to do something

715
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,420
because it's good?

716
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,700
Or is it good because the gods do it?

717
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,900
And Euthyphro wants it both ways

718
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,300
because either way undermines his position,

719
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
puts him into performative contradiction,

720
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,940
and he realizes, and so what does he do?

721
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,180
He literally runs away from Socrates.

722
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,780
Right, yeah, yeah, right.

723
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
That's right, and you know what?

724
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,420
That's what people often do in face of the humorous.

725
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,780
They turn and they run.

726
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,140
But here's the thing.

727
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,300
Put all that, there's all that humor,

728
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,900
but where's Socrates going?

729
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,300
He's going to the courtroom to face his charges

730
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,500
that are gonna lead to his death.

731
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,660
Yes, yes, yes.

732
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,420
There's the humorous and the tragedy.

733
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,260
And the tragedy.

734
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,100
Bound up together.

735
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,940
Unfolded together.

736
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,780
Yeah.

737
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,380
And you really can't, because they are simply

738
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,500
as specializations of the same condition of existence

739
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,060
that has us fraught with the contradiction of our humanness,

740
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,780
that you can't have one without the other, right?

741
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,820
So this makes me think again,

742
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,660
of dialectic into Deologos

743
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
and when people are doing the practice.

744
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:32,500
Like, there's two ways in which it can go wrong.

745
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,380
We can get so serious

746
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,460
that we start to choke the flow of insight

747
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,420
that is the life breath of a Logos.

748
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,980
But we can also fail by not taking it seriously enough

749
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,500
so we do not put ourselves at stake in the practice.

750
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,500
So we need both the prophetic and the gesture, right?

751
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,420
The prophet and the comedian, right?

752
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,700
Both have to be,

753
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,940
we have to be constantly toggling between them

754
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,980
as we participate in the practice

755
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,100
because we can fail.

756
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,220
This is Aristotle's classic idea

757
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,700
about how you do the virtual engineering of a virtue.

758
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,900
You have constraints that limit and constraints that afford

759
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,980
because we're always moving between deficit and access.

760
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,820
We can take ourselves too seriously

761
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,380
and we can fail to take ourselves seriously enough.

762
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,540
And when we put the two together

763
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,380
in the practice of dialectic, we can get again,

764
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,860
this is yet another way of how we can lean into

765
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,660
and start to take up the orientation

766
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,260
of finite transcendence

767
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,060
that really is the place that gives birth to the Logos.

768
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,460
That's right, well said, well said.

769
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,020
And when we undertake that practice

770
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,460
to remain sufficiently mobile

771
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,980
to be able to migrate our perspective properly.

772
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,340
And also to develop the kind of,

773
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,540
to develop the kind of,

774
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,860
to socialize the process properly, right?

775
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,300
That's another function that the humor has, right?

776
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,620
Of course, of course.

777
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,380
Is that it helps establish the relation, right?

778
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Right, because you can't tell a joke on your own.

779
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,940
A joke is inherently,

780
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,460
humor is inherently multi-perspectival,

781
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,700
multi-espectual and dialogical.

782
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,260
Same thing with tragedy, right?

783
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,620
So now, here, again, like I did last time,

784
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,020
I wanna do this sort of semi-provocative thing with you

785
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,700
because I can deeply trust you, right?

786
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,700
Cryptoguard, to me, is great evidence

787
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,380
of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy

788
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,580
like into a disclosure of how one can see the world,

789
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
the way Christ, the way Jesus did.

790
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,820
I'll use my language if that's okay.

791
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,740
There, right.

792
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,060
And we see humor clearly in Socrates.

793
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,060
We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.

794
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,020
We see it clearly, right?

795
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,100
In many great sages,

796
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,340
like Shwangza from the Taoist tradition

797
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,780
is this humor after humor after.

798
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,820
I don't see it in the Bible, in the New Testament.

799
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,580
We were talking about this the other day.

800
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,500
We were, and that's interesting.

801
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Because we have an overwhelming presentation of the tragic

802
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,540
in the sense we've been talking about here, right?

803
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,900
It's, right?

804
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:27,300
And we also get presentation of human beings being foolish,

805
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,020
but it's not, but it's always filled with pathos.

806
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,860
That's true.

807
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,620
That might be true on its own terms,

808
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,140
although it puts me in mind, again,

809
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,220
of some of Kirkegaard's thoughts on the topic

810
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,980
because one of the things that he takes pains to point out,

811
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,900
and that Odin does a good job of pointing out,

812
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,460
is that he understands the incarnation

813
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,660
as being something remarkably comic, right?

814
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,500
Really?

815
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,340
Yes.

816
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,180
Yes.

817
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,340
Oh, you're gonna have to unpack that for me,

818
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:59,260
because like the sort of green shadow

819
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,340
of my Christian sensibility, right?

820
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,700
It's like getting irked, and it's like,

821
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,420
I'm even surprised in this moment right now

822
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,580
that I'm getting irked by that,

823
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,740
because like, what's going on in me?

824
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,500
But anyways.

825
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,540
Well, I know, and it's a kind of calculated,

826
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,180
Socratic heresy, for him, it's no such heresy, right?

827
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:19,860
Because for him, humor is, humor is in some sense,

828
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,460
the birth canal towards the serious and the religious,

829
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,380
to use your language from yesterday, right?

830
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,540
The canal.

831
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,940
I mean, think for a moment of,

832
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,100
in the same way that,

833
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,940
you know what makes me think there's that old like,

834
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,780
fable about Phaelies that, you know,

835
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,020
he's gazing up, right?

836
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,260
One of the earliest philosophers,

837
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,540
he's looking up at the sky.

838
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,380
The stars and he falls into the well.

839
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,460
And he's beholden into the well.

840
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,300
Yeah, and he falls into the well.

841
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,860
It's something very much like that, right?

842
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,580
Or Heraclitus.

843
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,540
Did you know how he dies?

844
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,460
Oh, buried in a horse manure.

845
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,300
Horse manure.

846
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
Right.

847
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,700
Right, yeah.

848
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,060
So you have this,

849
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,260
you have the impregnation of the finite by the infinite.

850
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,140
Okay, so you have something like that.

851
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,980
And for Kierkegaard,

852
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,780
the fact of the Son of God being born into a stable

853
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,540
in the lowliest of conditions

854
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,900
and the most impoverished of settings,

855
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,860
isn't simply paradoxical.

856
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,140
I mean, it is.

857
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,420
But the attitude that accompanies the paradox,

858
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,620
the affective manner of that paradox for him

859
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,540
is the comic, right?

860
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,380
So how do you get,

861
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,700
so, okay, this is,

862
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,100
I wanna really slow down on this

863
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,300
because you're really intriguing me with this.

864
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,900
So I get the paradoxical and how even the tragic

865
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,180
are so such perfect vehicles for the numinous.

866
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,020
Yes.

867
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,540
And of course, many people,

868
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,100
I do this, you know,

869
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,300
I don't consider myself a Christian,

870
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
but at Christmas time,

871
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,300
I insist on there being a nativity seen put up

872
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,220
because there's something numinous going on, right?

873
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,580
And so, like I say,

874
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:55,540
and, you know, auto, the fascinating and the tremendous.

875
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,020
And so the tragedy and the tremendous

876
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,620
go well together, the fascinating, right?

877
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,140
How does, how would the,

878
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140
do you see what I'm trying to get at?

879
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,460
How would you,

880
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,860
how did the comic and the numinous come together?

881
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,620
Well, one of the things that the comic does, I think,

882
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:16,220
think of this physiologically for a second, right?

883
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,380
Like we're talking about humor

884
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,940
as though it's this sort of abstract thing,

885
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:20,340
but think of it like viscerally.

886
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,420
Think of what happens affectively, right?

887
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,180
Think of what happens when something strikes you as comic

888
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,140
and you will laugh

889
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,580
and you'll get that sensation in your body.

890
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,660
It is a way of,

891
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,260
I think what it does is it disrupts your categorical thinking

892
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,740
by re-disposing the attitude you take

893
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
in the face of something that on its face,

894
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,300
one taken literally doesn't add up.

895
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,060
But one thing that humor does is I think

896
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,500
it softens our attention, right?

897
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,780
It's a certain form of sensitization.

898
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,020
And I think in the case of this biblical example,

899
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,060
I think what it does is it helps to inoculate

900
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:00,100
the literalism that would accompany

901
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,860
the self-seriousness taken towards such a thing.

902
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,220
Oh, okay, okay, I wanna savor this.

903
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,300
I wanna savor this, this is good.

904
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,820
So the idea is if we only look at it one way,

905
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,420
there's a tremendous temptation to literalism

906
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,060
and a kind of fundamentalism,

907
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,060
which of course is anathema to all of this stuff

908
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,900
we've been talking about.

909
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,740
Anathema to everything.

910
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,580
Yeah, yeah, okay.

911
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,940
And so what you're doing is to remember the comic

912
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,020
means you don't take the literal presentation.

913
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,020
So seriously, so it's like the way the parables

914
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,820
undermined the narrative framework.

915
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,100
Right, right, so that they don't calcify the perspective.

916
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,940
Okay, so excellent, excellent.

917
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,620
While you were saying that something else came to mind

918
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,460
and I wanna see if they go together,

919
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,660
I was realizing, oh, but John,

920
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,780
you have been so inculturated to regard laughter

921
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
as always ridicule.

922
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,860
But the moments in which I have really laughed

923
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,500
have not been moments of ridicule.

924
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,140
They have been moments of joy.

925
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,940
So I grew up in Dundas and I was going to a school,

926
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,620
high school, and I had a really close friend.

927
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,020
And one day after school, we were in a room

928
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,700
and I said, what's that on your shelf there?

929
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,740
And he said, well, there's a game we can play.

930
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,860
And so I said, well, let's play it.

931
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,820
He said, okay, and then we get it out

932
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,220
and there were colored spheres.

933
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,660
And he was blue and my were green.

934
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,140
He says, okay, so count your spheres.

935
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,140
And he said, I have 13 and I said, I have 14, do I win?

936
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,220
And we laughed for 10 minutes after that.

937
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,820
Because it's all this setup and the game is just to count.

938
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,660
Beautiful.

939
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:41,700
Which of course it wasn't.

940
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,540
Beautiful.

941
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,380
Right?

942
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,620
And I'm not ridiculing him.

943
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,100
There's no ridicule at all.

944
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,460
The laughter is about, again,

945
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,140
a capacity to suddenly see through,

946
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,140
and again, to really properly move

947
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,300
between taking things seriously

948
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,620
and not taking them seriously.

949
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,460
Beautiful.

950
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,300
And there's a joy there.

951
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,140
Beautiful.

952
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,940
And I'll put these two together, right?

953
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,700
If we can think of,

954
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,820
if we can broaden our sense of the comic

955
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,820
to that which induces or conduces laughter.

956
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,180
And then if we can remember that a lot of our laughter

957
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,300
is not the laughter of ridicule,

958
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,400
but the laughter of celebration of our ability

959
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,700
to open up to reality.

960
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,380
And then if we can put that with laughter and comedy

961
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,420
as reminding us not to get entrapped

962
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,180
in an idolatry of the literal,

963
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,940
I'm getting a sense now of how the comic

964
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,460
can be part of the numinous.

965
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,620
So another moment that comes to mind about this,

966
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,600
so now this is really singing for me,

967
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,020
is that scene in C.S. Lewis

968
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,260
where the kids haven't met Aslan yet.

969
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,260
And they say, is he a tame lion?

970
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,380
And all the animals go, oh, of course,

971
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,140
and they're laughing, but he's good.

972
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,980
Yeah, yes.

973
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
So there's a punchline and there's humor,

974
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,060
and there's, right?

975
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,340
But nevertheless, the humor is in service of how numinous.

976
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,680
And it is ironic.

977
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,460
And it's ironic, I'm getting it now.

978
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:19,420
And it's so ironic about that is what the kids are saying,

979
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,620
what the kids are asking is, can we trust him?

980
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,460
Yes.

981
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,300
That's the question, right?

982
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,120
Yes.

983
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,340
And the irony is yes, but you have no idea

984
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,420
just how much.

985
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,300
Right, and you also don't,

986
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,060
it's the sensibility transcendence.

987
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,380
Not only do you need to have an insight into him,

988
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,060
you need to have a reflective insight in it.

989
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,900
You really don't understand trust yet.

990
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,740
Right.

991
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,300
You think of trust as, can I predict somebody?

992
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,100
Right, right, right, right, right.

993
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,220
Does what you're saying,

994
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,260
what you're saying participates in what is real,

995
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,100
unknowingly and yet beautifully and continuously,

996
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,620
and to such a degree that you can't begin to imagine

997
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,740
how it participates.

998
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,180
Yes, exactly, exactly.

999
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,100
It's, your story inspires me to tell one too,

1000
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,980
which is, I think, a similar friend of mine,

1001
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,740
Leslie Giley, who's one of the funniest people I know,

1002
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,220
and who's, and incidentally, who's Catholicism,

1003
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,500
I think is quite beautiful and quite inspiring,

1004
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,140
quite sophisticated.

1005
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,860
So I think of him at a moment like this.

1006
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,860
And this was many years ago,

1007
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,900
we were gathered together,

1008
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,100
a few of us friends we were watching the Olympics.

1009
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,100
And the Olympic hockey, which was a big deal in our house.

1010
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,380
Canada.

1011
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,220
Big deal.

1012
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,620
The official religion of Canada.

1013
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,260
The official religion of Canada, yes.

1014
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,700
The ethical religion,

1015
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,260
but sometimes it borders on the religious.

1016
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,180
Yeah, right, well said, well said.

1017
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,060
We can teleologically suspend the ethical for hockey.

1018
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,700
And it was the Olympics that was actually held in Canada,

1019
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,420
where Team Canada won the gold medal for hockey.

1020
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,700
And so it was quite an uproarious, okay?

1021
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,540
It's right.

1022
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,140
It was about as sacred as it could be

1023
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,700
without being in the proper category of the religious.

1024
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,340
And like we said, it's pretty close.

1025
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,420
Right.

1026
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:06,180
And so we go out for a walk afterwards

1027
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,060
and just really flesh, identifying very personally,

1028
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,380
very closely with this victory,

1029
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,620
which is interesting to me now.

1030
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,940
I don't think I would necessarily have the same reaction,

1031
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,980
but at the time it was very important.

1032
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,660
And we're walking down the street

1033
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,700
and there's a man who's,

1034
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,460
what is it, one or two?

1035
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,900
And he walking in our direction

1036
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,220
and they're clearly evangelizing.

1037
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,940
And I don't know what denomination they are,

1038
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,100
but they're evangelizing and they look at us

1039
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,900
and they sort of, they take on this sort of

1040
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,340
kind of solicitous manner like,

1041
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,780
oh, we're going to engage you in conversation.

1042
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,540
And we walk closer together

1043
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,860
and then my friend Leslie says,

1044
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,340
have you heard the good news?

1045
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,380
Now this is coming from a person

1046
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,900
who's properly religious, right?

1047
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,660
Yeah.

1048
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,380
And yet the irony of the way that something

1049
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,820
that is by all comparison, relatively profane,

1050
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,940
participates in what is sacred, right?

1051
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,780
If only by indirection.

1052
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,620
Right, right.

1053
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,140
It's something that is present in the humor

1054
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,180
and present in the joke.

1055
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,420
That's really good, that's really good.

1056
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,900
Anyway, so I think, so this connection,

1057
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,420
the other thing that the humorist does,

1058
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,620
and this is again, present in what is comical about Christ

1059
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,380
and comical about the incarnation.

1060
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,780
Again, not ridicule.

1061
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,700
No, comical.

1062
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,140
Right, the comic is not,

1063
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,980
so you've taken pains to say this

1064
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,380
and we should take more.

1065
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:35,860
The comic, comedy is often associated with cruelty

1066
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,140
and it needn't be, right?

1067
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,100
It really needn't be.

1068
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,740
So when I say, and when he says

1069
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,180
that the incarnation is comic,

1070
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,140
he is not debasing it.

1071
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,980
We're ridiculing it.

1072
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,820
He's not dispraising it.

1073
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,940
He's not ridiculing it.

1074
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,980
He's not trying to remove its sacredness.

1075
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,740
The profanity of the absurdity of the incarnation

1076
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,100
taking place in the lowliest setting imaginable

1077
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,460
in dexes to the sacred.

1078
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,740
And he dies, the death of a criminal and a terrorist.

1079
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,620
Right, you were talking earlier about,

1080
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,180
in one of our previous sessions,

1081
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:15,900
about the Socratic eros and how it transmutes

1082
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,700
from the lowly and sexual, the lowly and sexual.

1083
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:19,540
You know what I mean?

1084
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:23,740
To the anagogic.

1085
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,780
To the anagogic.

1086
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,940
And we have to think of this in the same way, right?

1087
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,340
Yes, there's a sense in which returning to the cave,

1088
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,100
of course, makes you susceptible to tragedy

1089
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,780
and that's in Plato's mind.

1090
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,540
But it also has, Plato puts a comedy in there

1091
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,140
because there's a joke there

1092
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,500
because when he comes back,

1093
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,300
he's stumbling around

1094
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,820
because his eyes aren't used to the dark

1095
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,420
and he's saying things that nobody believes.

1096
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,740
There's a then story like that about two frogs

1097
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,820
and one is at a pond and another one goes away.

1098
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,380
And it comes back.

1099
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,540
And the first frog says to the second,

1100
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,660
what happened?

1101
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,100
And he said, well, I saw the ocean.

1102
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,420
And the first frog says, is it half as big as my pond?

1103
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,980
And the first frog goes, no, it's bigger.

1104
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,620
It's a three quarters the size of my pond.

1105
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,180
And the second frog goes, no, no.

1106
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,940
And then he goes, well, is it as big as my pond?

1107
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,860
And then the second frog says, no, it's way bigger

1108
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,420
than you can, and then it says,

1109
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,980
and then the first frog's head explodes.

1110
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,020
But it's the same kind of thing.

1111
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,620
Like you realize that when the person comes back,

1112
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:45,860
in some sense, and there's something

1113
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,380
like you have to be really careful about here,

1114
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,060
the person that comes back after,

1115
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:55,820
the enlightened person that comes back, right?

1116
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:59,620
Can see him a buffoon, can see him a buffoon.

1117
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:04,620
Absolutely, and that's why the irony

1118
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,260
in order to be transmuted into a religious attitude

1119
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,680
needs to become humorous

1120
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,880
because the, oh, wait, I see it.

1121
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,400
That way the person takes up, oh, this is almost like Girard

1122
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,880
about like the sacrifice undermining the scapegoating.

1123
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,080
What the person, the sage, takes up,

1124
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,320
allows the projection of potential buffoonery and ridicule,

1125
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,560
and that but plays with the humor in there

1126
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,360
in order to turn it properly back on the person.

1127
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,520
That's right.

1128
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,880
So this reminds me of Woodruff's discussion

1129
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,880
in his book, Virtue, sorry, Reverence to Lost Virtue.

1130
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,200
He says, we now think of irreverence,

1131
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,520
and we take it as a compliment,

1132
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,360
but he said the job, satire is not ultimately

1133
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,840
about irreverence.

1134
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,000
It's about getting you to find irreverence for the idol

1135
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,320
so you get into proper reverence for the reality.

1136
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,240
Exactly, exactly.

1137
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,040
Irreverence toward the king means reverence to God.

1138
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,880
Exactly, exactly.

1139
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,720
Render unto, right?

1140
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,560
Yeah, yes, yes.

1141
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,600
That's exactly right.

1142
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,960
That's exactly right.

1143
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,960
And that's why great humorists,

1144
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
that's why the irreverence of a great humorist

1145
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,320
conceals a deep reverence for what is real.

1146
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,640
Only so much.

1147
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,720
It's like al-Athea.

1148
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,640
It's concealed, but it's also revealed.

1149
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,480
Yes.

1150
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,960
Those who have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, right?

1151
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,120
Yes, yes, because they stand outside of the arena,

1152
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,960
right at its outer perimeter, out on the horizon.

1153
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,800
That's right.

1154
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,640
The horizon of wonder.

1155
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,800
That's right, they stand on the horizon of wonder,

1156
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,600
and their irreverence refers attention to that horizon.

1157
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,880
If it is understood properly, and often it isn't,

1158
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,560
that's why we kill them.

1159
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,480
We kill them, literally or figuratively,

1160
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,280
we are in the business right now of killing good humorists

1161
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,200
as much as we possibly can, right?

1162
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,760
Right, now think of the idea of offense, right?

1163
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,640
Kierkegaard's idea of offense as the denial,

1164
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,640
the refusal of the beholding gaze of agape

1165
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,680
that reforms your relationship to yourself

1166
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,240
and the ground of your being to take offense at that,

1167
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,480
the idea of taking offense at that, right?

1168
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,040
Think of the offense we have at the comedian

1169
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,440
that has us know ourselves by some measure

1170
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,120
that is well beyond our capacity to self-determine,

1171
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,560
to auto-poeticize, and to manage for ourselves.

1172
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,680
We take offense at the idea that we could be so known

1173
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,320
and so naked by some measure

1174
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,440
that we have not the control over.

1175
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,160
We take offense at the idea that we do not know ourselves.

1176
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,000
Yes, exactly, and we refuse to be known.

1177
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,360
You shall not know me,

1178
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,800
I shall not know myself through you.

1179
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,360
No, I shall not.

1180
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,240
I refuse that love.

1181
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,600
Remember, knowing and love,

1182
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,720
we've made this identity claim before.

1183
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,840
I refuse that love,

1184
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,040
I refuse your knowing,

1185
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,000
I refuse the knowing of myself on your terms

1186
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,920
because they are not mine.

1187
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,640
Our offense at the comedian is in some sense

1188
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,160
a version of our offense at the Christ.

1189
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,720
So it's the opposite of the Socratic know-thyself

1190
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,000
as the aspirational, right?

1191
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,760
And it's mythology going back to that term again, right?

1192
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Okay, so again, this is deepening the point

1193
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,680
about this sort of primary orientation,

1194
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,680
the fundamental framing, the meta-optimal grip,

1195
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,680
the meta-orientation,

1196
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,760
the orientation to our orientation, right?

1197
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,200
That we're bringing into the practices, right?

1198
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,280
We're adding all of this nuance.

1199
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:48,440
We're building the mythos around, right?

1200
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,360
We're building a mythos scaffolding

1201
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,080
to help people take up the orientation

1202
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,640
that is needed for practicing dialectic into the elogues.

1203
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,840
That's right, that's right.

1204
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,280
So,

1205
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,280
so what,

1206
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,920
what do we, like, what am I trying to say?

1207
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,000
We've hit something, just.

1208
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,120
Yeah, no, no.

1209
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, there's an aporia here.

1210
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,400
Hold it for a second, yeah.

1211
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,920
But there's a connection too.

1212
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,200
Because I can think of, like this stance

1213
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,600
of being able to challenge the ethical in service

1214
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,920
of religio, the connectedness, the relatedness.

1215
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,320
The ratio religio, right?

1216
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,120
And I'm thinking not only of, like we,

1217
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:48,120
there are, I think the proper practice of this

1218
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,360
within a spiritual community dialectic into the elogues.

1219
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,640
I'm thinking of work that people like David Fuller

1220
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,120
and others are doing of having the conversations

1221
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,400
that we're not allowed to have.

1222
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,440
Not because we want to espouse a racism or a sexism

1223
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,640
or any kind of unethical behavior,

1224
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,400
but because we want to seek beyond these ethical frameworks

1225
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,160
a way of re-grounding the ethical in something

1226
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,000
that it is in the service of, right?

1227
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,280
And that we can't have these conversations.

1228
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:27,520
And so what I'm thinking of is another dimension

1229
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,280
of the scaffolding, which is,

1230
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,360
and this is of course requires tremendous care

1231
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,560
in both the sense of caution and taking care of,

1232
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,400
that in addition to what we just said,

1233
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,640
getting this finesse between taking ourselves too seriously

1234
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,520
and not taking ourselves seriously enough.

1235
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,680
Dialectic in the elogues also requires an ability

1236
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,640
to talk about things that we're not supposed to talk about,

1237
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,680
to have the difficult conversations.

1238
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,680
And to understand that those conversations are,

1239
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,720
they're not the end and object.

1240
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,360
No, because the conversations are not driven

1241
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,200
towards coming to a conclusion.

1242
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:13,240
They're trying to get us both to a kind of giving birth

1243
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,920
to ourselves that we're not capable on our own.

1244
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,520
And so like just as an example on it,

1245
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,440
I'm not going to get into it

1246
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,160
because YouTube is not the place to do this,

1247
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,160
but there is so much invocation of justice right now

1248
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,120
and so little deologos about justice,

1249
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,880
which Socrates and Plato and the Republic

1250
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,880
would find so abhorrent, so deeply, deeply disgusting.

1251
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,160
And that's what I mean about standing back and saying,

1252
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,280
why are we invoking this so much?

1253
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,880
And yet we pretend it's pretentious

1254
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,560
as if we completely get what justice is

1255
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,600
and we know it and we have it and we've got it

1256
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,800
and there's no question.

1257
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,280
And it's like, to me, that is also an example

1258
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,400
of people stuck in the ethical, right?

1259
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,640
The reduction of justice to law,

1260
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,400
the reduction of justice to law,

1261
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,160
whether it be formally or informally,

1262
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,120
however we define it, right?

1263
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,120
But that non-identity is precise

1264
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,080
that has a non-identity.

1265
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,960
I want to have deep discussions like this.

1266
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,320
I want to get into deologos like Socrates does

1267
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,440
in the Republic about justice.

1268
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,520
And I feel like we can't do it right now

1269
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,560
because anything that we say

1270
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,440
that calls particular slogans about justice

1271
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,840
into proper question for reflection

1272
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,840
will brand us immediately as unethical individuals.

1273
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,600
Right, well, but this goes to Beck,

1274
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,680
and this is as you know,

1275
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
we can gesture to dozens of hours of lectures

1276
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,560
to this effect.

1277
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,160
This is one of the consequences

1278
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,000
of the meaning crisis.

1279
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,040
Yes, yes.

1280
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,380
Is that the loss of the religious category

1281
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,380
of thought and action has resulted in the idolatry.

1282
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,360
The idolatry of the ethical.

1283
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,240
Right, and that's why we have pseudo-religious,

1284
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,160
meta-meaning systems, systems that were meaningful

1285
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,440
but not meta-meaningful,

1286
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,000
that had no capacity to govern intercategorically

1287
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,460
the way that we arrange meaning, right?

1288
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,000
Like political ideologies

1289
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,840
that have no business being religious

1290
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,840
but are elevated and deified to that category

1291
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,320
because they are.

1292
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,360
They're trying to fill the vacuum.

1293
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,720
They're trying to fill the vacuum

1294
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,840
and it is a deeply, deeply dangerous case

1295
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,280
of mistaken identity.

1296
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,480
Yes, yes.

1297
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,920
Right, and we can just like, you know, the examples are so,

1298
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,640
they're so voluminous, they're so obvious.

1299
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,360
We don't even need to enumerate them

1300
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,200
but they're rife right now.

1301
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,960
And it's because when we lose that category of orientation

1302
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,400
we drop a tear down.

1303
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,720
It's a pretty significant tear, right?

1304
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,520
It's a difference of kind, fundamentally.

1305
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,080
But it's exactly parallel, proportionally parallel

1306
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,360
to the person living the aesthetic life

1307
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,360
who, right, tries to.

1308
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,720
The Puerta Ernest, yeah.

1309
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,320
Yeah, yeah, right, who's trying

1310
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,920
to find a spiritual, right?

1311
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,720
He's even trying to, there's a vacuum

1312
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,120
of ethical orientation.

1313
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,880
Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

1314
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
Well, as you pointed out, I think very wisely yesterday

1315
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,120
when we talk about the aesthetic

1316
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,760
and it's a rough mapping but I think it's very apt.

1317
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,200
It's to the aesthetic and the ethical and the religious

1318
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,360
as the child is the adult, the adult is the aesthetic.

1319
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,040
Right, the child is the aesthetic,

1320
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,880
the adult is the ethical and the sage is the religious.

1321
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,240
And incidentally, I mean, I think we've made this clear

1322
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,400
but just in case there is necessary

1323
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,000
and independent value in each of these stages, right?

1324
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:49,840
Of course.

1325
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,400
We don't want to lose, we don't want to lose

1326
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,080
the ideality of playfulness that belongs

1327
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,240
to the province of the child.

1328
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,480
There's a reason that Kierkegaard

1329
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,800
really got along with kids, right?

1330
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,840
And in Jesus, you have to be like children

1331
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,680
to enter the kingdom.

1332
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,120
That's right, that's right.

1333
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,480
Our development comes through serious play, right?

1334
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Which children, of course, exemplify, right?

1335
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,240
And of course, there is tremendous value

1336
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,960
to the ethical, right?

1337
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,880
And you see the great figures, like Socrates,

1338
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,360
criticizing the laws of Athens

1339
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,280
but refusing to leave when they have pronounced his death.

1340
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,480
Jesus saying, I haven't come to throw away the law

1341
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:33,480
but to fulfill it, right?

1342
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,560
And you get these constant,

1343
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,520
where you get St. Paul.

1344
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,880
Once again, the paradox of that.

1345
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,640
Right, wrestling between law and love, right?

1346
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,480
Or the parable of the prodigal son,

1347
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,040
where if you, like the prodigal son for me

1348
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,320
is I come back to it again and again

1349
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,120
because if you land on any one of the identities

1350
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,800
and absolutize it, you don't get the parable.

1351
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,560
And that's the classic, and that is that by definition,

1352
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,640
I think by Schindler's definition is what mythology is,

1353
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,920
that the denial of the logos, the hate of the logos

1354
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,160
is mistaking the part for the whole.

1355
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,200
Mistaking any, the part of any one of these perspectives,

1356
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,000
the part of any one of these stages

1357
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,560
as being absolute in itself,

1358
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,800
rather than being something that participates in what is.

1359
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,960
And let's add the two things to it.

1360
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,360
They go exactly with it.

1361
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,720
The mythology is also that the logos

1362
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,440
is always instrumental and in service of something else.

1363
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,280
Yes, but what is all of this for?

1364
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,920
What if it's for what it is, right?

1365
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,520
It's about the abundant life, the life worth living.

1366
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,040
And then the other is, well, let's get to a conclusion.

1367
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,080
Let's get to the bottom line, right?

1368
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,240
Give me something final.

1369
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,080
What's the bottom line in the parable of the prodigal son?

1370
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,040
You tell me.

1371
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,360
What's the bottom line in the crucifixion?

1372
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,360
What's the bottom line in Socrates' trial?

1373
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,040
Like, you're not understanding it.

1374
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,480
Exactly, exactly.

1375
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,400
And so mythology is also that which has us take offense

1376
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,280
at the possibility of agape,

1377
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,240
which is a form of knowing and being known

1378
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,880
that is inexhaustible and is not brought to anything

1379
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,200
so final as what is so desired.

1380
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,840
Right, and therefore it is also,

1381
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,760
and this is one of the great, to my mind,

1382
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,480
one of the reasons why I think Christianity

1383
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,640
hasn't profunded it yet,

1384
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,320
which is the deep co-identification

1385
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,960
of agape and the logos, right?

1386
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,560
Because the mythology is not only the foreclosure

1387
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,600
on agape, it is the foreclosure, therefore also,

1388
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,360
of the logos, and we have to understand them.

1389
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,000
And I think in this paradox that he talks about,

1390
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,000
in this paradox, they are co-identified.

1391
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,000
So there's a way in which, right,

1392
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,760
and I'm not, I don't propose we resolve it right now,

1393
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,760
but what I'm seeing, again, to help get people oriented,

1394
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,680
is I'm seeing this interplay between comedy and tragedy,

1395
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,640
not taking ourselves too seriously.

1396
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,000
In order to take ourselves seriously.

1397
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,160
Right, right, and then there's also this interplay

1398
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,800
between logos and agape, and they're like,

1399
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:03,920
I see them as these opponent things,

1400
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,280
and then there's the nexus between them,

1401
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,400
and that's the place we wanna be in

1402
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,240
when we are exercising the practice.

1403
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,800
Yes, and it is not a place that we can articulate.

1404
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,080
No. It is ineffable.

1405
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,080
No, no, but what we can do, we can live in it.

1406
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,000
Yeah, we can live it, and we can triangulate ways

1407
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,640
in which, like Tillich, in which we can find the tonos,

1408
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,880
and we can find the tonos,

1409
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,400
and we can find the tonos between the different, right,

1410
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,040
and where they touch on each other and bear on each other.

1411
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:30,960
That's right.

1412
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,400
Yeah.

1413
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,480
I think this was wonderful.

1414
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,240
I think this was fantastic.

1415
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,240
So thank you so, so much.

1416
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,200
This was excellent.

1417
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,040
It was.

1418
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,000
Can I maybe just finish us off with one more?

1419
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,480
Oh, please.

1420
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:47,400
Because this one is, this one is a little less obvious,

1421
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,040
but I think all the better for it.

1422
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,000
So bear with me.

1423
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Okay. Bear with me.

1424
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:52,960
Bear with me.

1425
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,920
Instantly transforming oneself,

1426
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,520
how to become a jellyfish.

1427
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,360
And the question is,

1428
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,760
how does the self acquire its own selfhood

1429
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,040
if it is merely a receptacle for absorbing external values?

1430
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,200
There was a creature about which I fall into reverie rather often.

1431
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,000
It is the jellyfish.

1432
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,200
Have you noticed how this gelatinous mass

1433
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,280
can flatten itself into a plate

1434
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,560
and then slowly sink, then rise so still and firm

1435
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,800
that one would think one could step on it?

1436
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,520
Now notice, now it notices its prey approaching,

1437
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,920
then it funnels into itself,

1438
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,520
becomes a pouch and sinks with prodigious speed,

1439
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,200
deeper and deeper with its speed snatching in its prey.

1440
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,720
Not into its pouch, for it does not have a pouch,

1441
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,640
but into itself, for it is itself a pouch and nothing else.

1442
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
It is so able to contract itself

1443
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,640
that one cannot imagine how it could possibly extend itself.

1444
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,640
It is just about the same with you.

1445
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,640
And you must forgive me that I have not had

1446
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,640
a more beautiful creature with which to compare you.

1447
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,640
And also that you perhaps can hardly keep from smiling

1448
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,640
at the thought of yourself as nothing but a pouch.

1449
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,640
That is so consonant with everything,

1450
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,640
like we've been talking about and also, you know,

1451
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:25,640
being tracking Socrates and trying to follow the logos.

1452
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,640
And it also reminds me of L.A. Paul's stuff

1453
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,640
about people offering to turn you into a vampire

1454
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,640
and you can't possibly know what that is like.

1455
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,640
But the humor gets you into the serious play

1456
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,640
between the perspectives.

1457
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,640
That was perfect for ending it.

1458
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,640
Thank you so much.

1459
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:46,640
Thank you, everyone.

1460
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,640
For your time and attention.

1461
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,640
Take good care.

1462
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,640
Kierkegaard seems to be also presenting it

1463
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,640
as a positive and good thing,

1464
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,640
but he's suffering it in this profound way.

1465
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,640
This is what I'm hearing you saying.

1466
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,640
This is almost ripping him to pieces.

1467
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,640
And yet in Socrates,

1468
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,640
it seems to be sitting there harmoniously together.
