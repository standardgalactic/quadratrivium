1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Welcome, everyone. I've been really looking forward to this particular voices with Reveke.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,760
You're no doubt looking at somebody who you've heard, many of you have heard me mention multiple

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:18,560
times. Cytus' work and his influence are repeatedly a huge impact on me and somebody I've gotten to

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,680
know on a somewhat more personal level. We were colleagues. I taught his son at one point,

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,000
well, multiple points, I think. He's just a fantastic and, I think, important thinker in

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
the field of cognitive science. I think he's probably one of the most premier, if not the

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,360
premier person, representing what's called for ecogsci. That, I think, is very pertinent

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,600
to questions that we're wrestling with around the nature of meaning, etc. I'm going to just

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,520
turn things over to my friend Evan Thompson and ask him to give us a little bit more of the

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
background that he thinks might be relevant. Then we'll move to the issue at hand.

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,400
Yeah. I am first and foremost a philosopher. That's my academic training. I work in the

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
areas of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, both theoretical cognitive science and collaborating

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,160
with experimental scientists. I also have a strong interest in Asian philosophy. My undergraduate

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,000
training was in Asian studies, Chinese language and history. I got drawn into philosophy really

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,800
through studying Chinese philosophy. I went the reverse path from the path that sometimes

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:44,240
people take from east to west in my case academically. I have a continuing interest in

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,480
the conversation between Asian philosophical traditions and Western philosophy.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,960
I also have a strong interest in phenomenology, the tradition coming from Edmund Husserl.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
That plays a strong role. The phenomenological tradition plays a strong role in the most recent

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,280
book, The Blind Spot. Which is what we're going to turn to. Evan just referred to it. This is it.

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,480
I want to strongly recommend this book, especially for people who are interested in

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,320
the meaning crisis. It is the central topic of this book. It is called The Crisis in Meaning,

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,480
the Meaning Crisis, The Blind Spot. The Blind Spot is a particular account and explanation of

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,320
the meaning crisis. This book is written with Adam Frank, Marcello Glycer, or Gleaser, is it

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,440
Glycer? Glycer, Marcello Glycer, yeah. And Evan Thompson is the third author. When I got this

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,280
book, I opened it and I was like, whoa, things that are near and dear to my heart and to my work

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,000
and my besetting obsessions, the meaning crisis was there. And then there's this notion of the

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
blind spot, which we'll unpack in a minute. And I turned to chapter nine on cognition as I often do

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,280
in any book, because that's my shtick. And the blind spot in cognition was explicitly named as

30
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,320
relevance realization, something else near and dear to my heart. And so as soon as I saw that,

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:11,280
I hadn't read any more of the book, I just read about 10 pages here and looked at the chapter

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,000
and I went, oh, wow. And I showed my partner the book and I was like so excited about it. So I

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
reached out to Evan right away and I said, you got to come on, we got to talk about this. Your

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,280
work and my work really talk to each other really deeply at this point. The book, just some basic

35
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,320
things, the book is wonderful. I'm talking now sort of rhetorically, it's clearly written,

36
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,720
it's accessible. I wouldn't say it's like a beach read, like you're just going to sit there and

37
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,440
write. You have to put thought into it. It demands, it provokes and demands reflection

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,120
and consideration. But it is also not pitched to the academic hoi paloi or anything like that.

39
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,560
It is really written as I think it should be given the topic to a general educated audience

40
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
of people who are concerned with the meaning crisis and how we get here and what it is and

41
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
what is this meaning we're talking about and how can we ameliorate it. So first of all,

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,560
book is really wonderfully written, very clear. Now the thing I want to ask you very quickly

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,040
about and unpack this a little bit before we get into the meat of it, this book has a very

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
single voice to it. Sometimes you know when you're reading books by multiple authors, you hear this,

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,080
you get the sense of a carcophony and it's, you know, and you use we throughout and everything,

46
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,600
you're reminding the reader constantly as you should. But the voice has, I find the clear

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,640
integrated voice, like how did that come about and how did you make that happen?

48
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,120
Well, I'm glad that it reads that way. Obviously that was, you know, that was a challenge in

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:05:00,240
writing a book with three authors. And I would say that the responsibility for really doing the

50
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,160
overall smoothing as we called it and kind of unifying of tone and narrative that that was

51
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,560
really part of my role as the writer. Each chapter was written in a first draft initially

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,560
by one of the three of us. So Adam Frank, you know, took the lead on the Quantum Mechanics chapter,

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
Marcelo Gleister took the lead on the Cosmology chapter, I took the lead on, you know, the

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,400
Cognition Consciousness and the Introduction chapters. But then we each, you know, wrote over

55
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,320
each other's drafts. And then when we felt that we all were sort of on the same page with regard

56
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,640
to what we were saying, then it was really my job to smooth it out and just give it a unified voice

57
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,320
and tone. Which I'm happy to hear you say you think it works because, you know, when you're

58
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,800
doing something like that, you don't want to remove the particular, you know, the special

59
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,480
things that each author has in the way they articulate something, the way they write something,

60
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,960
you don't want to just remove that and flatten things. But on the other hand, you can't have really

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,120
very different styles in the same chapter, let alone the same book. So that definitely took

62
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,000
some work. But I enjoyed that work actually, I found it very satisfying and it enabled me to

63
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,840
really deeply think through each chapter with materials that, you know, I'm not an expert on,

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,840
you know, quantum mechanics, cosmology, the physics of time. I mean, these are not my areas

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,680
of expertise. I have an interest in them from a philosophy of science angle, but that's not,

66
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,600
you know, to be a scientist in those areas. So I learned a lot from doing that.

67
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,120
Well, that's interesting. And I won't open this up as rabbit hole, although maybe we'll return

68
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
to it. I mean, I've been doing a lot of work right now on dialogical reason as opposed to

69
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,240
monological reason and a lot of the emerging evidence about how it has a lot of capacities

70
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,520
to overcome bias and to be more clear and complex at the same time that you get with

71
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,600
monological. So I welcome that, the fact that this was sort of dialogically produced.

72
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
So in order to flesh that out a little bit more, can you tell me a little bit more about Adam and

73
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,960
Marcello? Yeah, so Adam Frank is an astronomer and astrophysicist at the University of Rochester.

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,920
He works on a number of different things in science and he's written a number of more general

75
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:38,240
audience books. Marcelo Gleiser is a theoretical physicist and he's also, you know, done a number

76
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
of different things in the scientific domains as well as having written a number of popular books.

77
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,320
So the way that we wound up writing this book is that Marcello

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,880
directed for I think about five or six years at Dartmouth College where he's based an institute

79
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,840
for cross disciplinary engagement, ICE. And he invited, you know, fellows each year to come and

80
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,680
be there for a couple of weeks and give some talks and just interact with the community there.

81
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:18,000
And he invited Adam and me, I think it would have been 2016 or 2017, I don't remember,

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,880
so we were both there together. And we just started talking and at one point in our conversations

83
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,320
about, you know, science and experience, this term, the blind spot sort of popped into our

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,840
conversation and then we just kept sort of working on it, the three of us, and eventually

85
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,000
it became clear that, you know, we had something that we wanted to write. So it really came out

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,840
of conversations, our collaboration as a result of Marcello's having this kind of special

87
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,440
intellectual setting where he was inviting scientists and philosophers and historians and

88
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:02,960
religious teachers, spiritual teachers as well, also to the center. And so their background is

89
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,840
really coming out of physics and history of science and then the conversation between us

90
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,680
was what launched the book. That's excellent. So there's a good representation both from the

91
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:24,000
history and the philosophy of science going into this book. So I want you to unpack the

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,400
core argument. No, and people do this to me all the time. Can you summarize Awakening Tim from

93
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:40,320
the meeting crisis? Right. Yeah. So we'll give you time and space, but when you do that, though,

94
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,640
can you talk a little bit about how at least these figures show up in the introduction? They

95
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,920
show up sort of throughout, but you know, Nishita and Whitehead and then Cartwright,

96
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
three philosophers at least, that's maybe the best category they all belong to,

97
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,360
are playing a pivotal role. Cartwright I'm unfamiliar with. I've just purchased a couple

98
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,720
of her books because of the blind spot, so thank you for that. Now, Whitehead and Nishita,

99
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm doing a lot of work on and I've been doing this on and off for several years, but

100
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:28,240
I mean, they have a notion about this idea that in some way, I'll use Whitehead's idea here.

101
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,640
We've gotten into kind of a performative contradictions where we're making statements

102
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,240
about reality, and then I'll use Nishita from a standpoint that isn't consistent with those

103
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,840
statements. So, and many people on watching my channel, I've made this argument about scientists

104
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,280
making pronouncements about everything above the level of the quantum being an illusion,

105
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,560
and then it's like, but then you're basing those statements on all these illusory machines and

106
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,720
gauges and illusory conferences and like, what? How are you drawing deep conclusions about the

107
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,840
ultimate nature of reality from all this illusory material and that there's a performative contradiction?

108
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,600
I don't know if this is the actual source, but I credit Whitehead was sort of the first person

109
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,240
to really put his finger on that performative contradiction, although I've seen Nishita doing

110
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,640
something very similar, especially when he gets to Basho, when he's talking about Basho. So,

111
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,200
what is the argument and why the term the blind spot, which I found really helpful

112
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:48,240
as an enacted metaphor for this? Right. So, maybe we'll start with the metaphor of the blind spot.

113
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,040
So, the blind spot in the way that we're using the term is a metaphor from the blind spot in

114
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:06,160
the individual field that we have that all mammals have, actually. And it's the area of the retina

115
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:16,640
where the optic nerve leaves and projects inward into the brain. And because there are no

116
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,840
light sensitive receptor cells, where that bundle of nerve fibers enters into the brain,

117
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,760
we don't see anything in the blind spot. There's no possibility of visual sensitivity

118
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
to what's in the blind spot. But we also don't see that we have a blind spot because

119
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,960
the situation is the eyes are constantly darting about and the blind spots of the two eyes are

120
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,000
different. And so, as it is said, we sort of fill in across the blind spot. So,

121
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,160
we have a blind spot, an area within the visual field in which we don't see and we don't see

122
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:58,800
that we don't see. So, this is a metaphor for the idea that in our scientific world view,

123
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,440
there is something that makes science possible, that is the, you could say, the source of science.

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,920
But we don't see it and we don't see that we don't see it. And what it is, and now we could

125
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,840
use different words for this. What it is, is lived experience, direct experience, immediate

126
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:29,120
intuition, pure awareness, these terms that thinkers like William James and Kitara Nishida,

127
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,000
and also figures in literature in the 19th turn of the 20th century are interested in

128
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,680
stream of consciousness. All of these thinkers as modern science is becoming this tremendously

129
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,520
powerful epistemic accomplishment. All of these thinkers are Whitehead, Husserl, the phenomenologists,

130
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,960
they're all grappling with this recognition that there is an experiential source to our knowledge

131
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,960
that we systematically occlude when we think about the nature of that knowledge. And the way that we

132
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,280
do that, it takes different forms, but the way that we do that in how we think about science

133
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:18,400
is that we step back, we look for invariance across perspectives, we look for things that we can

134
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:28,160
objectify and quantify across a community of observers, forgetting that those things actually

135
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,360
depend on and arise out of a background of lived experience. And then we objectify them in a way

136
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,160
where we take them to be more fundamental than the experience that underpins them.

137
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,800
And that's the sort of crucial move in what we call the blind spot, is this treatment of what

138
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
comes about through a certain method, let's call it a method of objectification, which is a very

139
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,400
powerful and very useful method. We're not arguing against the method as such, but when you forget

140
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,840
that it's a method and you take it for the being of what you're studying in a way that makes that

141
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,840
being more fundamental than the experience that's animating the method, then what you've done is,

142
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,600
and here we really rely on Husserl in the crisis of European science, you substitute a method for

143
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,360
being, which is like a category error, and Husserl calls this the surreptitious substitution.

144
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,440
You substitute a method that you've arrived at, Husserl identifies it as arising really most

145
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,880
powerfully in Galileo, where Galileo imagines the world with no sentient creatures. He then

146
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,120
treats nature in terms of mathematical properties, where the mathematical properties,

147
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,160
the method for him is geometry, the mathematical properties are then taken to be the actual

148
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,920
being and reality of the universe from a god's eye point of view that sees the language in which

149
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,120
nature is written. That move of substituting a method for being, that's the surreptitious

150
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,280
substitution that's built into the blind spot. The connection to whitehead is that whitehead,

151
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,880
there's two concepts in whitehead that are important for us. For whiteheadians out there,

152
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,680
I would say that we're really working here from what is sometimes called whitehead's middle period,

153
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,880
so the concept of nature is a really important book for us, and also science in the modern world,

154
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,080
which is a little bit later. Whitehead says there's, in the epistemology that gets attached

155
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,760
to modern science, or to natural philosophy, you could say there's a bifurcation of nature,

156
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,680
where we say, as Galileo did, what's objective and fundamentally real are the

157
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,560
mathematical properties, and the qualities, the lived experience, that's subjective.

158
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,320
In a way, it gets kicked outside of nature. That's the bifurcation. It gets kicked outside,

159
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,160
because if nature is that which is mathematical, and those qualities have to be removed in order

160
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
to mathematicalize nature, then what are you going to do with those qualities that are residing,

161
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,360
as it were in the mind? Well, the mind then gets excised from nature. Whitehead is insistent on

162
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,520
saying, even from the standpoint of natural philosophy, you cannot do that, because the

163
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,080
lived, sensuous qualities belong to nature. The task is to create a system of relations

164
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,520
that treats them on the same level playing field and integrates them. To think that

165
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,080
the abstractions, the mathematical abstractions, are what nature really is. Whitehead calls that

166
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,920
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, because you've got an abstraction that you concretize,

167
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,080
and no, what's concrete is, in Whitehead's terms, it's the sensuous experience or the sense

168
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,320
awareness in which nature is given to us in terms of passage and duration and flow out of which we

169
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,200
abstract things like space, time, continuum, and so on. That's what we set up in the beginning

170
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,000
of the book, where the blind spot, just to maybe succinctly summarize it, the blind spot is

171
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,160
the inability to see or to recognize or to acknowledge that lived experience is the source of

172
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:28,000
science. If you undercut the source of science by occluding lived experience, this is central to

173
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,280
our argument, you're actually damaging science, because you're removing the epistemic footing

174
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:44,000
that it needs to be the powerful investigative method it is. What happens is you get this

175
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,920
symptomatic of the meaning crisis in our culture, you get this oscillation between the extreme of

176
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,560
science triumphalism, which is science is the greatest method ever, and the world is what

177
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,680
science tells us it is, on the one hand, and then you get science denial, on the other hand,

178
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,920
because a very natural reaction to science triumphalism is to say, well, that's not how I

179
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:10,000
experience the world, regardless of what you say, and in a world of rapid transmission of

180
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,160
information and misinformation and willful misleading of people, that oscillation between

181
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,200
science triumphalism and science denial becomes particularly problematic and pernicious.

182
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,160
That's sort of the setup of the book at the very beginning.

183
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:33,040
That was great. That oscillation is, I mean, it also comes to the fore in some ways in

184
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
it. I don't know if it's the same, but it resonates with the oscillation. We have an

185
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,360
instability in our sense of realness. We have these two, right? We have the mathematical sense

186
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,280
of realness and Descartes played with both to no resolution, or we have this, you know, the core

187
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,960
of where consciousness is present to itself as what is most real, and we also vacillate between

188
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,320
those. I don't know if they are identical, but at least they seem to be tracking also between

189
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,760
science triumphalism and science denialism. I thought that was beautiful. It sounds like you're,

190
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,760
and this is a bit of Nishita in it, you're picking up on that the blind spot, we're not only

191
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,800
unaware of it, but it is also simultaneously the source of our ability to see.

192
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,040
You're right, right? Because the optic, right? And Nishitani builds on this. It's the not the

193
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:38,640
thing that makes it accessible to us and that sort of thing. So that move is really interesting to

194
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,360
me. This idea of grounding, and you use that term a couple of times in source, you use that term a lot.

195
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,800
So what would you say to somebody who says, well, what do you mean? I mean,

196
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,480
isn't there a difference between the epistemological order of how I come to

197
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,560
knowledge and the ontological order of what that knowledge discloses? Yeah, I have to start in sense

198
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:13,920
experience and etc, etc. But that doesn't mean that that ordering of my epistemological endeavor is

199
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:20,000
the same as the order of reality or how it unfolds. I know that you're ready for this, but I want to

200
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,760
hear what you have to say about it. Sure, sure. Well, this depends on what ordering means. So

201
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,120
I mean, at one level, it certainly is something that needs to be recognized that the

202
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:41,760
procedure by which we disclose something is one thing, and that which is disclosed is another thing.

203
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,840
The ordering, though, if it's a hierarchical ordering in terms of

204
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:56,320
fundamentals goes beyond just that recognition, because it says what's ontologically fundamental

205
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:04,960
is, let's say, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the properties as

206
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:14,080
mathematical. And the experience is derivative. The problem with that ordering is that

207
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,640
the mathematical properties exist at a different level of intelligibility

208
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,160
from the concrete phenomena. And they are, if you will, the map and the territory is the

209
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:36,720
concrete phenomena. And if you, if you assume that the territory just is the particular map

210
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,520
in the way that you're able to render it using, you know, the tools of, of objectification and

211
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:52,240
mathematics, that's, that's actually to not see that. So let me give a concrete illustration,

212
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,840
because this is a very abstract way of putting it. So, so one of the things we talk about is time.

213
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,320
And so we have the idea that, you know, from a, from the standpoint of physics clock, you know,

214
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:13,200
time is what clocks measure. That's fine as a method. But if you then say, well, what time is

215
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,440
is what a clock measures, you've forgotten that there needs to be clock readers, and they exist

216
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:27,760
in some window of duration, that's, that's a continuous flow that disappears if you, if you

217
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,800
try to reconstruct it in terms of, you know, point-like instance and clock readings. So

218
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,040
So I want to make sure I'm tracking. You're saying something like there's a kind of time

219
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,440
in clock reading that is presupposed in measuring time with a clock.

220
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,760
Exactly. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So, so there was just a review of the blind spot in

221
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,560
LA review of books by Robert Crease, who's a philosopher of physics, also writes, you know,

222
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,320
general books about, about science. And he had a wonderful statement that I, that I wish we had

223
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,680
actually thought of. And let me see if I can, if I can, if I can get it exactly. So he, he says,

224
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,760
describing our view, no one pulls out a clock to know what time is, they pull out a clock to

225
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,680
know what time it is. So that's basically the idea, right? You already have to have some

226
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,520
experience of time. And you might say sort of to use a, use a phenomenological term, a kind of,

227
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,240
you know, pre-understanding of time in order to be able to recognize a clock as at all relevant

228
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,600
to, you know, to the, to the subject phenomenon that you're immersed in. So the ordering, so the

229
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,400
just to go back to the ordering point. So the ordering is, is, is what we object to is the

230
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,200
sort of hierarchical ordering in terms of fundamentality, where we say experience is not

231
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,560
fundamental, or what's disclosed to us of the world in how we experience it is derivative,

232
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:09,040
not fundamental. And what's fundamental is what we, what we're able to reveal through,

233
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,840
through say, mathematical models.

238
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,800
Okay, so there's two moves here, and I like both of them, because I've advocated for both of them.

239
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,280
So I hope, I hope this isn't just two members of the choir performing in front of the minister

240
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,640
or something like that. That's okay too. Because I've talked about, you know, even a naturalist

241
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
should be committed not only to what is derivable from your science, but what is presupposed by

242
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,520
the practice of your science. And that's exactly what you seem to be saying. You're right. Greg

243
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,400
Enriquez and I talk about that as extended naturalism. Right. And then the next one is,

244
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,200
and then this one may be, may be more controversial, but it sort of follows from the

245
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,760
first, there's an implicit judgment of realness. And I think, well, I hope you agree,

246
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:24,320
I take real as a comparative adjective, right. You know, Marla, people from Plato to Marla

247
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,960
Pondida Whitehead have said, you only judge one thing as an illusion by judging something

248
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,000
else as real. It's always comparative and vice versa. And so what I was hearing something like

249
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,560
fundamental, implying something like more real, and the idea is, I'm not happy with this term,

250
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,440
and we'll play with them a little bit later, but the concrete is more real than the abstract.

251
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
Because of something like, and you say this multiple times too, there's a richness, there's an

252
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,960
inexhaustible-ness to that. And this is the point about the map territory kind of,

253
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,080
the territory is way richer, has an inexhaustible, it overflows any particular map, even a globe,

254
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,920
even a Earth-Science globe, et cetera, et cetera. Is that, that's very, so for me,

255
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,840
just as we're sort of putting cards on the table, that's the influence of Polania on me. He was

256
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,120
proposing that as the mark of what he calls contact with reality. And Esther, like Kat Mead,

257
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,000
has talked about that in her book of the same title. This inexhaustible-ness, but it's not

258
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,960
carcophonist inexhaustible, and we'll play with that a little bit. It's kind of like an inexhaustible

259
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,680
fountain of intelligibility, right? And so is that, is that, is that what I think of it?

260
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:45,200
Yeah, so that's very much it. I mean, another way that I think of it is that our being always

261
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,640
is more than or overflows our knowing, because knowing happens through certain means,

262
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,440
through certain methods, through certain sensory systems, through certain forms of

263
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,960
intelligibility, and our being is always larger than that. It always overflows that, yeah.

264
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,240
So that would, that's wonderful, Evan. I've got to slow down. I'm very enthusiastic.

265
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:15,600
So that, that means that, well, let me form it as a question. Is it possible that one,

266
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,400
because I've made an argument that one of the contributors to the meaning crisis is we've reduced

267
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,480
many kinds of knowing that have many different kinds of memory attached to them, procedural,

268
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,360
episodic, autonometric, have different criteria of realness to them, skill is power,

269
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,560
you know, perspectival knowing is sort of like noticing, getting that sense of,

270
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,880
you know, getting deeper into things, more present to them. And then the participatory

271
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,360
knowing is the sense of sort of belonging, fittedness to your environment. And what I mean by that

272
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,560
is part of, I hear you saying this, but I want to frame it, like our practice, we've reduced what

273
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:01,440
knowing is, and we forgot, when we do that, we've forgot the ultimate responsibility of

274
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,240
knowing to being, like particularly our being, but also being in general, like we forgot that

275
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,800
there are ways of knowing that are more, or are closer metaphor to our being in the world than

276
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,720
these mathematical abstractions. Is that also tracking? Oh, definitely. Yeah, no, definitely. I think

277
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,560
there are different kinds of knowing, there are different modes of knowing, I suppose you might

278
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:37,120
say, different ways of delineating those, of course, too. And it's, because science is so

279
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:47,760
transformatively powerful, in its outward, you know, obvious manifestations, we have defaulted

280
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,720
to thinking, and I mean, you see this explicitly in Descartes, right? We have defaulted to thinking

281
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,520
that knowing is a matter of having a method. And that's true for some methods of knowing.

282
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,520
But even the application of a method presupposes something that you can't, you know,

283
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,800
state in terms of a method, right? I mean, this is a familiar kind of thing for philosophers.

284
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah. So, yeah, no, that's right. There's a kind of acquaintance, you could say,

285
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,520
that we have with our being, that is not a matter of having a method. That acquaintance is not

286
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,440
unproblematic, of course. I mean, all sorts of questions arise in relation to that, you know,

287
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,200
normative questions, existential questions, philosophical questions, ethical, political, of

288
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:42,400
course. But it's the background for the application of any method, exactly.

289
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,360
Well, I was smiling because, and I know you're aware of this, because you treated about it,

290
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,000
you know, with Johannes Yeager and Anna Riedel and Aldrich Bedwick and Dennis Walsh.

291
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,720
We're trying to get a paper published on how you can't ultimately, you can't capture relevance

292
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,920
realization in computation for exactly that reason, that the process of formalization of

293
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,400
translating things into a formal system is always an ill-defined problem that requires

294
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,360
relevance realization. And that sort of, I mean, there's a lot more to that paper, but that's the

295
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,560
core kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, no, I love that paper and I completely agree and sympathize with

296
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:29,920
the argument. Yeah. Now, what's interesting, excellent answer to that question. So, I'm going

297
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,160
to throw out these, like, devil's advocate things and then you do this wonderful thing and we get

298
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,760
into some nice discussion. Well, somebody will say, bifurcation, come on, we've always bifurcated,

299
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,760
because we have to and we do, even in our lived experience, readily and reliably make

300
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,360
distinguishing distinctions between appearance and reality, fraud and reality, illusion and

301
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,600
reality, delusion and reality, hallucination and reality, right? And yeah, maybe we cut it up as

302
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,040
a subjective and objective, but the ancient world cut it up into the problem of the one in the mini.

303
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,040
We're always building these worldviews, trying to somehow give us a normative guide for how we

304
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:18,960
discern, you know, reality from appearance. And so, isn't a bifurcation an inevitable thing,

305
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:31,680
therefore? Yeah, so, of course, we always live in a world where we have to make distinctions

306
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,680
between, you know, the appearance of something and, as we say, how it really is. But if we think

307
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:44,800
about how that works, the test, the criterion, the standard for how something really is, is

308
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,280
disclosed in and through another experience. So, it's not that we step outside of experience and

309
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,400
we have some absolute standard or metric by which we can say, this is real and that isn't real. It's

310
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,960
rather that we continually open up new vistas, new horizons in experience where the relationship

311
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,760
between appearance and reality shifts within the sphere of experience itself. So, that's not really

312
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:22,000
bifurcation in Whitehead sense. That's a sort of progressive changing of appearances, perspectives,

313
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,080
you know, profiles, aspects of things where what we take to be true or real is something

314
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,680
disclosed, again, through experience where Whitehead, when he uses the term bifurcation

315
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,320
of nature, really means you kick experience out of the framework of scientific, the framework

316
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,720
of the scientific representation of nature. And then, and we know this very well today in terms

317
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,600
of the hard problem of consciousness, then you face a very, very fundamentally difficult problem

318
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:03,920
of how to recover consciousness, awareness, the mind. And the hard problem is that problem.

319
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,000
It's a problem that that derives in a way from the bifurcation of nature in the way that we state

320
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,880
the problem today, which is, you know, how is consciousness possible in a purely physical

321
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,720
world where we conceive the purely physical in terms of this bifurcation of, you know, a

322
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:29,360
mathematical, quantitative nature, that then somehow we have to find a room for the qualia,

323
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:34,880
the qualitative properties, the phenomenality, the appearances. And then we either, we do that by

324
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,880
either trying to, you know, be reductionist and say, well, it just really is physicality

325
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,600
in the face of the obvious sort of problem of conceptual intelligibility there.

326
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,880
Or we say, well, it actually is an illusion itself. We sort of go the illusionist route.

327
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,160
And then we strain at the intelligibility of the concept of an illusion. Or we, you know,

328
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,440
or we go panpsychist and we say, well, there's a sense in which consciousness and some minimal,

329
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,560
phenomenal sense is sort of an ingredient everywhere at all levels. So we sort of like

330
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,520
having sucked the consciousness out, we then sort of like spray it back into the universe

331
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,360
as it were everywhere. And that doesn't really work either. So that's the bifurcation. So,

332
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,560
so yes, of course, we have to make distinctions between appearance and reality, genuine counterfeit.

333
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,560
But we always do that within a framework of the test of experience.

334
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,440
So that's the key move. And I liked that. That was a great answer. And there was a moment in the

335
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,160
book. Sorry, I don't mean to indicate it was the only moment in the book. There was one moment

336
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,120
in the book, one among many, where I was, I was looking at this and I said, oh, I never put those

337
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,320
two together. I, you know, I talk, obviously, about, you know, the relationship to God and

338
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,800
the two worlds mythology. But you did this, you made this move where you said, you know, the thing

339
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,200
about the idea of this, I don't know what to call it, you know, the monarchical God or something

340
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,800
like that God, even when that God disappeared, we preserved the placeholder function of the

341
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:11,120
view from nowhere, right? And in there. And so what I hear you critiquing is that view from

342
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,200
nowhere possibility. It's like, yes, yes, there's reality, illusion, reality distinctions, but you

343
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,320
never are in the place from nowhere, no when to make that distinction. Is that, is that a fair way?

344
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,200
That's right. Exactly. I mean, if you read, if you read Newton or Galileo, you have this

345
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:41,040
this conception, a particular kind of conception of God as, as able to, you know, behold everything

346
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,200
at all times from all possible perspectives. You know, Newton says that, you know, space is God's

347
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,920
sensorium. So there's a sense of God can, can contemplate, you know, every, every possible

348
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,360
perspective of a thing in space. You, you have a, you have a conception of, of the outside view

349
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,640
and science, you know, is, it may never achieve that, but that's it's, it's ideal in a way.

350
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,160
And so that is very much what we're, what we're criticizing is no, that that's,

351
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:19,600
that's not how science works. And it's not how knowledge works. It's not how experience works.

352
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,480
So, so that's really good. And I want to, I want to, I want to shift back into Nishita just for a

353
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,680
sec. I forget where it's in Nishita, but Carter talks about it in his beautiful book, The Nothingness

354
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,920
Beyond God. He talks about Nishita's distinction between the transcendent, transcendent and the

355
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,120
imminent transcendent. Right. Right. Right. Because you, well, you qualified something,

356
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,480
and I think it was good that you did because some of my people listening to this,

357
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,600
you're, you're not the village atheist or something like that. That's not what's being

358
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:58,560
argued for here. And so, and I hear you're saying, well, that conception, the transcendent,

359
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,720
transcendent, that, that is probably given this argument, a performative contradiction of some

360
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,320
kind. Like it's, it's ultimately not conceivable to us, not just because we're limited or finite,

361
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,280
but because it is inherently, it severs itself from the very sources of meaning and understanding.

362
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,960
Is that, is that, that is, yeah. Whereas there's something like the notion of the imminent

363
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,160
transcendence, which you get, of course, in, in Whitehead, right? You have the, the emergence,

364
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,080
right? You, you have, and we can talk about whether or not you still like this language,

365
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,000
but you know, you have the eternal and the emergent and they're constantly resonating with

366
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,160
each other, but they're always bound together. Whitehead says, you know, God transcends the

367
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,480
world to the same degree that the world transcends God and God is imminent in the world to the same

368
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,880
degree the world is imminent in God. And I think that's very aligned with what Nashid is trying to

369
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:56,800
get at. Now, so you aren't responsible to every possible audience. I get that. But a lot of people

370
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,000
come to this and I think this is a fair point around the meaning crisis and they come to this

371
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,800
around the issue of sacredness because they say, yes, you're talking about reality and you're talking

372
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,200
about things can be more real. I can be closer. I can be more in conformity to it. I can live a,

373
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,400
perhaps a fuller life, a more responsible life. And there's a sense that that could even be sacred.

374
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,200
It could afford transforming me, making me a better person. And, you know, both Whitehead has,

375
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,320
has a God and Nashida talks a lot about God and he certainly has a sacred in it. So I know you're

376
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,800
not a theologian and I'm not, I'm not trying to bend you into something, but I think this is a fair

377
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,520
question. Because these questions around the meaning crisis bring up issues around, you know,

378
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,640
about sacredness and ultimacy. And what would you say about that? Would you say that?

379
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,760
Yeah, because there's a parallel. This is all final proposal for before I shut up and let you

380
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,800
answer the question. There's a parallel with religious denial and religious triumphalism,

381
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,680
I think, in a certain way. And, and maybe, you know, and you're, you're trying to get out of the one.

382
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,400
And I, I, I agree with you on that, the science and you're trying, and I've been trying to get

383
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,040
out of the other. And I'm wondering if you see relationship between them, particularly because

384
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,160
we're, and I want to get into this with you at some point. I think this meaning, what psychologists

385
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,040
call meaning in life, not semantic meaning, but this sense of connectedness to reality is what's

386
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,280
behind, you know, our judgments of what is, you know, most real and most sacred, most important

387
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,560
for us, etc. Do you think those two problems talk to each other? I know you don't, I haven't

388
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,560
like a whole book, maybe you talk about it in other places in the book, but do you think about it?

389
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,280
Yeah, no, those are really interesting thoughts and questions. That definitely goes beyond what

390
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,280
we talk about in the book. So we don't, I mean, I'm happy to talk about it here, but just, just

391
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,000
to be clear about the book, it's not, we don't really enter into issues about,

392
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:01,280
you might say larger issues about meaning that connect to, to religion or to the sacred or to

393
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,280
spirituality. You know, we may be allude to the certain aspects of them here and there,

394
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,520
but they're not, they're not a really dominant theme in the book that, you know, the book is

395
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,600
really circumscribed by the, by the effort to, you know, help us get clear about what science is

396
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,800
and how science works. But that, of course, immediately raises the question from, you know,

397
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,320
a larger perspective of how to think about science in relationship to philosophy or religion or to

398
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:42,000
issues about, about the sacred. This is difficult, you know, in a way to know exactly how to enter,

399
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,640
because, you know, the word, the word sacred can mean different things. The word, you know,

400
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,600
the word God can mean different things like whitehead has a very idiosyncratic

401
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,200
conception of God. I mean, it's been generative for process theology, but, but it's, it's, it's,

402
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,880
it's an outlying conception, even within the realm of theology.

403
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,280
So I would do how I'm using it and maybe and see if that's good enough. And I'm deeply influenced

404
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,840
here by a fellow Canadian, Schellenberg, and his idea of the triple transcendent. The sacred is

405
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:24,320
that which is, in some sense, ultimately real for us. It is ultimately transformative for us. It

406
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,600
has a sodorological function. It's not just an intellectual ascent. And then it has an

407
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:36,480
axiological, it serves as kind of an ultimate normative guide for us in some way and making

408
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,280
our ethical and aesthetic, even epistemological judgments. And, and, and, and other people

409
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,200
like Bracken and the Divine Matrix seem to be arguing that I'm not, I'm not saying this

410
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,480
is going to satisfy everybody, but maybe it's enough of a core so that we got something to work

411
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,480
with in answering the question I'm posing to you. Yeah. I guess the way that I have been

412
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,720
thinking about that recently, so that this isn't really worked out for me in a thorough way, but,

413
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,800
but, but I have thought about these things, you know, more in actually in relation to the

414
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,600
writings that I've done about Buddhism and religion and science in my, in my earlier book,

415
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,480
Why I'm Not a Buddhist. So there's an issue I would say about,

416
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,720
You're going to come on my show and talk to me about that book when I get to that book. I've had

417
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,800
that book on my shelf for a while and I apologize for that. But yeah, no worries. Yeah. Yeah. No,

418
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,200
that would be fun. So we might, we might use Tillick's idea of, you know, faith as ultimate

419
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,160
concern, like not to say that it has to stop there, but we can take that idea as an entry point.

420
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,320
I like Tillick a lot as you know, he's big. Yeah. So ultimate concern,

421
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
or, you know, we could, we could use the word sacred to mean ultimate concern as well. So,

422
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:57,680
so, you know, faith, sacred, ultimate concern. For me, one issue really has to do with a juxtaposition

423
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:07,600
between what Martin Hoagland calls secular faith. So this is the idea of faith in our, in our being

424
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,760
as faith in our finitude, faith in the life we share together as finite beings, you know,

425
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,880
under the, under the horizon of death or within the, you know, the limit of the horizon of death,

426
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,920
the kind of existential secular conception of ultimate concern, where ultimate concern

427
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,040
really has to be grounded in, in this life and, and this world that we, that we share with each

428
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:42,240
other. Good, good. Whereas the notion of transcendence can be used in a way that would, that would,

429
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,480
that would be juxtaposed to that where transcendence would mean something like

430
00:44:47,200 --> 00:45:02,320
a state either of liberation or freedom or release that takes us beyond or outside this life.

431
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,480
Transcendence doesn't have to be used that way because you could have a transcendence in

432
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,360
imminence again within this, you know, within this life. But when used that way, which I think is,

433
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:22,160
is one fundamental sense of transcendence we see running through lots of different religious traditions,

434
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,640
then I don't see,

435
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,520
it's not that I want to deny that because I think for many people that's important and meaningful

436
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,320
but it wouldn't be how I would articulate the sacred or ultimate concern.

437
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,800
Right. And so there's a diss, I mean, and I've realized I've made an error sometimes in making

438
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,560
this a hard and fast distinction, it's more of a continuum, but there is a distinction to be made

439
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,520
between something being indispensable to somebody and somebody claiming it's sort of metaphysically

440
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,840
necessary in some fashion. The example I use is I'm, I'm monolingual, so English is indispensable

441
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:10,080
to my cognitive agency. That doesn't mean it's metaphysically necessary. And so I think,

442
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:18,080
I think that's how I sort of parse what you're doing. And I agree with you, the sacred does not

443
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,400
obligate us to any kind of escapism because behind the escapism is a two worlds mythology

444
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,920
and then we have the problem of the bifurcation and then we're getting into back to the very place

445
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,840
we're trying to get from. And I agree with that. That's a mistake. But here's like, so for example,

446
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,640
the meaning in life literature, you want to ask people if they have meaning in life, you can

447
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,320
ask them these three questions. And like, and like, what do you want to exist even if you don't?

448
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,720
Sorry, say that question again. What do you want to exist even if you don't?

449
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,080
Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. How real is it? And sometimes you put in the qualifier,

450
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,640
how really real is it? Because what do you mean, right? And then, and then how much of a difference

451
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,600
do you make to it right now? If you got, if you got something, it doesn't have to be an object,

452
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:08,880
obviously, if you have something that, you know, this is Susan Wolf's, this is trying to, you know,

453
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,680
break out into a questionnaire Susan Wolf's idea of being connected to something larger than yourself.

454
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,880
Right. What that metaphor means is, well, people want this thing,

455
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,560
like they want it to be in the universe, even if they're not, it's not, it's not in any way

456
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:29,520
bound to their egocentric preferences. Right. Right. And then the next one is, right. It can't

457
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,480
be fraudulent. It can't be mere appearance. It can't be superficial. It has to have significance

458
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,760
in depth. And then, and then the next is, but we have to be connected to it. We have to make a

459
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,480
difference to it. And so, so remember, I agree with everything you said, and I sort of ran through

460
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:55,280
that, the argument with you about it. But how do you, I'm going to express sympathy. I can express,

461
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,160
and let me buttress this. Okay. So you're, you're in the Axial Revolution. You've got Bella's second

462
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,080
order thinking your, your metacognition has been massively improved by numeracy with what the Greeks

463
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,040
are doing with alphabetic literacy. You've got incipient democracy. So debate is everywhere,

464
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,760
hyper justification, and you've got a shared culture, but many different polices. So you have all

465
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,040
the six social experimentation, and this is really blowing your metacognitive abilities up. Right.

466
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,280
And so you're getting just a tremendous awareness of your capacities for self deception. And then

467
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,840
you're liable to think, oh, you know, and you can see this in Plato, you can, you can even see it

468
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,400
outside of Greece. You can see it like in the Dhammapada, but, you know, the right and things

469
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,840
like this, that, you know, this realization about how much of our suffering and violence is due to

470
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:49,440
this self deceptive proclivity of the mind. And then you could start to conceive of a world that,

471
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,840
how the world would be if you weren't looking at it through that torture of self deception and

472
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,600
self destruction. And then you could plug into this, this other thing we said, you've got that's,

473
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,560
it's being connected to that is deeply meaningful to you. And you somehow have a sense of it being

474
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:14,400
beyond your life, right, and beyond your egocentric concerns. And so I'm not justifying, I'm trying

475
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,280
to play with an explanation with you. It's very tempting to give into a two rules mythology,

476
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,680
that is just such a wonderful way of explaining all of that and drawing it together.

477
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,840
Yeah, no, that's right. And I think, you know, they're, they're different cultural forms

478
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:40,640
that, that that takes. So, you know, say in India, where in the, you know, the Vedas, we don't really

479
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:48,160
see the, the idea of rebirth or, or, you know, reincarnation, as we sometimes say, we, we have

480
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,120
a cosmology in which, you know, there may be, you know, higher, more divine kind of transformative

481
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:02,640
states or possibilities after death that have to do with, with divinities and, and, you know,

482
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,960
the sort of sacred order of the cosmos. And then we have this idea that we have this sort of

483
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,840
ethicization of action, where the idea is, you know, if you act, you know, in a good way, then,

484
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,320
you know, the possibility of a more refined transformative after death state is open to

485
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,240
you. If you act in a bad way, then it's going to go worse for you after death. And, and so we,

486
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,880
we have this sort of, you could say kind of two world, if we, if we slice it in terms of, you

487
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,440
know, life here and what happens after, you know, after death. And then we have the idea that

488
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,760
of karma that we see really first in the Upanishads, where it's, you know, because of desire,

489
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,400
you're actually thrown back from that other world into this world. And then it goes round and round

490
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,040
and that becomes an existential problem that has to be, you know, has to be solved. And then we get,

491
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:59,120
you know, the different solutions to it on the part of, you know, Buddhism and, and,

492
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,520
you know, the Buddhist teachings or, or what later come to be called Hindu teachings.

493
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,920
So that's all part of this axial, this axial transformation in our, in our consciousness,

494
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,280
in our metacognition, in our cosmology, in our ethics, definitely. And

495
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,040
well, let me phrase the question. Since we've landed on sort of a, I like the way you broadened

496
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,960
it, because I want the cross, cross contextual, cross historical, right? Given that something

497
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:34,000
like that, let's like, like that, how do we preserve the recognizable gains? There's a

498
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,920
change in the notion of wisdom to, to, like you said, this, this kind of liberation, maybe escape,

499
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,640
but transformation from, you know, maybe a bronze age, you know, Taylor talks about,

500
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,880
you know, the continuous cosmos and you're trying to fit in and harmonize, right? It's a,

501
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,800
it's a very, it's a very different notion of wisdom. How do we preserve what was gained

502
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,640
by us? And you know, I'm going to obviously ask the same thing when we come to the scientific

503
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:07,200
revolution. How do we, how do we preserve what was gained by the axial revolution? Well, can we,

504
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,800
can we preserve that? Let's say we, we agree we want to preserve it. I'm presuming here,

505
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,160
but let's say we want to preserve a lot of what was gained by that, all the metacognitive

506
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:19,280
enhancements, all the sense of individual responsibility, right? Etc. The realization

507
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,920
of self deception, the possibility of self correction. How do we, how do we maintain all

508
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:28,880
of that? Or can we, I'll phrase it a question, better question, can we maintain all of that? And

509
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:34,240
I don't know, tear it free. And I'm trying to use a somewhat violent metaphor from

510
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,800
the two worlds of mythology. I mean, it's, it's almost, and, and, and, you know, part of this

511
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,840
also plugs into even our, you know, our conceptual metaphors and our embodiment, real is more up,

512
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,680
less real is down. And like, I'm peeling up today and you're looking down at all this kind of language

513
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,480
and we abstract and the abstract is above and the concrete is like, like it's, it's, it's so woven

514
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,640
culturally and even like into, you know, plugs into our embodiment in a powerful way.

515
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,400
I think we can, but I want to hear what you, do you perceive the difficulty of the problem?

516
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:16,960
Oh, certainly. I mean, that is, that is a huge question. You might say a part of the big historical

517
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,760
question for our, for our times and the, and the, you know, the crisis of meaning that we

518
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,360
face as, as you've talked about it. And, and I see it, you know, it's hard not to sort of go

519
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:34,320
Hegelian here, but, but I'm going to give in to the temptation. I see it, I see it in a way as,

520
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,000
you know, that was a, that was a hugely transformative

521
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:48,480
revolution, let's call it, you know, the Axial Revolution. And we might also think that things

522
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,280
were lost in that. So we might think that a certain relationship to the natural world

523
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:03,920
was lost. And we're now especially conscious of the need to restore some viable,

524
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,240
I'll even say sustainable, though it's become a buzzword, some viable, sustainable relationship

525
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,760
between the human and the, and the rest of the biosphere that requires, I think, an affirmation

526
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,520
of the, the, the specialness of our earth environment. You know, yes, there are in, so

527
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,760
Marcelo Gleiser's book, The Dawn of a Mindful Universe is about this. It's, you know, yes,

528
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,880
there are, you know, inordinately many planets out there that might be able to support life,

529
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,520
but a critical examination also suggests that there might actually be very, very few that have

530
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,840
life. And if life is a special thing that's happened here, at least in the way that it's

531
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,480
happened here, then, you know, the sacred and ultimate concern has to involve our being in

532
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,240
relationship to the, to the biosphere. And we have to do it in a way that involves all of the

533
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:02,720
ethical cognitive gains that we made as a were of, from the Axial Revolution, you know, telescoping,

534
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,880
you know, huge historical time here. But we also have to do it in a way that recovers a kind of

535
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,560
sensibility to the, and relationship to the natural world that there would have been

536
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,080
pre-agricultural, at least according to some historical narratives. We need, we don't, we

537
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:23,680
can't go back to that, of course, that's absurd, but we need to recover something of that in a new,

538
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:30,080
so the way this is Hegelian is it's like a higher turn of the spiral. This would be how my dad would

539
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,520
have put it, actually, is that, you know, you have this course, a recourse of history, and you never

540
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,000
repeat the same thing, but there are patterns where at a certain turning of the spiral, you

541
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,640
actually can look down and see, you know, the axial turn, you know, the, the, the, the turn that

542
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:51,040
would have been or the curve that would have been before the axial. And from that perspective, you

543
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:57,360
need to, you need to recover things that were lost because there's always something lost as well

544
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,280
when you, when you have a, when you have a gain. And that, you know, the amazing thing about science,

545
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,160
just to bring it back to the book for a moment, is that, you know, with, with things like the

546
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,560
Gaia theory and earth system science, we've opened up a whole new appreciation of, you know, that we

547
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,280
don't live on the planet, we live in the planet that were embedded at so many levels in the very

548
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:26,800
fabric of life on the planet. And that is it, is it, you know, to really, to really be with that in a,

549
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:32,720
in a, in an ethical way requires a kind of profound, I think, change in our, in our sensibility,

550
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:40,800
that, that science gives us some of the tools for not all of them, but some of them. And the other

551
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:46,320
things are going to need to come from, you know, larger perspectives of ethics and the sacred,

552
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,480
you know, religion and spirituality, art. I mean, the world is a lot bigger than science,

553
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,760
right, the human cultural world. Yeah. Well, that brings up two things. One is, of course,

554
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,440
I assume you're making a similar argument about the scientific revolution that there was a lot

555
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,720
lost. I mean, that's what the book is saying. That's right. That's right. And, but you're not

556
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:16,880
proposing nostalgia. I get that. Definitely not. And so the thing you said about that, that, that met,

557
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,480
that, so it's not only a looking back through the eyes of history, it's also looking around

558
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,720
through eyes other than the eyes of science, art, ritual, all different ways of knowing,

559
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:37,360
different ways of being together, of being in the world, looking, you know, looking from within,

560
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,760
not looking at, but looking from within nature, Ursula Goodnuff's notion of transcendence into

561
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:50,560
nature, things like that. And so Whitehead had this idea that we need to recover, almost in Tolkien's

562
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:59,600
sense of recover, we need to recover art and ritual and all of this and somehow bring it back

563
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:05,680
into having a proper role within our epistemological and ontological endeavors. That's clearly

564
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,040
sort of a thing that Whitehead is arguing. Does that land for you too? Oh, definitely. Yeah.

565
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,360
Okay. Okay. And here's where we're maybe trespassing on Matt's work, Matt Seagal,

566
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,000
especially his most recent book. But you know, and this where I'm influenced somewhat by

567
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,600
Habermas, right? You know, Kant basically severs the true and the good and the beautiful from each

568
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,400
other in really powerful ways with the three critiques and the autonomy arguments for each one

569
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:38,000
of those. And you know, Kant is sort of looming in places in the book here and there. Because

570
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:44,800
you're rejecting both the kind of old Platonism and simple Kantianism about things like math.

571
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,920
We'll probably get into that in the next conversation. I don't know if we'll get to it now.

572
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,080
But I'm trying to get at what would, at least in a preliminary fashion, and I'm not trying

573
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,840
to pin you here. You know, I'm your friend. I want to talk to you about this. How would you

574
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,960
address? I mean, that's a hard problem. It's a hard problem. I mean, Habermas has been wrestling with

575
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:10,960
it. He wrestled with it, sorry, right? To, you know, overcoming those arguments that give us the

576
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,600
autonomy of the true, the good and beautiful. We have a sense, you know, and David Schindler has

577
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,560
been arguing about how they're actually convertible and all that sort of stuff. But how would you,

578
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:29,920
where would you, where would you go to, like, I'm trying to make, I'm trying to make Kant the

579
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:37,280
impediment that you have to address right now. But that's not all of his work, but just this move

580
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:47,840
about, right, the, you know, the separation and making autonomous, including making the

581
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:52,880
individual autonomous with each one of the, within each one of these autonomies of, you know, because

582
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:59,840
of the three critiques. That seems to me like a really powerful thing to be trying to wrestle with

583
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,280
philosophically. And the book has a philosophical edge to it. You represent that.

584
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,800
Yeah, that's an interesting question. I hadn't quite thought of it in those

585
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:19,760
Kantian terms. I suppose my, you know, my philosophical sensibility is so informed by

586
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,800
phenomenology in the sort of, you know, sense coming from, from, from this role. And

587
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:35,840
it doesn't, there's, there's a way of talking about truth, where it's very easy to think of

588
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:42,000
truth as different from the beautiful say. And that's because we think of truth in terms of the

589
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,280
correctness of propositions. And we have, we have an idea of correctness really, or of, or of

590
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:54,800
correspondence. But from a phenomenological perspective, that actually is a secondary sense

591
01:00:54,800 --> 01:01:04,880
of truth. And the primary sense of truth is, is disclosure, or presence, or the, to be, you

592
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,720
know, technical in the way that Husserl uses the terminology, the, you know, the evidencing

593
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:16,080
of something. So evidencing is the, you know, we use evidence as a noun in English. We think

594
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,000
here's a piece of evidence, but, but in other languages, evidencing has this verbal sense,

595
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,640
where you, you disclose something, you, you uncover it, you reveal it, it comes to presence,

596
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,120
you know, Heidegger tries to talk about this in terms of his, his sort of etymological

597
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,880
reconstruction of the, you know, the Greek sense of unconcealment of Aletheia, you know,

598
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,200
Lethe is the concealment, the alpha privative Aletheia is the unconcealment. So there's this

599
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,480
opening, this, the space of unconcealment and openness. And it's within that space that you

600
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,040
can then say, in terms of a proposition you might assert that you put in quotation marks,

601
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,720
oh, that proposition that you just said, it's correct. That happens against this other sense of

602
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,240
truth, which is, you know, unconcealment, presence, openness, evidence, disclosure, you know, however

603
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:06,560
you want to, however you want to put it. So within that context, it's very difficult to make a

604
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:16,160
separation between the, the, the, the, the, the sense of truth as unconcealment and say,

605
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:25,440
the beautiful or other aesthetic, aesthetic properties for that matter, or the just. And

606
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,760
so if we think of it that way, we are in a sense going back before Kant, you might say, well,

607
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:37,440
that's going back before the critical philosophy of Kant and, and thinking in, you know, a more

608
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,120
Greek way. That's fine. As long as we do it, having taken, you know, the knowledge and the

609
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:48,160
message, if we want to simplify things of Kant on board, you know, it's like, we're not going back

610
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,880
in some nostalgic way in the way that Heidegger often writes, in a way that I find actually

611
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,760
very distasteful, this kind of nostalgic, artificial German, German romantic sort of

612
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,320
projection back into the ancient world. No, we're not doing that. We're, we're taking what

613
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:08,480
we've learned from Kant, but we're moving forward in the way that, say, phenomenologists have taught

614
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:20,240
us to, taught us to do, where again, the, the, the, let's say, the horizon of experience as,

615
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:28,000
as, as presence is the, is the, is the context within which we're, we're going to be talking,

616
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,480
where those distinctions don't, can't, can't be made hard and fast in the way that they might

617
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,360
have been done, right, in, for, for the Kantian purposes. I want to play with that a little bit.

618
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:44,400
I like that, because I've done similar play, you know, Rikur talks about the hermeneutics of

619
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,280
suspicion and that, and I've made the argument the hermeneutics of suspicion is parasitic

620
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,800
on what I call the hermeneutics of beauty. The hermeneutics of suspicion is

621
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,560
appearances are distorting, misleading, they, they conceal deception, blah, blah. But the

622
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:04,000
hermeneutics of beauty, at least, some people are talking about beauty is, well, no, but there

623
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,240
have to be situations in which appearances disclose reality, that appearances is not a veil, right,

624
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,400
the way, that's an enlightenment ideal, but, and that beauty is when we're getting a sense,

625
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,880
and this, and, and Skari does this in her book on beauty, that it's what we're getting a sense of,

626
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,680
oh, oh, it's, and it's, it's bound up with almost like that insight moment where you realize, oh,

627
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,160
I haven't been seeing this as, as, as, as it is. And then, so that's beauty, but then that you're

628
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,800
already also in like the truth, but you're also getting into this other thing, this sort of,

629
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:37,600
and you get this research from people who have, look at the Griffith lab and others, I know you're

630
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:41,360
familiar with this research, and they have the experience, the noetic experience of the really

631
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:47,520
real, and it seems to have a kind of normativity to them, right, right, that, and it's just, it's

632
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:53,600
just in the fact that it's real, that it's normatively binding on them, like, and they,

633
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,480
they transform their lives and their relationships, and they're not guided by at least a Kantian sense

634
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,200
of being more moral, and they're not, right, but they're guided, but nevertheless, by this sense

635
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,000
of a goodness, I call it, onto normativity, just to give a name to it, somehow there's a goodness

636
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:15,280
to reality, that, and, and you're nodding, you might be just being polite, but is that

637
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,080
sort of the kind of thing you're talking about, where you start to unpack these kind of things,

638
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,800
and you start to say, well, no, you know, there's a sense of beauty as appearance is disclosing

639
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:30,080
something underneath them, which relates to truth as disclosure, and then there's a sense of goodness

640
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:36,480
as, you know, this contact with the really real as something that's sort of an ur normativity for

641
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:43,600
us. Is that? Yeah, very much so. I mean, I think, you know, in addition to beauty, I would, I would

642
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:56,000
invoke awe and wonder. Sure, of course. Yeah, yeah. I think that it's impossible to separate those

643
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,080
things phenomenologically in, in those kinds of experiences and situations that, that people

644
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,760
have, including, including science, right? Yeah, I mean, you read what, you know, you read Einstein,

645
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:16,320
you know, writing about, about the, the, the, the worldview that he has as a scientist and the,

646
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:23,520
and, and some of his own, you know, experiences in thinking about his scientific work. You read

647
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,840
historical, you know, scientific figures throughout, throughout history, and, and they all, you know,

648
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:37,040
express or many of them express this, this sense of, you know, awe and, and, and wonder and amazement

649
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:44,480
and, and, you know, a feeling of the good transformative insight. And I think there's a deep

650
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,240
connection. So I'm really going to lay my cards on the table because I know I can do that with you.

651
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,560
But I mean, for me, I, I, I'm very much

652
01:06:52,800 --> 01:07:02,000
drawn to mysticism in, as a mode of understanding what's happening there. I think of, you know,

653
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,760
science and mysticism as, as deeply linked throughout history in, in, in, in philosophical,

654
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,400
cultural and, and, you know, personality ways in terms of individual scientists where,

655
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:19,280
you know, mysticism is this, I think of mysticism almost as a kind of epistemic

656
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:28,880
humility. It's that, you know, the world is, is vast. It's unfathomable. And that there are modes of

657
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,040
knowing is not even the right word. There are modes of being in which there is a felt

658
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:42,800
oneness or unity that can be expressed in enumably different ways in, you know, in, in science,

659
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:48,480
in art, in philosophy, and, and mysticism, you know, so, so going back to the sacred,

660
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,160
I think of it as a kind of, you know, the need for kind of imminent mysticism, a mysticism of,

661
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:01,360
you know, here and now in this planet, you know, with, with, with the needs that, that face us as

662
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,240
a species and as a, as a civilization, as a scientific civilization. So I see the mystic as

663
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:13,520
really almost the, the, you know, the guardian, the reminder, the reminderer, the, the sort of

664
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,280
watch person for that sensibility. Yeah.

665
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,480
Well, I think you know that I agree with that quite deeply. A lot of my work is about trying

666
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:28,080
to get these two to speak together. And in your own book, The Blind Spot, I was noting the many

667
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,120
places where you explained why this was chosen by the scientists, especially in the history

668
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,840
chapter, because it was elegant, because it was beautiful, because it was simple. I mean, there's

669
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,560
a problem with the notion of simple. We act as if it's a cleanly, cleanly determinable thing,

670
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:47,600
but it's not right. And stuff like that. But there, yeah, there was this tremendous sense of how

671
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:56,400
much that is how that is, you know, driving, motivating and justifying the moves that these

672
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:00,640
scientists are making historically. Yeah. And even, you know, as people have written about,

673
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:08,080
just, you know, just to balance things that that can sometimes lead us astray, you know, we can get

674
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,520
caught up in the beauty of the mathematical constructions in a way where we lose, we lose

675
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,720
contact with how the world actually is talking back to us. And we, you know, we depart from

676
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:26,080
any real possibility of experiential grounding or confirmation or support. I mean, this happens.

677
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,360
You know, so I'm, you know, Marcelo and Adam could talk much more articulately about this,

678
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:36,240
but you know, this happens in, in areas of physics, you know, in string theory or, you know,

679
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,400
the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and how people just are willing to

680
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,480
run with its metaphysical implications in this sort of profligated indiscriminate way. So that's

681
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:49,920
sort of the flip side is you can get, you can get fascinated by constructions that have a kind of

682
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,760
beauty, but that are, but that are misleading in certain ways. For sure. For sure. And

683
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,920
it's interesting that maybe we'll leave to when they're present to talk about this more in depth,

684
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,160
but you can see sort of both of these impulses, right? You, yeah, you can get the rabbit holding

685
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,720
that goes on with strings theory and multiple worlds. And it's just one electron moving all

686
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:17,440
through time and space, encountering itself and like, what, how could you possibly determine that

687
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,640
or given empirical content of that claim? And then, but the other, like there, there is something,

688
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,800
and I hear that the, the, maybe I'll call, I'll be poetic, the whisper of the mystic in the,

689
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:36,400
in this drive to unify the very, very bottom with the very, very top, the cosmos,

690
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,280
relativity with quantum. And it's like, you know, if there was ever a falsification of

691
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,120
popper, there's a falsification. We've had the best minds and the best technique, and they keep

692
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:49,520
making this hypothesis and it keeps getting reliably disconfirmed and they, that doesn't matter.

693
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:56,400
They just keep going and they just keep going. And I think that's powerful. Yeah. I wouldn't

694
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:03,520
want to. I, I'm very, I, I try to make a distinction between the wisdom that mysticism

695
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,080
can give us and any particular ontological or epistemological knowledge claims that are made.

696
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:15,600
And the first, I think, I take very seriously the second, I, I agree with quite a bit of

697
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:23,840
suspicion. Right. And, and, and I think that's important. Well, I just want to, I want to wrap

698
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:31,520
up for today. And we're, we're, I think this was great. We're really unpacking things really nicely,

699
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,600
very dialogically, the way I like, I want to talk to you next time, just to forewarn.

700
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,840
I want to talk to you around, about these issues, about abstraction. And you mean,

701
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,960
you make a wonderful correction, or at least amendment cameras at the end of chapter one

702
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,680
or chapter two, you talk about, well, you say, actually, we mean more or less abstract or more

703
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:55,680
or less concrete, because the terms are actually relative and comparative, right? You know,

704
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,400
the dog is more abstract than the cocker spaniel, but the mammals more abstract than the dog and,

705
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,000
right, and all that sort of thing. And I want to unpack that a little bit more.

706
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:10,160
And how does that plug into this notion of more, more real, as you're more closer to the

707
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:14,240
inexhaustible fount of intelligibility. And then there's this other one about,

708
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,080
you know, direct experience, immediate pure experience. And, you know, and then you're

709
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,400
familiar with this, no doubt. These are criticisms made by others against people like Nishida and

710
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:28,240
the Kyoto schools, you know, and hey, Gillians would make this argument. What? What do you mean?

711
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:34,000
There's no, there's all experience is mediated. That's the gain from the Kantian Revolution.

712
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,600
That's the thing you're doing where you're trying to go back before it can't, you're giving up the

713
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,480
realization that everything is mediated in some fashion. And there's no such thing as immediate

714
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:47,200
experience or direct experience. Right. Does that sound like a fecundary to go into it?

715
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,360
Yeah, definitely. I mean, immediate, immediate is like abstract concrete. It's, you know,

716
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,560
there's, yeah, yeah, exactly. There's a contextual issue there as to what,

717
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,800
what immediate versus immediate means just as there is for abstract concrete. But yeah,

718
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,120
no, those are all important things to talk about. Definitely. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Excellent.

719
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:11,280
Well, Evan, first of all, I'm going to thank you. This has been just fantastic. Thanks.

720
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:16,080
I had great expectations and it exceeded them. I really enjoyed myself a lot. I hope you did.

721
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, definitely. Lots of fun. And I definitely want you back. Let's have the next one just be you

722
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,320
and I again. Okay. And then maybe we, you could reach out to your co-authors and we could set up

723
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:32,080
maybe a third and fourth with all of us together. Yeah. We might need a little bit more time for

724
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:38,160
those episodes just to give more space for more people to be able to chime in. But I always like

725
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:42,320
to give my, you know this from when you were on the philosophy of meditation, we'd like to give

726
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,640
the people here the last word. It can be provocative. It can be summative. It can be

727
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,960
mysteriously evocative. Whatever you want it to be. I don't know if I have a, if I have a last word

728
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,840
of that, of that nature, other than just to say it's always lots of fun to talk with you. And,

729
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,000
and yeah, you know, I've really enjoyed the conversation. Yeah.

730
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,120
All right. So then I'll give the last word. I'm going to plug the book again. Okay. Really.

731
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:13,680
This book, if you are interested in the meeting crisis, if you're interested in, well,

732
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:18,400
relevance realization, that's in the book too. If you're interested in all of these issues,

733
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:24,000
we'll be talking about the sacred, about, you know, the fact that somehow we need to be put back

734
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,720
into the scientific worldview, but that means changing what we mean by a scientific worldview.

735
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,480
And you should be interested if you're watching this video, because I've been talking about those

736
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:37,600
things for five years, at least in this space, and I don't know, 20 years at the university. So

737
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:45,200
you should definitely buy the book. Again, very clearly written, accessible without being a dumbing

738
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,520
down. It's a nice stepping down without being a dumbing down. I highly recommend the book.

739
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,240
Go out and get it. It's not expensive. It's a great read. And thank you very much again, Evan.

740
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,240
Just great pleasure. Thank you.
