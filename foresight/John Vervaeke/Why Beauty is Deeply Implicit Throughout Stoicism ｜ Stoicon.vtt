00:21.760 --> 00:25.040
Thank you, Catherine. That was probably the best introduction I've ever received.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.960
I assure you, I'm very happy to be here and I'm very engaged with the material I'll be

00:30.960 --> 00:39.920
presenting to you. Okay, so let's start. Why is, why beauty is deeply implicit in stoicism,

00:39.920 --> 00:46.960
especially in its commitment to rationality and virtue? So, Han, in his book, Saving Beauty,

00:46.960 --> 00:52.160
laments that we have reduced the beautiful to the smooth. This is what he calls it.

00:52.800 --> 01:00.560
This is the pleasantly, easily accessible and useful. So, the way my phone is smooth. The way

01:00.560 --> 01:08.800
many things are now smooth. And this is convergent with his work in another book, Agony, the Agony

01:08.800 --> 01:15.360
of Eros, about how intimacy with mystery, which used to be in our erotic relationship,

01:15.840 --> 01:22.880
and this intimacy with mystery, which demands transformation and commitment from us,

01:23.600 --> 01:31.680
has been replaced by pornography that gives priority to easy access and use for pleasure.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.280
So, this is the idea of the reduction of the beautiful as something that was initially

01:38.160 --> 01:47.360
very transformative and very demanding upon us to something that in fact puts very little demand

01:47.360 --> 01:55.760
on us whatsoever. Now, he's no doubt correct how this reflects a consumerist greed in our culture

01:55.760 --> 02:02.000
and a culture oriented to quick and easy gratification, to bottom line mentality, etc.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.480
And his argument, of course, is convergent with the argument of other people, just one among

02:06.480 --> 02:14.880
many examples, arguments from current musicologists about the loss of complex melody in popular music

02:14.880 --> 02:21.840
in favor of super salient, please remember that notion, super salient beat and repetition. So,

02:21.840 --> 02:28.400
again, we have easy access and of course, easy access makes sense when we are doing mass marketing

02:28.400 --> 02:35.520
within a mass society. I think all of this is completely coherent argument. However, I believe

02:35.520 --> 02:41.040
that there is something more going on in this reduction of beauty to ease of access to pleasure

02:41.040 --> 02:47.760
and use. I think something else is going on. I propose that there is a deep suspicion about

02:47.760 --> 02:55.120
appearance in our culture. There is a suspicion that appearances are misleading, distorting,

02:55.760 --> 03:03.840
distracting, untrustworthy, and often being used for manipulation nefarious manipulation.

03:03.840 --> 03:11.680
In my work with Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic in 2019 in a book entitled Zombies

03:11.680 --> 03:17.600
in Western Culture, A 21st Century Crisis, in which we explained the emergence of the zombie

03:17.600 --> 03:24.640
mythology as a way of articulating the meaning crisis, we noted the upsurge in the increasing

03:24.640 --> 03:29.200
prevalence and power of bullshit. People are convinced there's more and more bullshit,

03:29.200 --> 03:34.960
and it is more and more powerful in our society. Now, the notion of bullshit I'm using, I'm not

03:34.960 --> 03:42.800
trying to be vulgar. I'm making explicit use of Frankfurt's technical arguments about bullshit in

03:42.800 --> 03:50.480
his seminal essay on bullshit. So, Frankfurt distinguishes the liar from the bullshit artist.

03:50.480 --> 03:56.400
The liar tries to manipulate your behavior by depending on your concern for the truth

03:56.400 --> 04:01.920
and getting you to believe something to be true that is not true. That is the liar. The liar is

04:01.920 --> 04:08.560
depending on your caring commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist, on the other hand, is trying

04:08.560 --> 04:15.840
to get you indifferent to whether or not some claim is true and rather to be caught up in the salience

04:15.840 --> 04:20.880
of the claim. So, prototypical examples of this, of course, are an advertising in which,

04:21.600 --> 04:26.480
you know, you see the commercial and there's a beautiful person

04:27.840 --> 04:33.600
in a bar and they're surrounded by other beautiful people. And notice my invocation of that. We'll

04:33.600 --> 04:39.440
come back to that. And there's an alcohol present and they're all very happy and very healthy.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.160
And you know this isn't true. You know that this is not what you're going to see if you go into a

04:44.160 --> 04:48.240
bar. This isn't what you know this is not going to happen to you when you start drinking the alcohol.

04:48.240 --> 04:54.960
And they know that you know that none of this is true. And this is the important point. It doesn't

04:54.960 --> 05:00.720
matter because it puts you into a state where you don't care whether or not it's true and you just

05:00.720 --> 05:07.840
find the stimulus of the alcohol super salient. And therefore, you are much more likely to buy

05:07.840 --> 05:13.520
the alcohol, which of course is why so much money is poured into advertising. So, advertising is

05:13.520 --> 05:20.000
prototypical bullshit. It works by getting you to not care about the truth at least some of the time

05:20.640 --> 05:26.000
and who instead be caught up in the salience of what is being presented to you. Now, what's

05:26.000 --> 05:30.800
interesting about this is the deep connection between bullshitting and self deception and how

05:30.800 --> 05:36.640
they mutually reinforce each other. You see, although we use the metaphor, you cannot really

05:36.640 --> 05:42.320
lie to yourself. You cannot say to yourself, I believe X, but I want to believe Y because

05:42.320 --> 05:47.840
belief is not a direct voluntary action. Belief is not something you do. Pick a belief you'd like

05:47.840 --> 05:54.240
to have that everybody loves you. Okay, do it. Believe it. Go. There's nothing to be done. You

05:54.240 --> 05:58.000
can imagine it. You can hope for it. You can desire it. You can't believe it. That's not how

05:58.000 --> 06:03.680
belief works, but you can bullshit yourself because salience is actually affected by your

06:03.680 --> 06:08.800
attention. If I say your left big toe, it is now a salient to you. And of course, when things are

06:08.800 --> 06:15.680
salient, now they will tend to attract your attention in the future. And so by paying attention to

06:15.680 --> 06:20.080
things, you make them more salient, which is more likely to grab your attention. And so you get a

06:20.080 --> 06:26.000
self reinforcing cycle until you are drawn into particular patterns of behavior. So self deception

06:26.880 --> 06:32.880
drives, sorry, bullshit drives self deception. But of course, the more self deceived we are,

06:32.880 --> 06:37.920
the more easy it is to bullshit us because the more easy it is to get us to be unconcerned

06:37.920 --> 06:43.120
with the truth, because that of course is one of the deleterious functions of falling prey to

06:43.120 --> 06:49.200
self deception, we get disconnected from a proper pursuit of the truth. So we got this culture and

06:49.200 --> 06:55.520
with self deception and bullshit are reinforcing each other and becoming more prevalent. Now,

06:55.520 --> 07:01.520
Paul record has argued or talked about what he calls a hermetic of suspicion. And this was given to

07:01.600 --> 07:10.800
us by Freud and Nietzsche and Marx as prototypical thinkers of this ilk. And for all of these

07:10.800 --> 07:18.320
thinkers, we are they give us arguments to the effect that appearances mask self deception,

07:18.320 --> 07:25.120
they mask a hidden motive, a secret agenda, or a deceptive covert manipulation.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.600
That's why it's a hermetic suspicion, we're suspicious of how things are appearing to us.

07:33.040 --> 07:38.720
However, I would argue that it goes back to the combination of the Copernican revolution

07:38.720 --> 07:44.960
and the Protestant Reformation. So before the Copernican revolution, we have the Aristotelian

07:44.960 --> 07:51.600
notion of realness. And it's basically tested through three, through rule through three rules,

07:52.400 --> 08:01.920
right? And it's is my organ functioning properly? Is the medium clear? Do other people after

08:01.920 --> 08:06.720
reflective discussion agree with me? Now, we still live by this, by the way, we still use this to

08:06.720 --> 08:14.560
determine if what we're seeing is real. Now, this is at the hallmark core of the Aristotelian framework,

08:14.560 --> 08:21.280
but notice what happens with Copernicus, we all have well functioning eyesight. It's a clear day.

08:21.680 --> 08:27.280
We see the sun rise in the east, pass overhead, and set in the west. We all talk, we all agree

08:27.280 --> 08:34.720
that that's what we saw. And we're all wrong. We have to remember how terrifying that is.

08:35.840 --> 08:42.080
We've gotten so used to it, we, and that it has, it is so inseminated itself into us at an almost

08:42.080 --> 08:48.400
unconscious level. But it expresses itself in a deep suspicion. Because if that's, if that,

08:48.480 --> 08:54.720
if that can fail the test, what else is failing the test? What else is passing all of our intuitive

08:54.720 --> 09:01.920
judgments about what is real? And nevertheless, turn out to be illusions. The Protestant Reformation,

09:01.920 --> 09:09.200
of course, taught us that we cannot trust traditional institutions. We cannot trust their

09:09.200 --> 09:15.840
sense of right and wrong. We are thrown back upon, ultimately, individual conscience. Now,

09:15.840 --> 09:20.800
that may not have been Luther's original intent, but that's not relevant to my argument right now.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.280
What we end up with is we get the isolated individual trapped behind

09:26.240 --> 09:31.600
sense experience, where that sense experience is understood as the veil of appearance. I was taught

09:31.600 --> 09:37.920
this repeatedly in my undergrad in philosophy as a central issue with which we had to contend,

09:37.920 --> 09:49.440
the veil of appearance, and an ongoing anxiety about skepticism and solipsism at the heart of

09:49.440 --> 09:56.640
what we were trying to do. And of course, the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation

09:56.640 --> 10:02.960
and this concern with skepticism and solipsism come to a particular fruition in Kant and the

10:03.040 --> 10:09.440
tremendous impact, and he called it his Copernican Revolution, he had on the intellectual

10:09.440 --> 10:14.560
and spiritual development of what we now call, probably inaccurately, the West.

10:16.160 --> 10:22.400
In all of this, appearances became unmoored from reality and from social structure.

10:22.400 --> 10:32.000
But of course, they are still, nevertheless, salient and compelling.

10:34.400 --> 10:41.120
That is part of our inevitable embodied experience. So notice what we have here,

10:41.120 --> 10:47.440
we have appearances that are unmoored from reality and social structure. We are deeply

10:47.440 --> 10:53.520
suspicious of them, yet we find them still salient and compelling. This is super bullshit.

10:54.160 --> 11:02.480
The culture as a whole is in a place where the appearances are disconnected from realness,

11:02.480 --> 11:05.760
yet they are still compelling and driving our behavior.

11:10.160 --> 11:16.640
Now in order to protect ourselves, I propose or I'm arguing, from this we seek to tame and control

11:16.720 --> 11:24.800
appearances and make ourselves invulnerable to them being used to manipulate us. This is

11:24.800 --> 11:30.000
the great question, of course, it has been put on methamphetamines by the advent of social media.

11:32.480 --> 11:37.760
How would we tame appearances, make them easily accessible back to the smooth

11:37.840 --> 11:45.360
and and make it so they do not claim or intend to claim or pretend to claim to

11:45.360 --> 11:51.760
pretend a deeper reality. They are superficial and they glory in being superficial, the smooth.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.320
How do we seek to control them? Instead of being controlled by these appearances,

11:58.320 --> 12:06.480
they will be completely manipulated by us. They will be completely in control of us.

12:06.480 --> 12:16.960
They are solely for our use, back to the smooth. Of course, and this was what reflection and research

12:16.960 --> 12:23.520
show, this is ultimate bullshit in our attempt to not fall prey to bullshit.

12:25.600 --> 12:32.320
We actually fall deeper in it because this strategy of the smooth, the smoothing of appearances

12:32.880 --> 12:41.200
distracts us from the fact that the reduction of beauty to the smooth is precisely in service

12:41.840 --> 12:48.880
of mass marketing manipulation, as we all wear our logos that look the same,

12:50.000 --> 12:58.080
saying how individual and unique we really are. So we have super bullshit being responded to

12:58.080 --> 13:07.040
by ultimate bullshit. This, of course, is a very difficult and problematic situation.

13:08.320 --> 13:14.080
What this argument is intended to show is that the reduction of beauty carries with it

13:14.080 --> 13:20.240
considerable epistemological and ethical loss and risk.

13:20.400 --> 13:30.800
But we're not trapped in the hermeneutics of suspicion. This is a point developed by Marlowe

13:30.800 --> 13:38.160
Ponty extensively through his writings, but it ultimately goes back to a deep discussion

13:39.120 --> 13:48.240
by Plato that appears in many of his dialogues. But I'll use Marlowe Ponty's presentation of

13:48.240 --> 13:58.400
it because it is clear and accessible. Illusion is a comparative concept. It's like tall or small.

13:59.040 --> 14:05.040
It's dependent on the experience, the realization of reality. I can only say this is an illusion

14:05.040 --> 14:12.720
if I can say because it is not this which is real. It is a contrastive comparison. In fact,

14:12.800 --> 14:18.240
technically it makes no sense to say all is illusion. That's like saying everything is tall.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.480
It doesn't make any sense. Typically what people mean is all of sense experience is

14:24.480 --> 14:31.520
illusion in comparison to some X that is taken to be the reality. But there's always a comparison.

14:32.720 --> 14:39.920
So illusion is when appearances mislead us away from reality and they are dependent.

14:40.480 --> 14:48.960
Illusions are dependent upon when appearances lead to reality within acts of realization.

14:49.680 --> 14:55.120
And I want you to hear both meanings of that word coming into an intelligible understanding

14:55.120 --> 14:59.040
and awareness and becoming real, disclosed as real.

15:02.320 --> 15:07.520
Now this is one of Plato's central proposals given this realization.

15:08.240 --> 15:17.760
Beauty is when appearances disclose reality. That is beauty proper. We can realize in both

15:17.760 --> 15:29.280
senses of the word, the world through beauty. Because beauty is when appearances lead to

15:29.760 --> 15:39.040
reality and lead us to reality. And they have to be primary. They have to be more real than illusions.

15:41.760 --> 15:50.000
Now note here, this requires us giving up a lot of the subjectivist and smooth notion of beauty

15:50.000 --> 15:57.840
that we have been given in a post-continent mass marketing world. Beauty does not have to be pleasant.

15:59.920 --> 16:06.640
It can be striking or haunting. Platinus repeatedly makes reference to this possibility.

16:07.280 --> 16:15.040
Rilke in some of his great poetry talks about how beauty is terror that could kill us, but deans not to.

16:20.560 --> 16:28.160
But it is always a moment of insight, seeing in to things, seeing through illusion and in

16:28.160 --> 16:37.040
to reality. And this of course is part of what Platinus conveys in his argument is about beauty

16:37.040 --> 16:45.200
and intellectual beauty, the two ineod's. There is a moment when you realize that what appeared

16:46.960 --> 16:54.080
as relevantly real, the moment of insight, you thought something was relevantly real

16:55.040 --> 17:02.080
and then you go, aha! What was salient to me was actually misleading.

17:04.080 --> 17:10.320
It was wrong and notice the normativity in here. I thought I was apprehending her as

17:11.120 --> 17:17.840
angry, but she's actually, notice the language, she's actually afraid and therefore I should

17:18.160 --> 17:23.760
adjust how I'm apprehending her and interacting with her.

17:27.680 --> 17:34.160
Notice this realization has a normativity in it, a call to responsibility and action.

17:36.400 --> 17:42.160
The aha moment carries with it a flash of salience as one sees into reality. There's a

17:42.160 --> 17:45.920
lot of cognitive science around this and I won't go into it. You can look at my published work

17:45.920 --> 17:48.240
and my work in my on my published videos.

17:51.120 --> 17:57.760
Somehow one is more right. In fact, we find insights so compelling in this way. We tend to be

17:57.760 --> 18:03.760
biased. We tend to judge reality in terms of whether or not they were produced in our judgments,

18:03.760 --> 18:11.680
were produced in an insightful manner. When sees into reality, one is more right in both

18:11.680 --> 18:19.920
an epistemological and an ethical sense about reality. One is correct and in right relationship.

18:22.320 --> 18:31.440
We need to be very careful here. Beauty is in the act of realization. What may be disclosed

18:31.440 --> 18:39.040
could be great evil. One of my favorite paintings, and I don't use slides so I'm not going to put

18:39.040 --> 18:44.240
up a slide. I hope you've seen it. If you haven't, you could look at it later, is Picasso's Guernica,

18:45.280 --> 18:52.560
which is a painting of the bombing by the fascists of a town in Spain during the Spanish Civil

18:52.560 --> 18:58.720
War, I believe in 1937. It is in many ways a horrifying painting.

19:01.200 --> 19:06.160
Now Picasso's Guernica is trying to cut through all the proper and bullshit

19:06.160 --> 19:12.240
around war and bring us into a full presence of the full presence of the event.

19:13.920 --> 19:19.680
Collingwood would talk about this in the work of art, how it takes us out of a categorical way

19:19.680 --> 19:27.680
of thinking. This is one battle among, no, the actual suchness of this event coming to full presence

19:27.680 --> 19:35.600
of its full presencing. There's a reciprocal opening. The whole of the self is involved in

19:35.600 --> 19:40.720
opening up to a deeper and deeper apprehension of the reality. And there's a reciprocal opening,

19:41.360 --> 19:44.720
which of course is an instance of Platonic anegarge.

19:49.120 --> 19:59.120
What I'm saying is it is a beautiful disclosure of evil. But this should not be confused with saying

19:59.200 --> 20:05.520
it portrays evil as beautiful. It portrays evil as evil beautifully.

20:09.040 --> 20:14.560
We love the painting. We love the painting. We treat it. We don't destroy. Look,

20:14.560 --> 20:20.720
it's evil before us. Destroy it. It's evil. We don't destroy the painting. We honor it. We

20:20.720 --> 20:26.960
hold it sacred. I believe it's now being hung in the United Nations. It's a sacred object.

20:27.200 --> 20:32.800
We love the painting. And in that, therefore, in some important way, it is beautiful. The act of

20:32.800 --> 20:45.040
viewing it is beautiful. Not pleasing, but beautiful. Plato's second great proposal about beauty is that

20:45.040 --> 20:54.960
beauty can not must connect us to reality in a way that helps educate us in wisdom and virtue.

20:56.960 --> 21:04.240
Beauty affords self-transcendence, anegarge, as I mentioned earlier. This is echoed in the work

21:04.240 --> 21:09.200
of my friend D.C. Schindler, especially in the Catholicity of Reason and Love in the Postmodern

21:09.200 --> 21:13.120
Predicament, where he talks about the three transcendentals. And remember, they're all

21:13.120 --> 21:16.880
convertible. They're not identical, but they all interdefine and interpenetrate each other.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.760
The primacy of beauty, the centrality of goodness, and the ultimacy of truth.

21:22.560 --> 21:29.840
The primacy of beauty. Beauty is how the otherwise abstract reality of the Eidos, which is often

21:29.840 --> 21:39.920
translated as the form, the forms in Plato, first reaches into sense experience. But how? Well,

21:39.920 --> 21:49.360
Eidos actually means the look or aspect of something. Remember that. Now, think about when I ask you,

21:49.360 --> 21:56.240
what is a bird? Well, it's feathers. It has wings, beak, and it flies. So I'll pile a bunch of feathers

21:56.240 --> 22:00.800
here, put a beak, some wings, and I'll toss them in the air. They're flying. That's a bird, right?

22:00.800 --> 22:06.960
No, it's a horrific mess. Because what's missing is the structural functional organization

22:06.960 --> 22:15.040
that makes it into a bird. It's Logos, a notion that Plotinus will use that he properly gets

22:15.040 --> 22:23.680
from the Stoics, as Kevin Corrigan has argued, the Logos, this Eidos. But notice it's a way of

22:24.400 --> 22:30.320
looking at it, but the seeing isn't visual seeing, at least primarily.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.560
Because you have to understand that this structural functional organization is not

22:36.560 --> 22:42.640
just the synchronic structural functional organization, it is diachronic. Look, you actually

22:42.640 --> 22:51.760
don't ever fully see an object. You can't fully see it. And all of these different aspects,

22:51.760 --> 22:56.800
all of these different looks are held together by something that is not any aspect at all,

22:56.800 --> 23:02.560
but a through line, a through line that is one with, but not conceptually identical to,

23:02.560 --> 23:10.320
that structural functional organization. That's what the Eidos of something is. And beauty is

23:10.320 --> 23:17.120
when the Eidos is being disclosed in our awareness of something. Now, Roussin, in his

23:18.000 --> 23:22.240
really important book, Bearing Witness to Epiphany, is trying to integrate phenomenology

23:22.240 --> 23:27.440
and Plato back together. And he talks about the musicality of intelligibility. He talks

23:27.440 --> 23:32.880
about the fact that when we're making sense of things, there's a rhythm that we need to pick up on.

23:33.680 --> 23:38.880
There's a rhythm, right? There's a rhythm going through this. And there's a melody. All of the

23:38.960 --> 23:42.560
different instances are like notes. They're not identical, but they all belong together.

23:42.560 --> 23:48.000
And there's a harmony. There's an organizing, unifying principle to it. This is the musicality

23:48.640 --> 23:55.760
of intelligibility. And intelligibility is our primary way of determining what realness is. So

23:55.760 --> 24:02.320
realness and intelligibility and musicality are bound up together.

24:02.400 --> 24:12.800
When we have an insight into the form, we're leaping into a Gestalt. Not just the

24:12.800 --> 24:18.480
synchronic Gestalt that's in our mind, but the diachronic Gestalt through the musicality

24:19.120 --> 24:26.080
of intelligibility, of our experience of a thing. This leaping into the Gestalt is what

24:26.080 --> 24:40.240
Zewicki talks about in the experience of meaning. So notice what we're saying here. Stoic notions

24:40.240 --> 24:46.160
of beauty are often, and I don't know her name, and I wasn't here for her earlier talk because,

24:46.160 --> 24:52.000
as I said, I'm not feeling well. I don't know if it's Salkite or Kalkite. I apologize for any

24:52.640 --> 25:02.080
pronunciation. Makes a good case for Stoic beauty as Sumitria. Not exactly the same as our notion,

25:02.080 --> 25:06.240
current notions of symmetry, better understood as proper proportioning.

25:07.600 --> 25:14.720
Another notion is Ratio, which is at the heart of our word rationality, because rationality is

25:14.720 --> 25:21.040
the putting of things into proper proportion, properly proportioning our attention and care.

25:21.120 --> 25:31.360
And by doing this, we cut through illusion and into reality when we properly proportion our

25:31.360 --> 25:41.600
attention and care so that we can track the through line, follow the Eidos, then we cut through

25:41.600 --> 25:47.040
any possible illusion and appearances in the musicality of intelligibility,

25:47.760 --> 25:57.440
beautifully disclose an underlying reality. This is why Crecipius can say only the beautiful is good.

26:03.040 --> 26:11.280
Connecting to the real rational order of reality. This is onto normativity, a term I've coined for

26:11.280 --> 26:17.840
the fact that people find the really real, inherently good and they will transform their

26:17.840 --> 26:26.160
lives, their relationships, even their identity to be in closer communion and conformity to that

26:26.160 --> 26:32.960
really real. And of course, this lines up with the Stoic proposal that the universe itself

26:32.960 --> 26:41.120
has a logos and that logos is sacred and divine. And we are to come into an ongoing,

26:41.680 --> 26:51.760
dare I say it, musical, joyful flowing with that logos. Marcus Aurelius, of course, is aware of

26:51.760 --> 26:58.640
appearances disclosing reality and their relation to beauty. He says, we should remark the grace

26:58.640 --> 27:03.360
and fascination that there is even in the incidentals of nature's process when a loaf of bread,

27:03.360 --> 27:08.160
for instance, is in the oven. I know there's been another talk on this crack appear in it here

27:08.160 --> 27:13.680
and there and these flaws, though not intended in the baking, have a rightness of their own

27:14.320 --> 27:23.040
and sharpen the appetite. The cracks, flaws, breaking in a simple notion of symmetry,

27:23.040 --> 27:29.600
and their unintended breaks in the surface structure, have a rightness about them.

27:30.800 --> 27:35.360
Notice that language, the rightness, I've been talking about this all the way through,

27:36.000 --> 27:41.760
a rightness that sharpens the appetite. Isn't that of course what beauty does?

27:43.680 --> 27:48.880
The appearance of the cracks literally opens up the surface of the bread to the depths.

27:49.120 --> 27:55.120
And this enhances our desire to come into contact with the bread.

27:58.480 --> 28:04.960
Part two, sorry, quote two. An angry look on the face is wholly against nature.

28:05.680 --> 28:11.040
If it be assumed frequently, beauty begins to perish and in the end is quenched beyond

28:11.600 --> 28:19.760
rekindling. Why is an angry face against nature? Because it is a face that discloses passion

28:20.320 --> 28:27.840
and not the logos that is essential to our humanity. A face too often angry can lose its beauty.

28:29.440 --> 28:35.520
It no longer rightly discloses the core reality of human nature.

28:36.160 --> 28:44.960
But let's examine more closely this realization through beauty that I have been arguing for.

28:51.520 --> 28:58.080
Scarry, in an important book, an amazing book, I would put it on beauty and being just,

28:58.720 --> 29:02.800
talks about how the experience of beauty prepares us for seeking truth and justice.

29:03.680 --> 29:10.000
She gives an example of seeing a beautiful tree and she goes through the phenomenology very carefully

29:10.000 --> 29:14.640
and she says, the inside is something like, I didn't realize trees could be like that.

29:15.840 --> 29:22.480
Now, I'm going to do something, if you'll allow me to use a self-referential adjective,

29:22.480 --> 29:27.760
verbakian about this. I'm going to put this into cognitive terms of sense making.

29:28.720 --> 29:34.560
So, I didn't realize trees could be that. So, we have all of our previous experiences of trees,

29:34.560 --> 29:39.280
all the different instances, all the categories and they're converging on this new entity.

29:40.720 --> 29:47.280
And it somehow is disclosing the Eidos, the underlying reality of what trees really are.

29:47.280 --> 29:53.200
I didn't realize trees could be like it's realized. And what that does is that opens up

29:53.280 --> 29:59.200
possibilities for us, new ways of seeing and relating to trees in the future. So,

29:59.200 --> 30:08.720
notice these movements. You've got a convergence to a realization of form of Eidos that is,

30:08.720 --> 30:17.920
right, can be used in many different, it can find and formulate and reformulate problems

30:18.640 --> 30:25.760
as we encounter trees in the future. Now, if you take a look at the work on

30:25.760 --> 30:32.000
making sense and explanation, there's a couple things that come and the work on plausibility,

30:32.000 --> 30:38.720
a couple things come out. This notion of convergence, we like convergence of independent things.

30:38.720 --> 30:49.520
Or why? Well, if my realization comes through just one, let's do sense experience,

30:49.520 --> 30:54.400
comes through just one sense channel, I see something, but I can't touch it or hear it

30:54.400 --> 30:58.080
or feel it. It might not be real, it might just be a subjective illusion.

30:59.440 --> 31:05.920
But if I can see it, touch it, hear it. In fact, the more senses I can get,

31:06.640 --> 31:11.680
the more I'm convinced it's real. Why? Now, this is not an algorithm, it can go wrong,

31:11.680 --> 31:20.320
but why? Because the more convergence I have, the less likely it is, the less probable it is

31:20.880 --> 31:26.400
that my realization has been produced by subjective illusion or bias. So,

31:26.400 --> 31:33.760
convergence gives us what Rescher, in his 1976 book, plausible reasoning, calls

31:33.760 --> 31:39.200
trustworthiness. The opposite of bullshit gives us trustworthiness.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.400
Of course, we know why we want IDOS, we've already talked about that.

31:45.520 --> 31:51.280
What is it when a realization can suddenly be applied to what were previously many disparate

31:51.280 --> 31:56.880
domains? This is making use of the philosopher of science, Kicher, some of his work on stringency,

31:56.880 --> 32:01.280
but I will argue, in fact, I'll just have to claim I've got arguments elsewhere. This is what we

32:01.280 --> 32:09.120
mean when we say a scientific claim is elegant. I've had an insight that can go to many otherwise

32:09.120 --> 32:14.640
diverse. Four sequels mass times acceleration can be used to talk about planets, balloons,

32:14.640 --> 32:27.200
blue whales, accelerating cars. Wow, that's elegant. Ben Milgram in his astonishing book on

32:27.200 --> 32:33.760
practical induction, how we acquire new desires, not new beliefs, but new desires, argues for a

32:33.760 --> 32:41.440
balance between our backward and forward commitments. What does that mean? If I'm going to promise a lot

32:41.440 --> 32:50.880
of elegant problem solving going forward, I need to have a lot of convergence to my realization

32:50.880 --> 32:58.000
or claim. If I have a lot of promise without much convergence, I get the conspiracy theory,

32:58.000 --> 33:03.440
the far-fetched claim. If you only believe that the British royalty are lizard people,

33:03.440 --> 33:09.440
look at everything that I can explain. What's the opposite? We have lots of trustworthy

33:09.440 --> 33:15.440
convergence, but no elegance, no power. That's triviality. Trivialities are not false.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.160
They are not worthy of your attention. So notice what we have in plausibility,

33:22.160 --> 33:29.280
in good sense-making. Notice all the aesthetic terms, terms deeply associated with beauty.

33:29.280 --> 33:35.840
We have convergence, a coming into oneness. We have the emergence or the emanation of

33:35.920 --> 33:40.480
idos or form. We have elegance and we have balance between them.

33:44.720 --> 33:51.440
Plausibility is the beauty of good sense-making, and we are deeply attracted and moved by it.

33:51.440 --> 33:58.400
Now plausibility isn't probability and it isn't certainty. Plausibility is what you should take

33:58.400 --> 34:04.320
seriously. What is a good proposal, where you should look for the truth?

34:07.680 --> 34:15.600
Turning it around, beauty is sensory motor, plausibility that can be taken up into cognitive

34:16.720 --> 34:19.440
plausible, therefore beautiful sense-making.

34:20.000 --> 34:27.840
So, plausibility, what you should take seriously, what you should care about,

34:28.720 --> 34:36.080
the reasonable promise that salience is tracking reality, the opposite of bullshit. And of course,

34:36.080 --> 34:42.000
Socrates famously argued for a rationality of care. He knew ta erotica. He knew what to care

34:42.000 --> 34:48.160
about. He knew what he didn't need. He knew what mattered. The unexamined life is not worth living.

34:48.160 --> 34:51.760
And of course, this lines up with other more recent work by Frankfurt,

34:51.760 --> 34:57.600
the importance of what we care about and reasons for love. And my extensive, sorry,

34:57.600 --> 35:03.120
I don't mean to be self-promotional. I just want to indicate trustworthiness, work on relevance

35:03.120 --> 35:08.960
realization. You are different from computers because computers don't care about the information

35:08.960 --> 35:15.360
they process. You care about some information rather than other information and therefore you

35:15.360 --> 35:20.560
take care of it because this is all part of you taking care of yourself and other people.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.800
Lipton makes a very strong case in his book on inference to the best explanation for

35:28.800 --> 35:35.600
the primacy, the primacy of plausibility. What do I mean by that? Well, think about an experiment.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.880
I have to come up with a hypothesis. Do I generate all possible, logically possible

35:40.880 --> 35:47.840
hypotheses? No, that is combinatorially vast. I pick ones that are plausible.

35:48.480 --> 35:53.600
When I'm designing my experiment, I have to worry about confounds, possible alternative

35:53.600 --> 36:01.600
explanations. All the logically possible alternative explanations? No, that is uncountably large,

36:01.600 --> 36:07.840
only plausible alternative explanations. What implications do I draw from my data?

36:07.840 --> 36:15.040
All logically possible implications? No, those that are plausible. Plausibility is primary.

36:16.160 --> 36:23.280
It is before, during, and after all scientific investigation and labor.

36:26.480 --> 36:34.960
Rationality depends on the orienting beauty of plausibility. Plausibility is good sense making,

36:34.960 --> 36:42.160
grasping the significance of information well, grasping the, the significant of information

36:42.160 --> 36:48.560
well, caring about the information in the right way. And that's what we actually mean by understanding.

36:48.560 --> 36:54.560
Look, knowledge is about evidence. Understanding is about the relevance and significance about what

36:54.560 --> 37:01.040
you know. Plausibility and understanding are mutually defining. Here's the connection. Good

37:01.040 --> 37:07.040
sense making is the beauty of plausibility. That produces understanding. That gives us the

37:07.040 --> 37:14.000
musicality of intelligibility, which of course affords good sense making. That is the cycle

37:14.000 --> 37:19.280
that we are constantly running through. It's all a cycle of beauty.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.960
Marcus Aurelius, dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars and see yourself running with them.

37:31.920 --> 37:38.800
Dwell. This language is not the language of just belief. It is to be with

37:40.240 --> 37:46.640
and to run with. This is participating in the beauty in the very way in which you are

37:46.640 --> 37:55.520
contemplating the highest or deepest realities. Beauty is primary because it reaches into our

37:55.600 --> 38:04.720
sense life and our sense making and prepares us for truth and affords us seeking it.

38:07.760 --> 38:12.080
In this way, beauty, and I've already alluded to this, beauty is anti-bullshit.

38:16.320 --> 38:21.360
Beauty helps us discern through bullshit and tutor us how to care well.

38:21.680 --> 38:25.440
What to take seriously? What matters?

38:27.360 --> 38:32.880
McGee and Barber in 1999, this ability to see through illusion into what's real is the hallmark

38:32.880 --> 38:39.120
of wisdom. This was taken up in the consensus paper that I was a co-author on with many other

38:39.120 --> 38:44.320
people led by Igor Grossman in 2020. The science of wisdom in a polarized world, no one's an

38:44.320 --> 38:50.000
unknown. This ability to see through illusion into reality is central to wisdom.

38:52.320 --> 39:01.680
I propose to you that virtue requires discernment knowing what to take seriously and what to care

39:01.680 --> 39:06.640
about with insight and deep understanding. And when we have that, we have wisdom.

39:07.440 --> 39:17.520
In the symposium, Plato proposes that virtue is a higher order of beauty. We first notice the

39:17.520 --> 39:23.760
beauty of the beautiful person, then we moved to beautiful institutions, then to the beauty of

39:23.760 --> 39:33.840
virtue. How is virtue beautiful? Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.

39:34.800 --> 39:38.800
There are multiple competing interpretations of the Socratic

39:39.360 --> 39:43.680
proposal of the unity of the virtues, but I take this one to be the most plausible.

39:43.680 --> 39:47.520
Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.

39:50.400 --> 39:55.040
It is like to be wise in this situation is to be courageous, to be wise in this situation is to

39:55.120 --> 40:04.880
be compassionate. The virtue is a proper proportioning, a ratio of attention and care,

40:04.880 --> 40:09.680
the rationality of attention and care, so that one homes in on what is most

40:09.680 --> 40:17.040
relevantly real in that situation. Think about the stoic emphasis on posage and prochiron.

40:17.040 --> 40:22.400
It's all about tailoring us so we can do this, tutoring us and tailoring us.

40:23.120 --> 40:31.920
Each virtue is how wisdom proportionally and properly therefore appears in a particular

40:31.920 --> 40:42.160
context. Virtue is the beautiful appearance of wisdom. Virtue is how wisdom proportionally

40:42.160 --> 40:49.440
appears in a particular context to best disclose the most relevant truth in that situation

40:49.440 --> 40:55.840
and how action is appropriate to it. Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.

40:59.360 --> 41:04.000
Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.

41:07.360 --> 41:15.280
Think about all of the stoic practices, premeditatio, what Hado calls objective seeing,

41:16.240 --> 41:23.120
the view from above. What are they all designed to do? They're all designed to get you to pay

41:23.120 --> 41:30.080
attention to how the alteration of how you're finding things salient can be

41:32.080 --> 41:39.120
more properly attuned to the underlying reality and that often we are confused

41:40.080 --> 41:45.680
because we fuse inappropriate caring with the underlying reality.

41:50.160 --> 42:01.840
But we can learn to have what we find salient, what we take seriously, properly tutored

42:02.000 --> 42:08.560
so that salience tracks us into what is real, not just in our thoughts but in our whole

42:09.360 --> 42:15.440
sensibility, our whole sense making, our whole comportment, our whole existential orientation

42:16.000 --> 42:23.680
and stance towards reality. This of course is the cultivation of virtue and wisdom.

42:25.760 --> 42:31.040
All of these practices, they may disclose things that are very unpleasant, the premeditatio,

42:32.560 --> 42:38.400
doesn't disclose something, oh death, the fatality of all things. I could lose my loved one tonight.

42:39.440 --> 42:48.000
It's not a pleasant experience. But what does it do? Well, some research on this shows is that

42:48.000 --> 42:56.000
when you do something like this, it releases people from mortality salience. If you just trigger

42:56.000 --> 43:04.000
people about their mortality, they will get very close-minded, very rigid, very defensive

43:04.000 --> 43:11.120
of their worldview. But if you move it into a reflective practice in which you imagine that

43:11.120 --> 43:18.880
you're dying and all the people are around you and then you ask yourself what really matters here

43:18.880 --> 43:24.080
in this most real of real moments and people don't say their possessions or their power,

43:24.080 --> 43:28.240
they say their relationship and because the people they care about are there,

43:28.240 --> 43:35.680
they become open and flexible and loving. This is a beautiful practice even though what is

43:35.680 --> 43:42.720
disclosed is not something that we like or prefer or find smooth. In fact, we are doing our damndest

43:42.720 --> 43:50.880
in our culture to try and smooth over the reality of fatality, the fact that at any moment reality

43:50.880 --> 43:58.320
can smash in to your most narratively cherished projects and our ultimate mortality. We try

43:58.320 --> 44:06.240
our best bullshit around this. But the historic practices can open us up.

44:08.000 --> 44:18.960
They can be beautiful practices that lead us into a deeper ability to be connected to reality.

44:18.960 --> 44:25.840
What would that be? A connection to reality that has rational apprehension, plausible sense-making,

44:25.840 --> 44:30.720
and by the way, you see here that rationality does not reduce to Cartesian logic. I'm talking

44:30.720 --> 44:36.400
more about overcoming self-deception appropriately, proportioning your attention and care to the world.

44:36.960 --> 44:43.520
What would that be? That sense of connectedness to reality that is fundamentally good,

44:43.760 --> 44:55.120
that is not pleasant or pleasurable. That, I put it to you, and I think LaVine is right about this,

44:55.120 --> 45:01.760
or LaVine, that is joy, something the Stoics actually talk very frequently about. And of

45:01.760 --> 45:06.480
course, we've reduced it. Think about what we've done even to the word enjoyment. We've reduced it

45:06.480 --> 45:17.040
to a synonym for experiencing pleasure. But moments of great joy can be very unpleasant.

45:19.760 --> 45:22.560
They can be beyond pleasure. They can be other than pleasure.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.440
One way in which we can get a notion of joy is some of the current work I do, which is the flow

45:33.440 --> 45:38.320
experience that has been talked about by Chick-Sent-Mahai. The flow experience is when you're

45:38.320 --> 45:45.760
doing jazz or martial arts or rock climbing, you get this tremendous narrative nanny,

45:45.760 --> 45:51.600
super ego thing in your head. How am I doing? What do people think of me? How's my hair?

45:51.600 --> 45:57.280
Was my shirt okay? How am I doing? What's my status now? Am I safe? Is there anything interesting

45:57.280 --> 46:02.320
for me? What am I getting out of it? All of that falls silent because you are so deeply connected,

46:02.320 --> 46:07.680
and there's a there's a reciprocal opening, an anagogy. The world is super salient to you,

46:07.680 --> 46:11.360
and you are committing more and more of yourself to it, but you're not being bullshit,

46:11.360 --> 46:18.160
exactly the opposite. You're being led into an intimate causal efficacy and connectedness to

46:18.160 --> 46:28.480
the world because error really matters in the flow state. You're at one. Although you may be

46:28.480 --> 46:35.760
exerting tremendous metabolic energy, you feel graceful. It feels magical. People seek out this

46:35.760 --> 46:43.840
experience. They will reliably tell you it is not. It is not pleasure. Think about rock climbing. It

46:43.840 --> 46:51.040
is absurd. You climb up this rock surface. You're hurting yourself. You're putting yourself at risk

46:51.040 --> 46:56.480
of injury. You're exhausting yourself only once you get to the top to come back down. It sounds

46:56.560 --> 47:01.440
like a Greek mythological torture in Hades. People do it because it gets them into the flow

47:01.440 --> 47:07.440
state. They have, I've argued with Leo Ferraro and Anna Herrabenet that what's happening is an ongoing

47:08.240 --> 47:14.160
insight cascade. Like you're constantly getting more and more insight into what's going on,

47:14.160 --> 47:18.960
and it's calling deeper and deeper into you. You're getting this anagogic at one minute. It's a

47:18.960 --> 47:25.760
deep state of joy. It is not pleasure, and it can be very painful in a lot of ways what you're

47:25.760 --> 47:35.040
doing in that state. Sparring is painful. Rock climbing is painful. And yet people do this.

47:35.040 --> 47:40.240
It is an optimal experience. It is the best experiences. Many people say it's the best

47:40.240 --> 47:45.040
experience they have, and it is where they are at their best. And it is a universal. You find it

47:45.040 --> 47:53.200
across cultures, linguistic groups, socioeconomic status, gender identification, continental

47:53.280 --> 48:00.160
dwelling, etc. People describe this experience in similarity at the level of detail. This is a

48:00.160 --> 48:09.360
universal. It discloses something essential about our functionality. We are made for joy, which is

48:09.360 --> 48:17.920
not pleasure. We are made for this deep one minute, and it is a profound experience for us

48:17.920 --> 48:26.560
because it gives us an intimate, deep connection to our reality that is disclosing itself as

48:26.560 --> 48:33.440
overwhelmingly beautiful. There's an ongoing sense of super salience, but not deception,

48:33.440 --> 48:38.880
a super salience that is making us love what is happening, falling in love with us. There's

48:38.880 --> 48:45.760
ongoing disclosure and discovery, and we're tapping into the inexhaustible intelligibility

48:45.760 --> 48:53.920
of reality. Seneca, even when painted into a corner, it is possible to leap into the sky.

48:57.600 --> 49:03.520
The disciplining of attention and caring, cutting through self-deception in rational

49:03.520 --> 49:13.040
virtuous realization, potentially putting us into a profound flow with nature, another stoic theme,

49:13.040 --> 49:24.000
is a deep enactment of beauty. That is how beauty is implicit in all of stoicism.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.560
Thank you very much for your time and attention.

49:29.360 --> 49:35.520
Ah, John, thank you so much. Everyone, a round of applause in the chat for John Rovegi.

49:36.800 --> 49:40.960
John's going to linger with us for a while, but I'm also aware, John, that you're not feeling

49:40.960 --> 49:45.360
your best, so we'll maybe take a couple of questions and see how we go. Are you okay with that?

49:46.080 --> 49:52.400
Yeah, let's say 15-20 minutes. I think I've got enough cortisol in adrenaline

49:52.400 --> 49:55.840
and enough flow that I can hang on for a bit longer.

49:56.960 --> 50:05.920
I want to say, wow, John, that was elegant. You mentioned that, wow, elegance. That

50:05.920 --> 50:13.200
exclamation of, wow, is that an exclamation of awe and is awe the experience that might be a sign

50:13.920 --> 50:20.480
of beauty, plausibility, et cetera? How do we feel that? How do we recognize that?

50:20.480 --> 50:29.120
So, awe is tricky. I think wonder and wonder flow are definitely experiences of plausibility

50:29.120 --> 50:35.360
and intelligibility. Awe's a little bit different. We thought it would just be

50:36.240 --> 50:39.600
that sort of just more, but we're running some experiments to show

50:41.200 --> 50:45.920
if awe was just that, like what's happening in the flow state, you would expect people to

50:45.920 --> 50:51.760
demonstrate very increased measures of cognitive flexibility after you induce the awe state in

50:51.760 --> 50:57.760
them, and we're not finding that. Now, one of two things might be the case. Awe is really ephemeral,

50:58.560 --> 51:04.400
and that's a real possibility, so take that seriously. Secondly, even if the awe state is

51:04.960 --> 51:11.280
persisting long enough that it should be impacting cognition, and this second proposal is my

51:11.280 --> 51:14.880
favorite because for the completely biased reason that it lines up with my argument,

51:14.880 --> 51:20.400
there's probably an intervening thing that is needed. What awe does is it's one of the few

51:20.400 --> 51:29.360
positive experiences of the shrinking of the self, and if that launches you into the training of

51:29.360 --> 51:38.640
epistemic humility of reverence, then that would probably predict many of the traditional predictions

51:38.640 --> 51:44.160
of how awe improves people. So, this is very much an experimental work and a theoretical

51:44.160 --> 51:47.840
debate work in progress, so that's the best answer I could give you right now.

51:48.320 --> 51:56.320
I think, did you say with the Marcus Aurelius quote, it's not to dwell on or dwell with beauty,

51:56.320 --> 52:03.680
the stars? Dwell on the beauty of that. That's the translation I have. So, is that an intellectual

52:03.680 --> 52:10.960
relationship? Is there an embodied relationship? I think the Stoics, and I mean, I'm going to

52:10.960 --> 52:14.240
speak anachronistically, I'm going to use some of my language for them. I think the Stoics are

52:14.240 --> 52:18.960
very concerned with perspectival and participatory knowing. They are not just concerned with

52:18.960 --> 52:23.040
propositional knowing, and this comes out, of course, in their continual refrain that

52:23.040 --> 52:29.280
philosophical discourse is not the same thing as the proper love of wisdom, because love involves

52:29.280 --> 52:33.520
what you care about, what you find salient, how you're noticing and oriented in the world,

52:33.520 --> 52:37.840
and how you are committing and binding your identity to something. And I think the welling

52:37.840 --> 52:42.400
therefore should be understood as pointing towards that perspectival and participatory knowing.

52:43.120 --> 52:46.880
Okay, I have one more quick question from me, and I'm going to jump into the chat because we've

52:46.880 --> 52:56.320
got some questions. Could you just clarify how to recognize triviality versus plausibility?

52:57.040 --> 53:04.320
Sure. So, plausibility is when you have a balance between the convergence. Many different things

53:04.320 --> 53:11.120
give converge to this realization and the elegance. There's lots of convergence to lots of elegance

53:11.120 --> 53:18.320
and lots of instantiation of an Eidos, right? But there has to be a balance between them.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.320
When you have a lot of convergence, but not much elegance,

53:24.400 --> 53:31.760
then you have a triviality. Can I give an example? Buses stop at stoplights. Okay.

53:33.280 --> 53:37.040
Yeah, you know, you've got a lot of converging evidence for that. You've probably seen it happen

53:37.040 --> 53:42.880
multiple times. Many people will agree with you. Lots of independent collaboration. You don't take

53:42.880 --> 53:48.640
that as a great scientific insight. Buses stop at stoplights. Yeah, and notice what you want to

53:48.640 --> 53:53.920
say here. And what follows from that? What comes from that? Where's the elegance? Well,

53:53.920 --> 53:59.280
there is no elegance, and that's what makes it trivial. That's why the person who spouts triviality

53:59.280 --> 54:04.960
is a bore. They're not lying, but they don't say anything that has consequence for us.

54:05.200 --> 54:10.080
Hmm. Okay. Well, thank you. That was really clear. All right, I'm going to jump into the chat.

54:12.320 --> 54:16.720
Something that Dave Murray said, it's not a question, but it's just an experience. And

54:17.600 --> 54:23.840
yeah, I'm going to start with that. So he said, met a guy just like this at a biker. This is at

54:23.840 --> 54:29.760
the beginning when you were talking about Harry Frankfurt and Bullshit. Met a guy just like this

54:29.760 --> 54:35.840
at a biker bar a couple of weeks back, slung all kinds of bullshit, wanted me to believe him.

54:35.840 --> 54:41.360
He got very upset when I would not agree, haven't been able to stop thinking of that encounter since

54:41.360 --> 54:47.200
not sure I handled it well, felt like I should have clapped along, but not to agree in felt I

54:47.200 --> 54:53.760
should have clapped along, but not to agree internally. All right, so any comments for Dave

54:53.760 --> 54:59.520
on that interaction? Thanks, Dave, for that. Yeah, Dave, that's, I mean, that's a really tricky

54:59.520 --> 55:04.800
situation, especially if it's a stranger. And so you don't have much sense about what you can expect

55:04.800 --> 55:11.840
from the person, you know, is there actually, you know, an implicit possibility of an escalation

55:11.840 --> 55:16.400
potentially into violence or harm. And so I understand, you know, there's care to be taken

55:16.400 --> 55:22.720
here. And there's a there's a cost benefit analysis, like, is it going to cost you much to

55:22.800 --> 55:28.800
challenge this person? If, if please hear the if, if it does come to be the case that there might

55:28.800 --> 55:35.440
be a good reason to challenge. This is where I think learning Socratic practice is really important.

55:35.440 --> 55:39.760
This is what I do in a lot of work I do around dialectic and to the logos. Socrates was very

55:39.760 --> 55:45.840
good at drawing people into the depths of their bullshit, only to have it fall apart in their

55:45.840 --> 55:51.440
hands, so that they would experience a poria. Now that in itself is a dangerous thing to do. And

55:51.440 --> 55:55.840
of course, we all know what they did to Socrates. But the thing is, because a poria gives you a

55:55.840 --> 56:02.400
choice point, you can either retrench even more deeply. And that, right, that is a real possibility.

56:03.280 --> 56:12.160
Or you can do the following, you can open up, you can experience wonder, which is to open oneself

56:12.160 --> 56:20.080
up to call one's world and oneself into question in a beautiful way, in a wonderful way. And so

56:20.160 --> 56:27.120
I would again, please hear all the caveats I put before it. But there are times when people are

56:27.120 --> 56:34.400
bullshitting. Perhaps a relationship is at risk. And somebody is bullshitting. This can often happen

56:34.400 --> 56:42.880
in couples therapy. The therapist often needs to use techniques, largely Socratic in nature,

56:43.680 --> 56:50.080
to try and get the person into a place where they are willing to

56:50.720 --> 56:56.000
disidentify from being a bullshit artist in an important way. See, the problem, as I said,

56:56.000 --> 57:00.240
with bullshitting, and we all know this, the problem if you bullshit a lot is you start to

57:00.240 --> 57:03.680
believe your own bullshit, you don't really believe your bullshit, you fall prey to it.

57:05.520 --> 57:10.720
And so getting people to break out of that cycle, it can be very challenging. But that might be an

57:10.720 --> 57:19.200
instance where doing, posing a Socratic challenge to bullshit might be really necessary, or at least

57:19.200 --> 57:26.880
highly indispensable and needful at the time. Don, you said we can't believe our bullshit.

57:28.080 --> 57:33.360
But we repeat, we say bullshit enough that it just becomes more salient and therefore.

57:33.360 --> 57:39.760
Right. And then we engage in action, which causes us to have certain beliefs. So technically,

57:39.760 --> 57:45.200
we don't believe our bullshit. Our bullshit leads us into being locked into what we find

57:45.200 --> 57:51.920
salient. And then our actions are what cause our bullshit. We can't, sorry, cause our beliefs. We

57:51.920 --> 57:57.920
don't, we can't act a belief. But our actions actually cause our beliefs. And so in that way,

57:57.920 --> 58:06.960
bullshit channels our actions, and then those cause our beliefs. And Pascal, and I don't mean

58:06.960 --> 58:11.840
to say he was promising bullshit, but Pascal was aware of this. When he gave Pascal's wager,

58:11.840 --> 58:16.080
he didn't want, he said very clearly, I don't think it will convince you of God's existence.

58:16.080 --> 58:20.320
What I noticed how this is a really sneaky plausibility argument, what it should do is

58:20.320 --> 58:24.640
take, make you take seriously going into church and lighting a candle, because he knew if he

58:24.640 --> 58:29.840
started to do these things, then things would become salient to you. And then the beliefs would

58:29.840 --> 58:36.240
start to accrue, even though he could not give you any argument for them. Yeah. Yeah. And, and

58:36.240 --> 58:40.800
that's what Marcus Aurelius is doing quite a bit. He's kind of always piecing through things that,

58:40.800 --> 58:44.320
that veil of appearance when you said that I'm thinking of that piecing through

58:44.320 --> 58:50.160
that veil to get to the reality of the food on our plate, the wine in the bottle, etc.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.720
Let me move on to another question.

58:55.440 --> 59:00.080
Mark, Mark Trumbull says, what is the relationship between beauty and confirmation bias?

59:00.400 --> 59:09.360
So that's a very tricky one. And there's a sense in which some more empirical research is needed

59:09.360 --> 59:19.760
at a couple of lynch points. I think confirmation bias is a kind of pornography. And in fact,

59:19.760 --> 59:25.760
I think you can even talk about confirmation porn. And in that sense, it's given my argument

59:25.760 --> 59:31.920
in my use of Han, it is antithetical to beauty, which should startle us and wake us up and make

59:31.920 --> 59:38.480
us ask questions and prepare us for truth that we do not yet have. And so in that sense, beauty,

59:38.480 --> 59:42.880
as I've argued for it here, which of course is not our everyday notion of beauty, I've taken great

59:42.880 --> 59:47.760
care to do it, I did distinguish that, right? Beauty in the sense I've been arguing here would be

59:47.760 --> 59:54.320
the opposite of confirmation bias, which is a kind of cognitive pornography. Yeah. Now,

59:54.320 --> 59:57.840
you have to be careful about this because you can't, this is what I cannot tell you.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:05.280
Don't ever engage in confirmation bias, because that would mean I would rob you of heuristics

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.960
that you need, because what these heuristics, when they're adaptive, what they do is they help you in

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.640
situations, ignore a lot of irrelevant information, focus in on the relevant information. The problem

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:21.200
is for every instant, and this is a formal proof that no free lunch to the theorem,

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.440
for every instance where that heuristic helps you, there's another instance where it equally harms

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:35.840
you. And so you have to get good at ameliorating this and seeing the bias or seeing the heuristic

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:44.000
in context. Thanks, John. I'm just noting the questions in the chat, and I see one from Stacy.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:51.280
Stacy says, would you say the smoothing, and that's in quotations, the smoothing of reality

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:58.240
has created a society that generally has a disdain for or denial of the necessarily complex,

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:05.440
or do we have a yearning at an individual level that can supersede the superficiality created,

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:12.000
the superficially created smoothing? So I think the answer to the first question is yes,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
and I think that's Hahn's argument, so it's more his argument than mine, that the smoothing

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:23.760
locks us into a superficial simplicity instead of a challenging elegance.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.520
About the second point, I think, of course, no one swings free of cultural influence,

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:36.320
but we know there are individual differences, and we know that one of the things in which

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:43.360
there are individual differences is need for cognition. This is how much do you need to go out

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.920
and find problems rather than just waiting to react to problems that are given to you by

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.520
circumstance or other people? Do you seek out problems and challenges that have not been given

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:59.360
to you by reality or by circumstance? And by the way, need for cognition is predictive of

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.880
rationality. Your intelligence is only weakly predictive of rationality, and if you want to

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:08.320
see about that, go look at a whole bunch of other work that I've done and worked by Stanovic

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.880
and a whole bunch of other people. So many individuals have a kind of constitutional resistance

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:23.920
to the demification, the stupification that is happening, and what they do is they seek

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.240
to complexify their cognition because they have a high need for cognition. Now, that is probably,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.520
in some sense, perennially true, but it is also more pertinently true right now because,

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.880
as I've indicated, we have the technological and social acceleration of the strategies of smoothing.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.480
Yeah, thanks, Joan. People that have high need for cognition

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.600
and seek rationality need to seek each other out and find community and mutual support.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.320
So, obvious reference to the group here. Yeah, that's what we're trying to do here.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.720
I'm going to take two more questions from the chat, everyone, and one question from my co-host,

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.960
and hopefully that's going to be good, John. Leonard says, what to do in cases in which authentic

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:21.040
natural salient beauty is indeed misleading? Do you recommend specific contemplative practices

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.080
to recover from self-deception stemming from being blinded by beauty?

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:34.000
So, you have to be, I understand the question, and I'm not being dismissive of it.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:42.160
Typically, what we mean is, let's say, for example, a woman is naturally very beautiful to

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.640
a heterosexual man, just as a prototypical example from literature. I'm not giving it any

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:56.720
moral priority at all. And we say, but that beauty was actually deceptive because she was evil,

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.040
or manipulative, or a liar, and all the horrible tropes, and I know there's sexism bound up with

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:10.560
this, but that has been a prototypical instance of it. Now, you have to be very careful because

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.040
what the natural sexual beauty discloses is actually something like, there's good reason to

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:24.400
believe symmetry in the modern sense of the person's appearance and healthiness of their appearance.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.640
And those are both indicators of, sorry, I don't mean to sound crude, but this is sexual attraction

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:37.440
we're talking about. Those are both indicators of good capacity for sexual reproduction. And so,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:46.720
in that sense, there was no deception. Now, what we can do is we can fall prey to the halo effect,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.240
which is conclude that because the person is naturally attractive, that they are also morally

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.880
virtuous. Now, that thing, the halo effect, you should definitely engage in contemplative

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:06.080
practices to get to more reliably challenge. The halo effect is very, very dangerous. Now,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:10.400
you can see why it evolved because halo effects, people that are attractive will largely

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:17.040
marshal social influence. And if they marshal social influence, you better think well of them

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:24.320
because social power, et cetera. So, we can understand why it's an evolutionary adaptation.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:33.280
But nevertheless, if we could all learn to more successfully challenge the halo effect

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:42.240
and retailer our salience radar, it would do us all very well. And by the way, it helps the people

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.920
who live by the halo effect because eventually it goes away. And I know people like this.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:57.600
And then they're really bereft. They're really bereft. I had, I noticed I was, like many of us,

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:02.000
I had been unsuccessful in the people that I had entered into a romantic relationship with.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:09.680
So, this next time I decided to do something pretty stoic, I think, not to praise myself,

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:17.360
but I decided I'm going to challenge my default automatic attractiveness radar, what grabs my

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:23.920
attention in women, the type that I like, and I'm going to go off type. And so, I met somebody

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:31.360
who I'm now with, one of the best people I've met in my life. And I fell in love with her soul

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:38.160
first because of that. And then I've only come to realize, not only through my own eyes,

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.120
but the eyes of others, that she's actually a physically very attractive woman. And this has

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:50.800
been the best for me that it could possibly be. So, if we are being really careful about what

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:58.560
we're pressing on here, something like the halo effect, yes, yes. I think it's good to challenge

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.000
the halo effect. I don't think that's a particular problem with beauty. I think it's a

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.240
particular problem with our judgments about how we are leaping from, and this is inappropriate

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:17.840
leaping, right? There's good leaping and bad leaping, leaping from the disclosure of some

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:28.640
underlying reality, a kind of capacity for sexual reproduction to making conclusions about

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:32.800
people's moral character. That's where we need to pause and to challenge.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.720
hugely helpful answer, John, and thank you for your question. Okay, one more question from the

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:47.360
chat, and then one more question after that, and we're done. So, Geon has a good little question

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.120
for you, John. Could you share methods to question myself if I am bullshitting or not?

01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:01.120
So, the first thing to do is to adopt a practice of active open-mindedness.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.800
Learn about various cognitive biases, and then first, and you'll find this very easy and pleasurable,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:14.400
identify cognitive biases in other people in newspaper articles or videos or in other people,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:19.360
and you'll be really good at it, and I want you to remember this. You'll be really good at it. We

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.120
are really good at detecting cognitive bias in other people, and then try and apply that to yourself,

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.960
and you'll find that's really hard and you're not very good at it. That's because the Cartesian

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:37.840
monological model of how reason works is dramatically wrong. Reason works socratically,

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.440
it works dialogically. I'm good at identifying your bias, you're good at identifying mine,

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.320
and so what we need to do is regularly engage in socratic dialogue, dialogue with each other,

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:57.920
and so we get more and more capable of doing that, and then eventually, you will start to more and

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.840
more internalize that into an internal dialogue. Remember what Antistony said, he learned to

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:11.200
converse with himself from Socrates, and eventually, you will internalize that ability

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:17.120
to take other people's perspective on your own perspective, and then you will start on your own

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.080
to be able to do active open-mindedness. Oh, that's brilliant, John. Again, I just want to

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.840
bring up Marcus Rades here. I notice that sometimes he does this little dialogic thing,

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.800
he asks a question and then answers it. It's thoughts to himself, right? The meditation is

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:39.600
a dialogical exercise, a dialogical exercise to go through. Yeah, yeah, thanks. That's a great

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.200
question, Geon. Thank you. All right, I'm going to invite my co-host, Phil Yanov, to the stage to

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.920
ask the final question, John. Over to you, Phil. All right, John, thank you for being here today.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.360
Thank you for hanging out with us and sharing your thinking with us and letting us ask you

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.240
questions. It's just been a real gift. I'm going to tell you, I can't wait to go watch this again.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:09.120
I'm glad we're recording this so I can come back and revisit this. And I'm sorry that you're feeling

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:15.360
poorly, but I'll make one last question, one last question. I look forward to your question,

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:22.160
Phil. I really enjoyed our conversation earlier. So thank you. And I did too. And so I'm going to,

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:29.600
you know, we've been talking about beauty and stoicism and it's, I feel it's a romantic notion

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.400
and you've got lots of thinking and we got to put all those pieces together. But I would love

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:43.440
to hear you reflect a little more upon a statement I heard you make in another interview where you

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:50.960
said that, you know, stoicism was kind of a gray area. And what you were saying was,

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.680
maybe it was a religion. And I was trying to get to the thought of what is your thinking in

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.320
was stoicism a philosophy? I mean, they see themselves as the heirs to Aristotle, right?

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.560
Or is it a religion or was it somewhere in the middle or were they bullshitting themselves

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:14.960
about what they were really doing? This is wonderful. So I mean, this is a question other

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.360
people have wrestled with I've looked at I haven't read it thoroughly. So I don't want to claim

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:25.920
competence in it. You know, entire PhD thesis around this question. And it goes around what's

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.880
called the demarcation problem in the social sciences about religion. We don't know what we're

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.440
we have by the way before we go see religion, we have the same problem with science, the demarcation

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.840
problem also exists for science. That's it's very hard to say that's a science and that's not.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:44.560
So the demarcation problem for religion is well, what's a religion is going to a sports stadium

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:49.360
where you go on a specific time with a whole bunch of other people and you cheer and you yell

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:53.520
and you eat together and you chant and you're rooting for these people that are doing

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.080
something that in no way changes the real world. Is that a religious action?

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:05.120
Yes, and that's the right answer. The right answer is me. Is Buddhism a religion? Well,

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:09.920
it could be a philosophy, but it's not right. It's not a philosophy in modern academic sense

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:18.240
of philosophy, but it's it's a love of wisdom. Right. And so I think stoicism is I often use

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:26.240
the the phrase, the hyphenated phrase, it's a religious philosophy or a philosophical religion.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:34.080
Because I think trying to come down hard on a demarcation, it has practices, it has rituals,

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.240
it has community, it has a sacred dimension that you are supposed to come into a participatory

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:47.040
relationship with that transforms you profoundly. I think this is a reason why stoicism was taken

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:54.960
up and becomes a proper part of Neoplatonism, which has found a home in many religious traditions.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:00.080
Right. Of course, there's Neoplatonism within Christianity, within Islam, within Judaism.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:07.120
And of course, there is there's really weird historical inter integrations between something

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:15.120
like Neoplatonism and Vedanta and Buddhism. And so this amazing capacity to enter into

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.400
reciprocal reconstruction with other religions and religious philosophies, it tends to

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.560
to make the religions more philosophically deep and tends to make the philosophies more

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:32.800
religiously transformative. And so I think, you know, I think, I think you have Aristotelian

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.680
science and Neoplatonism, I think you have platonic spirituality that spends that sense of

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:45.120
an agage that I talked about. And there's the mystical. And then stoicism, I think,

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:55.200
it gives you a lot of practices that I think are crucial. I'd be more happy saying that, you know,

01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:02.400
Platonism is a religion, but I also think it is more properly described as a philosophical religion

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.960
or a religious philosophy. What's interesting, I wasn't looking for a definitive answer from you.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.880
I wanted to hear your thinking on this, because I think it is exactly that demarcation problem

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:19.120
and part of it is too. And I've heard you comment on some other things is that, you know,

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.680
there is a hunger for some binding of ourselves to some other philosophical tradition,

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:29.520
which is the thing that you talk about a lot. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing here.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:35.440
Yes, there is. And I think this whole, if it's not presumptuous, but I think you're at least

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.440
affording this, Phil, I think this whole conference is around the sense of religio to be deeply

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:46.800
connected to something that is profoundly and transformatively and beautifully real

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.760
that helps us find the centrality of goodness and the ultimacy of truth from the primacy of beauty

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:59.760
to use DC Schindler. Now, the one thing that I think is interesting, and the problem is the

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:07.280
history gets a little bit hard here, is, is there a place, was there a place for the mystical

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.520
experience that is clearly explicitly present in Neoplatonism? You see it in Plotinus without

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:20.640
question. And of course, it's controversial around whether or not the mystical that sense of, you

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:29.600
know, a profound at one mint with reality is actually something that Stoics report on. I don't

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:39.760
know. I think that part of the history is perhaps lost to us. Maybe it gets submerged under the

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.440
emerging Christianity, maybe gets submerged when it's taken into Neoplatonism. I don't know. I don't

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:53.440
know. I do think that flow with nature, especially if it has connections to what I talk about as flow,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:59.040
I think it's on a continuum with more proper transformative and mystical experiences.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.880
So do you, and I apologize, but I'm going to get one more question, one more answer out of you.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:10.240
That's fine. Do you think those, you know, the, the Zeno's flow and, and I can't say the guy's name

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:14.560
Mahila. Chicks have my eyes. Yeah, check. I, you, every time you say it, I think I should record

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.640
that. So I can say it, but, but those two uses of flow, do you think those are similar enough

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:29.120
to have that conversation? Yeah, I do actually, because I mean, the, the, we tend to over focus

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:33.840
on prototypical instances of flow that come out in athletic performance or martial arts or rock

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.720
climbing, but it also comes out in jazz and it also comes out when you're doing dialectic into

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:45.040
the logos and practice. And we're following the logos the way Socrates says you follow the wind.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:53.840
That, to my mind, is an ongoing practice of insight, improvisation, re-questioning, reopening up

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.920
an ongoing sense of discovery and wonder. And that seems to me to be very much a flow state.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:05.040
Error matters. Socrates will catch you out. You have to be very clear. There's immediate feedback.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.560
These are all the conditions that create flow. I think being in Socrates presence,

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.640
if it was taken up correctly, which is always the existential choice in the face of Socrates,

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.160
could induce a flow state in people. Don is following the wind, the same of sort of stream

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.040
of consciousness, thinking, journaling, writing, following the logos, following the wind.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:31.600
What do you mean by following the wind? Oh, I just thought I thought, I thought you said

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:37.360
following the wind. No, following the logos, like, like, like, like, like a wind, right? Like a wind.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.920
Yeah. It blows and it comes from another direction that we have to reorient. So

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.400
Socrates talks about following the logos as if we're following a wind. Yeah. And of course,

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:50.480
I just thought it just reminded me of kind of a stream of consciousness type following of our

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:56.880
thoughts in that way. No, I don't think see flow is typically different from associational,

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:05.840
like, like that associational thing, because it requires it flow really cares a lot. And there's

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:11.360
a lot more I could have put in my talk. We flow really cares and is afforded by a concern for

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:16.720
intelligibility. If things start to be not make make not make sense for you, you immediately

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.280
fall out of flow. If you start to make a lot of mistakes, you're immediately out of flow.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.040
That's the thing that will snap you out of flow like nothing else. Yeah. All right. I think we

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.600
also have a t-shirt. Well, you're feeling well. I want to bring you back for more questions about

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.240
this particular set of things. But thank you so much for your time today. This has been

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:43.200
thanks, John. I think we have a t-shirt phrase. Beauty is anti bullshit. John Varvage.
