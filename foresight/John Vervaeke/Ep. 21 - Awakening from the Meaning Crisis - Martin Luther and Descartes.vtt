00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
Welcome back to Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.720
Last time we took a look at the advent of the Scientific Revolution and we looked at

00:20.720 --> 00:28.040
the work of Copernicus and how the important advent of a scientific description of reality

00:28.040 --> 00:36.360
had with it the consequence that most of our sensory experience was questionable as

00:36.360 --> 00:38.200
illusory in nature.

00:38.200 --> 00:46.800
Galileo also developed that idea of the math as the language of reality and used that with

00:46.800 --> 00:51.800
the new experimental method, a method also born out of the idea that most of our cognition

00:51.800 --> 00:59.800
is deceptive and biasing in nature and he used that to discover inertial motion and

00:59.800 --> 01:06.200
that changed the notion of matter into something that exists and resists our will.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.640
But that had the effect of killing the universe and making it purposeless in nature.

01:11.640 --> 01:19.440
And thus we become odd islands of meaning and purpose in a vast ocean of meaningless

01:20.280 --> 01:23.960
material motion.

01:23.960 --> 01:30.160
So all of that of course is going to have an impact on people's self-understanding,

01:30.160 --> 01:36.560
their demeaning that they're using to make sense of their existence.

01:36.560 --> 01:42.360
And look what's happening here, that Aristotelian idea that the structure of your experience

01:42.360 --> 01:48.600
and the structure of reality conform has been radically undermined and now you are trapped

01:48.600 --> 01:59.360
within your own mind behind veils of illusion disconnected from the world.

01:59.360 --> 02:06.960
And God has become progressively more and more a matter of will.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.880
There's an individual that takes all of this up and he does more than just think about

02:11.880 --> 02:14.320
this or speak about it or write about it.

02:14.360 --> 02:23.120
He's one of those really titanic individuals who exemplifies the chaos and the anxiety of

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
his time.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.080
This is Martin Luther.

02:26.080 --> 02:29.560
He's definitely deeply influenced.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.560
He's German.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.680
He's deeply influenced by the Rhineland mystics.

02:32.680 --> 02:40.280
He's influenced by that growing tradition of the self as radically self-negating inner

02:40.280 --> 02:46.760
conflict being at the core of spirituality.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.200
He's an Augustinian monk.

02:48.200 --> 02:56.400
He's deeply influenced by Augustine's ideas of self-depravity and our inability to achieve

02:56.400 --> 02:59.880
mystical union with God unaided.

02:59.880 --> 03:06.160
And through Augustine, Luther of course is deeply immersed in and impressed with Paul's

03:06.160 --> 03:13.720
ideas about our inner conflict and now that parallels a conflict within God between God's

03:13.720 --> 03:20.840
love towards us and God's justice driven anger and wrath towards us.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.680
And Martin Luther is very terrified of that wrath.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.800
He's very terrified of it.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.080
And he has taken that notion through taller of mystical self-negation and it has become

03:35.080 --> 03:43.760
radicalized because of the influence of Augustine and Paul and his own inner conflict.

03:43.760 --> 03:50.560
So that the self-negation in Luther's psyche has become self-loathing.

03:50.560 --> 03:58.400
He experiences the self as radically folded into itself, obsessed with itself in a completely

03:58.400 --> 04:01.520
immorally self-centered fashion.

04:01.520 --> 04:12.480
So the self is this radical self-feeding self-negating because as the self is unfolded and obsessed

04:12.480 --> 04:20.480
with itself, it is simultaneously being cut off from God and cut off from reality.

04:20.480 --> 04:29.880
So it is very much a self-destructive process and I really want you to hear that self-destructive

04:29.880 --> 04:34.760
process that he sees as the essence of the self.

04:34.760 --> 04:39.920
So this is Luther's interpretation of the biblical notion of pride and rebellion against

04:39.920 --> 04:49.520
God that we are intrinsically self-obsessed in this self-aggrandizing self-destructive

04:49.520 --> 04:52.480
fashion.

04:52.480 --> 04:59.560
So try to think of moments in your life that will give some substance to what Luther is

04:59.560 --> 05:01.520
saying.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.360
You have discovered a pattern of behavior self-destructive.

05:05.360 --> 05:11.280
For example, perhaps you keep dating the same kind of person and you keep going back to this

05:11.280 --> 05:17.080
and it keeps turning out to be wrong for you, perhaps also wrong for the other person.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.960
So you step back and you've talked to friends and you reflect it and you make a deliberate

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
conscious effort.

05:21.960 --> 05:26.640
No, no, I'm not going to date this person, this kind of person anymore, I'm not going

05:26.640 --> 05:27.640
to date that type of person.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.880
I'm going to date this type of person and that will change things.

05:30.880 --> 05:36.040
I'll break this pattern and you go in and you find somebody, they seem to be totally

05:36.040 --> 05:44.200
different and you start dating them and then lo and behold, against your will, even though

05:44.200 --> 05:49.440
it seems to be something that you willfully brought about, you find yourself caught in

05:49.440 --> 05:53.520
the same destructive pattern again.

05:53.520 --> 06:00.040
Of course Freud and Jung and the whole psychodynamic tradition, very much, part of the legacy of

06:00.040 --> 06:05.400
Luther by the way, are going to make much of that fact that we keep repeating, even

06:05.400 --> 06:12.160
in our conscious efforts to change our behavior, we keep repeating these self-destructive patterns.

06:12.160 --> 06:19.760
So although I'm critical of Luther, there's a deep truth here in Luther, there is the

06:19.760 --> 06:28.600
touching of the way in which our unconscious processes, our unconscious cognition can be

06:28.600 --> 06:33.200
beset with these, we've talked about it, these parasitic processes that have a life of their

06:33.200 --> 06:37.520
own and can consume us.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.600
So Luther is convinced that he cannot do anything to save himself.

06:43.600 --> 06:52.120
He takes Augustine's notion that the Neoplatonic mystical ascent is insufficient on its own

06:52.120 --> 06:57.400
and has to be supplemented with the love of God through Christ.

06:57.400 --> 07:01.560
He takes that and he radicalizes it in a very powerful way.

07:01.560 --> 07:05.760
Because of his own personal wretchedness, he comes to the conclusion that there is nothing

07:05.760 --> 07:11.440
he can do.

07:11.440 --> 07:17.960
And that leads into a startling interpretation of Paul, an interpretation that is going to

07:17.960 --> 07:20.160
put him at odds with the Catholic Church.

07:20.160 --> 07:28.360
This is the interpretation that we are saved by faith alone, where faith becomes nothing

07:28.360 --> 07:38.320
more than a complete acceptance of God's saving grace.

07:38.320 --> 07:44.200
So let's unpack this very carefully because it's become so enmeshed in our way of thinking

07:44.200 --> 07:48.240
and being.

07:48.240 --> 07:58.600
The idea here is that faith is, notice what's happened, all that sense of participatory knowing,

07:58.600 --> 08:01.280
the sense that we're participating in a process.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.440
Remember the Israelite notion that we're participating in our cultural history, we're participating

08:06.440 --> 08:07.960
in the creativity of God.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.000
All of that is now gone.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.680
It's gone.

08:13.680 --> 08:19.160
And your sense of what it's like to be you, your sense of self, is completely twisted

08:19.160 --> 08:20.160
and illusory.

08:20.160 --> 08:24.640
So all the perspectival knowing, all the participatory knowing is being eradicated.

08:24.640 --> 08:32.000
It's being reduced down to the acceptance of a proposition.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.960
And an acceptance that cannot in any way be based on evidence or argument.

08:36.960 --> 08:42.320
Because that would be your mind participating in your salvation.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.440
It has to be a radical, pure acceptance.

08:46.440 --> 08:56.560
So the self-negation of the Rhineland mystics has come to fruition in Luther's ideas here.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.840
Now what does that mean?

08:59.840 --> 09:05.200
That means that what you radically, radically have to accept is there's absolutely nothing

09:05.200 --> 09:07.440
you can do.

09:07.440 --> 09:16.120
And even your affirmation of the proposition of the creed of Christianity is something

09:16.120 --> 09:21.080
that has to be given to you.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.760
And what does that mean from God's side of this equation?

09:23.760 --> 09:28.920
It means that God's act of saving you is completely arbitrary.

09:28.920 --> 09:37.920
There is, since there is nothing you do, there's no thought, word or deed that you perform

09:37.920 --> 09:45.840
that in any way earns or has any causal effect upon God's behavior.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.920
And I'm not over-representing this.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.280
Look at the debate between Luther and Erasmus.

09:51.280 --> 09:57.820
Erasmus tried to propose what he called synergy, that the human being and God were working

09:57.820 --> 10:02.260
together in a participatory fashion for salvation, with God, of course, having the bulk of the

10:02.260 --> 10:03.260
work.

10:03.260 --> 10:06.260
And Luther rejects that utterly.

10:06.260 --> 10:11.900
God's saving of an individual is completely arbitrary.

10:11.900 --> 10:18.380
So God has become, remember what we talked about in Occam, that God's will supersedes

10:18.380 --> 10:19.380
his reason.

10:19.380 --> 10:25.820
God's reason is now not involved at all.

10:25.820 --> 10:31.100
It is just an arbitrary act of will that saves us.

10:31.100 --> 10:37.460
And we have to radically accept that arbitrariness.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.580
Now think about what that means.

10:40.580 --> 10:44.820
And there's a weird, there's an irony here.

10:44.820 --> 10:49.420
There's an irony here, and it's almost a self-referential irony.

10:49.420 --> 10:57.580
Because Luther is trying, and I think he's very sincere, but he's trying to rescue us

10:57.580 --> 11:07.460
from the fact that we are obsessed with ourself in an idolatrous fashion, and that that obsession

11:07.460 --> 11:11.300
is a source of deep suffering for us.

11:11.300 --> 11:21.060
We know that that self-obsession cuts us off, separates us.

11:21.060 --> 11:27.220
But the irony is, in his endeavors to deal with that, look at what Luther is teaching.

11:27.220 --> 11:32.340
What is he putting into our cultural grammar?

11:32.340 --> 11:41.340
That we are inherently worthless, and that our inner life is one of self-loathing.

11:41.340 --> 11:52.460
And the only solution to that is arbitrary, unearned regard.

11:52.460 --> 11:57.620
This is the cultural training for narcissism.

11:57.620 --> 12:08.100
Narcissism is to be trapped, to be self-obsessed within self-loathing, and that what you want

12:08.100 --> 12:14.340
to alleviate is unearned positive regard.

12:14.340 --> 12:22.640
Not for any reason, not for anything you've done, completely amoral unearned positive

12:22.640 --> 12:23.640
regard.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.020
That's narcissism.

12:25.500 --> 12:33.060
One of the deep ironies of Luther's revolution is that, and I think there says something

12:33.060 --> 12:39.700
about what's going on at the time, one of the deep ironies is he actually lays the grammar

12:39.700 --> 12:44.360
for cultural narcissism.

12:44.360 --> 12:51.500
We are all being trained to experience ourselves as wretched, self-obsessed, and that the only

12:51.500 --> 12:57.020
solution is unearned positive regard.

12:57.020 --> 13:09.720
And so we can see the spirit of Luther in our obsession with Instagram, in our obsession

13:09.720 --> 13:11.400
with Snapchat.

13:11.400 --> 13:17.540
We constantly want unearned positive regard.

13:18.540 --> 13:23.620
Now, there are other consequences of this radical change.

13:23.620 --> 13:30.780
Of course, immediate consequences, Luther comes into conflict.

13:30.780 --> 13:35.020
He protests against the Roman Catholic Church.

13:35.020 --> 13:40.460
That's what Protestant comes from, because the Catholic Church has a different doctrine

13:40.460 --> 13:51.060
of salvation, that it's one in which the human being still has a participatory role.

13:51.060 --> 13:58.340
And because of that, the Church also thinks that it's cultural history.

13:58.340 --> 14:00.700
Think about how this is still an Israelite notion.

14:00.700 --> 14:07.180
The Church still thinks that its tradition matters for human salvation, that participating

14:07.180 --> 14:12.980
in that tradition, the tradition, the cultural history of the Church, is also something that

14:12.980 --> 14:16.140
is needed.

14:16.140 --> 14:18.900
Now I'm not advocating for Catholicism here over Protestantism.

14:18.900 --> 14:27.620
I'm trying to get you to understand what the two sides were standing for.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.420
So Luther is attacking all of that.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.660
He's attacking the authority of the Church.

14:31.660 --> 14:34.140
He's attacking the authority of tradition.

14:34.140 --> 14:40.380
So history and tradition and institution don't matter.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.620
Why?

14:42.620 --> 14:46.180
Because Luther is a child of his time.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.180
He is trapped inside his own mind.

14:49.180 --> 15:00.380
He advocates that all that really matters in matters of faith are individual conscience.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.460
And please remember what this word means.

15:02.460 --> 15:08.580
It means knowing yourself, science, conscience, knowing yourself.

15:08.580 --> 15:14.900
The one thing you know is yourself.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.580
And so Luther refuses to recant.

15:18.580 --> 15:25.540
He refuses to change his interpretation, to be in line with the Church, and he valorizes

15:25.540 --> 15:34.340
individual conscience as the final authority over a person's spiritual life.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.340
This lays the foundation.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.020
So do you see what's happened here?

15:37.020 --> 15:43.240
This withdrawal of meaning into the individual mind, isolated individual mind, is now being

15:43.240 --> 15:48.940
appropriated as, well that must mean that the mind, the individual conscience, is the

15:48.940 --> 15:53.940
final soul authority of what matters.

15:53.940 --> 15:55.660
It's a radical idea.

15:55.660 --> 16:02.460
Many other cultures find this a bizarre idea that we possess in the West.

16:02.460 --> 16:08.900
And so of course there's a lot of discussion nowadays about individual responsibility, individual

16:08.900 --> 16:09.900
authority.

16:09.900 --> 16:14.820
We have, as Adorno talked about it, we have a cult of authenticity.

16:14.820 --> 16:22.900
That being true to yourself, and this is Lutheran, being true to yourself is the ultimate authority

16:23.020 --> 16:26.780
by which you should judge and evaluate your life.

16:26.780 --> 16:31.340
Now notice what has happened.

16:31.340 --> 16:39.900
The connection to reality, being true to reality, has been superseded by being true to yourself.

16:39.900 --> 16:46.900
And that is also emerging with a cultural grammar that is training us in narcissism.

16:53.700 --> 17:03.580
Now because of this, Luther was a monk, and yet he comes to the conclusion that the monasteries

17:03.580 --> 17:05.860
should be shut down.

17:05.860 --> 17:08.140
Why would he come to that conclusion?

17:08.220 --> 17:17.220
Well, the West, for a long time, had these paired institutions.

17:17.220 --> 17:23.140
We had a knowledge institution that has already emerged and is being developed in the Middle

17:23.140 --> 17:30.220
Ages, and this of course is the university, where it's supposed to get a universal education,

17:30.220 --> 17:36.180
come to understand as much of reality, the universe as you can.

17:36.180 --> 17:45.980
And that was paired to a place where you have to go through transformation in order to acquire

17:45.980 --> 17:50.740
wisdom, and this is the monastery.

17:50.740 --> 17:59.740
And so this is the idea here, that here you're seeking that self-transcendence.

18:00.460 --> 18:06.460
This is the legacy of the Axial Revolution.

18:06.460 --> 18:11.620
This of course is a response to the emergence of first Aristotelian science, and then the

18:11.620 --> 18:18.620
new science of people like Bacon, Copernicus Galileo.

18:18.620 --> 18:25.820
And the two are supposed to represent an important synthesis of how human beings are to make sense

18:25.820 --> 18:31.500
of themselves and to find a meaningful life.

18:31.500 --> 18:45.020
But this institution places a huge premium on self-transcendence, as we've seen.

18:45.020 --> 18:53.180
And for Luther, this is the Grand Illusion, the idea that human beings are capable of

18:53.180 --> 19:03.300
self-transcendence is something he thinks is the greatest lie that our self tells us.

19:03.300 --> 19:09.900
He sees that as the greatest instance of the sin of pride.

19:09.900 --> 19:17.700
See if you lose the perspectival participatory sense of faith, if faith just becomes assertion

19:17.700 --> 19:29.820
born out of radical acceptance, then the idea of this being even possible to you disappears.

19:29.820 --> 19:39.060
And so what happens is that these institutions are being shut down.

19:39.060 --> 19:45.380
Now that means the university now needs something else in order to take this knowledge and give

19:45.380 --> 19:50.140
it existential transformative relevance to individual lives.

19:50.140 --> 19:57.280
The university has to be attached to something else that transforms people's lives, gives

19:57.280 --> 19:59.780
structure and purpose to their existence.

19:59.780 --> 20:04.580
And of course, we know what that's going to be.

20:04.580 --> 20:07.300
That's going to be the state.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.540
And knowledge is not going to be linked so much to wisdom.

20:10.540 --> 20:16.700
It's going to be linked to politics.

20:16.700 --> 20:24.620
And of course, that is going to be supported by the new science, people like Bacon famously

20:24.620 --> 20:34.220
arguing that knowledge is power, the forerunner of the work of Michel Foucault and others.

20:34.220 --> 20:43.860
So we get the loss of all the psychotechnologies of wisdom, of cultural communities that are

20:43.860 --> 20:48.380
committed to providing guidance and support to people who want to cultivate wisdom, of

20:48.380 --> 20:53.860
a historical tradition that can relay to us the patterns of success and failures and

20:53.860 --> 20:58.820
give us practices that we can use to test out and try for transformation.

20:58.820 --> 21:01.100
All of that is being lost.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.980
So you know where to go for information.

21:03.980 --> 21:11.420
You know where to go for knowledge, but now today you do not know where to go for wisdom.

21:11.420 --> 21:21.680
We have sapiential obsolescence of our knowledge.

21:21.680 --> 21:31.220
And we have knowledge being inextricably bound to the machinery of the state and to politics,

21:31.220 --> 21:39.660
such that it is becoming increasingly difficult right now for us as a culture to distinguish

21:39.660 --> 21:49.980
politics from knowledge, from the willful assertion of things that we must simply accept

21:49.980 --> 21:59.660
because of an arbitrary will wielding power.

21:59.660 --> 22:08.540
So the Protestant Reformation is titanic.

22:08.540 --> 22:16.300
It is really inappropriate if you're trying to understand the advent of the meaning crisis

22:16.300 --> 22:18.260
to only look at the scientific revolution.

22:18.260 --> 22:23.940
You must look at the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation together.

22:23.940 --> 22:29.700
They are conjoined.

22:29.700 --> 22:39.260
Now there are other important aspects of the Protestant Reformation that come to the fore.

22:39.260 --> 22:45.140
Because of his attack on tradition and institution, Luther advocates what he calls the priesthood

22:45.140 --> 22:47.580
of all believers.

22:47.580 --> 22:49.860
There is nothing in between.

22:49.860 --> 22:57.420
There is no mediator between you and God.

22:57.420 --> 22:58.820
There is no church.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.300
There is no priest.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.740
There is nothing here.

23:01.740 --> 23:07.420
There is just a direct personal relationship.

23:07.420 --> 23:16.900
Again this idea of your own personal spirituality has its root here.

23:17.380 --> 23:23.860
Because of this, Luther argues that for the priesthood of all believers, everybody has

23:23.860 --> 23:27.060
an equal spiritual authority.

23:27.060 --> 23:34.180
Because of course learning processes of growth and self-transformation, those are no longer

23:34.180 --> 23:36.340
important criteria.

23:36.340 --> 23:40.900
All that matters is the degree to which God has saved someone.

23:40.900 --> 23:44.500
Now we've talked about some of the negative consequences of that, but a positive consequence

23:44.500 --> 23:52.700
for that is that Luther argues for a complete form of democracy within the church.

23:52.700 --> 23:59.460
Everything should be decided democratically because there should not be any significant

23:59.460 --> 24:01.580
authority or hierarchical structure.

24:01.580 --> 24:04.300
Because Luther is rejecting all of that.

24:04.300 --> 24:11.340
This of course is why the Catholic Church is so resisting to him, why they are so inimical

24:11.340 --> 24:12.340
to him.

24:12.980 --> 24:20.780
This idea eradicated because it undermines the very structure and existence of the institution

24:20.780 --> 24:23.900
of the Catholic Church.

24:23.900 --> 24:29.180
Now Luther doesn't propose political democracy.

24:29.180 --> 24:32.940
He only proposes democracy within the church, but nevertheless that is going to give people

24:32.940 --> 24:41.060
in their day-to-day lives experience with democratic processes, democratic decision-making.

24:41.060 --> 24:45.060
In fact, in the areas that they consider most important about their lives, they are going

24:45.060 --> 24:47.380
to be acting democratically.

24:47.380 --> 24:57.740
Now Luther thinks that there shouldn't be democracy in the world outside of the church,

24:57.740 --> 25:05.620
and when the peasants revolt in Germany because they are being influenced by this idea of

25:05.620 --> 25:10.420
the importance of the individual, individual conscience and authority, Luther does not

25:10.420 --> 25:15.980
side with the peasants, he sides with the princes, he sides with established authority.

25:15.980 --> 25:21.220
He has a two-worlds doctrine, there is a doctrine within the church and that is a world that

25:21.220 --> 25:23.580
is, remember how God is divided, right?

25:23.580 --> 25:26.980
That is the world of God's love and that is where we act democratically.

25:26.980 --> 25:31.860
But outside the church we don't know who is saved and who is not saved, we will come back

25:31.860 --> 25:32.860
to that point.

25:32.860 --> 25:37.220
And because of that, that is the world under God's wrath, then that is the world that has

25:37.220 --> 25:44.740
to be kept in check by political authority, wielding the sword of power.

25:44.740 --> 25:59.140
Again, that is a dark aspect of Luther, but it also brings with it the beginning of an

25:59.140 --> 26:05.780
idea of the separation of church and state, radical new idea.

26:05.780 --> 26:09.580
And Luther of course is proposing it because he is proposing it that within the church,

26:09.580 --> 26:14.940
under God's love, people should be treated one way and outside of the church, which is

26:14.940 --> 26:19.020
under God's wrath, there should be a different way in which people are treated and politically

26:19.020 --> 26:24.340
operate and the state should not interfere with the church.

26:24.340 --> 26:29.660
So we get the beginnings of separation of church and state, which we take for granted,

26:29.660 --> 26:35.740
but this is going to further drive the secularization of the culture, it's going to further drive

26:35.740 --> 26:44.180
the secularization of the culture, because more and more people are experiencing that

26:44.180 --> 26:56.420
sacred as something private, separate, secluded unto itself, separate from the state and politics

26:56.420 --> 27:07.020
and of course also science and the university.

27:07.020 --> 27:14.500
Now that not knowing who saved, of course, also brings with it terrific problems.

27:14.500 --> 27:19.380
This was made into a classic argument, which has come under some criticism, but I think

27:19.380 --> 27:23.540
the core insight is still a value by Max Weber.

27:23.540 --> 27:34.940
The problem with Luther's model is there's nothing you can do to know that you're saved,

27:34.940 --> 27:39.880
because there is nothing you can do to bring, you have no causal role, which means there's

27:39.880 --> 27:45.820
no causal evidence, there's no evidence, how do you know if you're saved?

27:45.820 --> 27:51.300
Because God chooses people arbitrarily.

27:51.300 --> 27:58.020
So this provokes terrific anxiety, there's tremendous anxiety about whether or not you're

27:58.020 --> 27:59.020
saved.

27:59.020 --> 28:03.700
You have your own, and Luther gives you, there's this dramatic tension in Luther, he gives

28:03.700 --> 28:09.140
you this double bind.

28:09.140 --> 28:13.740
He tells you that what you ultimately have to rely on is your individual conscience,

28:13.740 --> 28:24.740
but he tells you that that inner world is one of overwhelming self-deception.

28:24.740 --> 28:27.260
And so what do you do with this anxiety?

28:27.260 --> 28:33.980
Well, you can't do anything officially, but what you can do is you can work hard to make

28:33.980 --> 28:37.220
your life good.

28:37.220 --> 28:44.700
Because if you're succeeding in the world, especially socioeconomic success, that surely

28:44.700 --> 28:50.860
is a sign that God has chosen you, that God loves you.

28:50.860 --> 28:56.980
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to develop what becomes called the present work ethic.

28:56.980 --> 29:03.340
Because my only way of knowing is this unofficial way, this relatively unconscious way of knowing

29:03.340 --> 29:07.420
that I'm saved, is if I'm succeeding well, so I'm going to work hard to succeed.

29:07.420 --> 29:15.900
And I'm not going to use my wealth in any way to promote myself.

29:15.900 --> 29:20.100
I'm not going to do what would later be called conspicuous consumption, because that would

29:20.100 --> 29:23.140
be a sign of pride.

29:23.140 --> 29:30.060
So I work hard, and in order to avoid pride, I'm going to push the money, the wealth I

29:30.060 --> 29:31.980
acquire back into my business.

29:31.980 --> 29:35.220
I'm going to get the present work ethic.

29:35.220 --> 29:39.500
And this is going to align so well with the emerging corporations.

29:39.500 --> 29:45.340
We talked about the emerging ascendancy of the commercial class, and we get the advent

29:45.340 --> 29:49.580
of capitalism.

29:49.580 --> 30:01.460
As Weber's book famously puts it, the present work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

30:01.460 --> 30:05.060
And this worry is a real worry.

30:05.060 --> 30:09.380
This is what you watch happen.

30:09.380 --> 30:15.020
And what's amazing is how Luther was surprised by this.

30:15.020 --> 30:21.020
For a man who is in many ways brilliant, he translates the Bible into German, by the way.

30:21.020 --> 30:26.820
He makes the Bible readable for everybody because of the priesthood of all believers.

30:26.820 --> 30:28.500
And he's a brilliant translator.

30:28.500 --> 30:34.700
Many people consider him as one of the foundational figures of modern German.

30:34.700 --> 30:42.060
But he honestly thought that everybody would read the Bible the same way he did.

30:42.060 --> 30:49.060
So he thought we'd gotten rid of the Pope, but there would be a unifying thing that would

30:49.060 --> 30:52.260
hold Christianity together, which is the idea of the Bible.

30:52.260 --> 30:56.980
So the Bible becomes very holy, and many people have said that what Protestants have is a

30:56.980 --> 30:58.460
paper pope.

30:58.460 --> 31:03.220
The Bible takes the role for them that the pope does for the Catholic world.

31:03.220 --> 31:08.900
And of course, we are facing struggles right now in our culture because we don't quite

31:08.900 --> 31:18.780
know what to do with this terrible and awesome book, The Bible.

31:18.780 --> 31:27.580
What shocked Luther and shouldn't shock us is that Protestantism quickly fragments because

31:27.580 --> 31:36.900
when you give people no authority other than their own individual conscience, when you

31:36.900 --> 31:45.080
separate them from any claims upon them of tradition, any claims upon them of history

31:45.080 --> 31:54.700
or institution, any claims upon them of knowledge, the idea that they will all agree is actually

31:54.700 --> 31:57.540
a ridiculous idea.

31:57.540 --> 32:05.640
And so what happens and continues to happen to this very day is the huge and ongoing and

32:05.640 --> 32:11.480
accelerating fragmentation of Protestantism into denomination after denomination after

32:11.480 --> 32:14.480
denomination.

32:14.480 --> 32:20.040
You get what has been called in other quarters, but can be applied here, the narcissism of

32:20.040 --> 32:26.960
small difference, right?

32:26.960 --> 32:32.920
You have to find that piece of evidence that shows that you are unique, that shows that

32:32.920 --> 32:42.720
of all of the damned masses, God has elected you, your uniqueness, your specialness, your

32:42.720 --> 32:47.080
unearned unique specialness has to be guaranteed.

32:47.080 --> 32:51.520
And the more I'm like these other people, the more that comes into question.

32:51.520 --> 32:57.600
So not only am I driven by my own radicalized subjectivity in my interpretation, I'm also

32:57.600 --> 33:05.680
hungry for a mark of specialness for me that will show that I am saved.

33:05.680 --> 33:12.520
And so the narcissism and the fragmentation of Protestantism walk, march, in lock, step

33:12.520 --> 33:21.720
together, mutually accelerating.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.360
So notice what's happened.

33:24.360 --> 33:35.040
Take a look, you're getting, God is withdrawing, God's withdrawing.

33:35.040 --> 33:42.960
By the time of Luther, God has become very much this arbitrary will in a world that is

33:42.960 --> 33:50.040
nothing but a battle of wills.

33:50.040 --> 33:56.160
Think about how not that long after Luther, you have Shakespeare.

33:56.160 --> 34:03.640
Luther is the great writer of German, Shakespeare is the great writer of English.

34:04.040 --> 34:13.000
Notice how somebody who is plumbing the depths of the human psyche, Shakespeare, in a way

34:13.000 --> 34:21.600
that of course has struck most of us as perennially profound, how absent God is from that world

34:21.600 --> 34:23.720
of Shakespeare.

34:23.720 --> 34:30.680
There's supernaturals there, there are the witches in Macbeth, there are ghosts in Hamlet,

34:30.680 --> 34:41.560
but God is not ever present and the supernatural is absurd and arbitrary and largely an agent

34:41.560 --> 34:52.880
of chaos and a destiny that thwarts people in their endeavors.

34:52.880 --> 35:04.280
It's telling how much God has withdrawn into being an arbitrary, absurd supernatural agency

35:04.280 --> 35:13.080
that largely thwarts and undermines human activities.

35:13.080 --> 35:22.280
So the Protestant Reformation is fundamental to our grammar of how we understand ourselves

35:22.280 --> 35:29.880
and the problem is even though many of us are children of the secularization that is

35:29.880 --> 35:35.000
accelerated by the Protestant Reformation, we still carry that grammar around in our

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
head.

35:36.000 --> 35:44.360
We have to work hard, we have to work very hard and if we don't work hard, it's going

35:44.360 --> 35:50.400
to be revealed how worthless we are.

35:50.400 --> 35:56.560
And that we hunger for that unearned positive regard.

35:56.560 --> 36:06.720
We need to find that mark of our uniqueness that shows that we are chosen from the damned

36:06.720 --> 36:11.880
and that we will not disappear into nothingness and meaninglessness, but instead we will be

36:11.880 --> 36:20.320
adored for simply who we are.

36:21.320 --> 36:30.640
Now, all of these factors, the scientific revolution, the advent of the beginnings of

36:30.640 --> 36:38.360
capitalism, especially corporate capitalism, and the Protestant Reformation are all mutually

36:38.360 --> 36:44.840
reinforcing each other, they're giving people tremendous anxiety.

36:44.840 --> 36:48.760
So the scientific revolution is basically cutting you off from the world and the Protestant

36:48.760 --> 36:54.920
Reformation is basically offending you from the mother church and tradition and history.

36:54.920 --> 36:59.920
Look, you have to bear it all.

36:59.920 --> 37:06.640
You alone, by yourself, you have to bear it all while simultaneously being told you don't

37:06.640 --> 37:14.680
have the resources or the capacity within you to do it.

37:14.680 --> 37:22.320
There are nothing that has to bear it all.

37:22.320 --> 37:28.280
You cut off from the world, you cut off from reality, behind illusion, there's a restless

37:28.280 --> 37:38.000
battle of wills, you cut off from wisdom institutions with sapiential obsolescence.

37:38.000 --> 37:44.440
So this is a time of a lot of existential dread.

37:44.440 --> 37:53.960
You see the very thoughtful response of people like Pascal, who is now experiencing the cosmos

37:53.960 --> 37:56.440
not as a cosmos.

37:56.440 --> 38:01.460
Remember what cosmos means, a beautiful order that we can participate in and that will afford

38:01.460 --> 38:02.960
our self-transcendence.

38:02.960 --> 38:09.520
No, Pascal, who's a mathematical genius, he gets the new math, he looks out at the cosmos

38:09.520 --> 38:17.240
and he says, those infinite spaces terrify me.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.960
The cosmos is now cold and terrifying.

38:20.960 --> 38:27.440
Its vastness is inhuman and crippling of the human spirit.

38:27.440 --> 38:44.640
There's an individual who arises at the same time and wants to address this anxiety.

38:44.640 --> 38:50.960
And we'll talk about the comparison between Pascal and this person.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.880
This person's Rene Descartes.

38:52.880 --> 39:01.000
Descartes wants to take this grammar of the scientific revolution about math as the marker

39:01.000 --> 39:08.280
of reality and he wants to use it to come up with, on his own, like a good Protestant,

39:08.280 --> 39:11.640
although he's Catholic, but on his own, from his own individual consciousness.

39:11.640 --> 39:15.480
He wants to come up on his own, forget the history, forget the tradition.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.480
This is Descartes.

39:17.080 --> 39:28.840
I'm going to use the new math to come up with a solution to this emerging meaning crisis.

39:28.840 --> 39:32.920
Descartes is a genius.

39:32.920 --> 39:40.320
And what he does is he invents a new psychotechnology, one of the most powerful psychotechnologies,

39:40.320 --> 39:44.960
a psychotechnology that has been so internalized into our culture and our cognition that it

39:44.960 --> 39:46.460
is almost transparent to us.

39:46.460 --> 39:54.540
We do not realize it is the lens by which we see and understand the world.

39:54.540 --> 39:57.260
Descartes liked to sleep in.

39:57.260 --> 40:03.400
It's probably led to his death because when he had to go to Sweden, they didn't let him

40:03.400 --> 40:08.520
sleep in and he had to go out in the cold air and that's probably what led to his death.

40:08.520 --> 40:12.280
So he liked to sleep in.

40:12.280 --> 40:17.300
So one day he's laying in bed and it was the fashion at the time, the architectural fashion,

40:17.300 --> 40:20.620
further to be tiling on the floor and tiling on the walls.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.340
There's a fly flying around the room.

40:23.340 --> 40:26.740
Now, for most of us, that's where we, that's, that's it.

40:26.740 --> 40:28.860
That's all we get, fly in a room.

40:28.860 --> 40:34.380
But Descartes notes that if he, he noted that if he counts the number of tiles along, right,

40:34.380 --> 40:39.820
these three axes, he can come up with three numbers that will plot wherever the fly is

40:39.820 --> 40:42.680
in the room.

40:42.680 --> 40:55.320
Descartes invents Cartesian graphing, the system we use today, the XYZ system.

40:55.320 --> 41:03.440
He takes the new algebra, the new way in which, right, the new way in which Galileo had been

41:03.440 --> 41:06.600
using math and he pushes it even further.

41:06.600 --> 41:10.620
He invents graphing.

41:10.620 --> 41:15.660
And what, what psychotechnology, because that's what it is.

41:15.660 --> 41:19.820
This is a standardized strategy.

41:19.820 --> 41:25.460
Learn from your society, a socialized, standardized strategy for information processing.

41:25.460 --> 41:34.700
What psychotechnology more means science to you than a graph.

41:35.240 --> 41:39.000
When I can make a graph, I'm doing science.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.680
When I can think graphically, I'm thinking scientifically.

41:43.680 --> 41:51.520
This is one of the most powerful and pervasive psychotechnologies, and he invents it.

41:51.520 --> 41:58.640
And this brings with it a powerful idea, because he invents analytic geometry.

41:58.640 --> 42:09.500
Any geometrical shape can be converted into an algebraic equation.

42:09.500 --> 42:21.260
Equations capture reality, because, remember what Galileo has done, math doesn't have to

42:21.260 --> 42:27.860
look like, it doesn't have to share the same gestalt as what it's representing.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.920
That has now been taken to its fulfillment in Descartes.

42:30.920 --> 42:39.640
Equations are not in any way like what they represent, but nevertheless, following up

42:39.640 --> 42:46.080
on Copernicus and Galileo, they are what cut through illusion into reality.

42:46.080 --> 42:50.680
Now this is a radical idea.

42:50.680 --> 42:55.200
Because of graphing and analytic geometry, we get this idea that we can grasp the world

42:55.200 --> 42:56.320
with equations.

42:56.320 --> 43:05.620
So you think that this captures something deep about the world, E equals MC squared,

43:05.620 --> 43:08.780
and you should.

43:08.780 --> 43:14.420
Because when you really understand this, you can take a paperclip worth of matter, and

43:14.420 --> 43:24.340
you can smash a city to the ground, men and women, like gods.

43:24.340 --> 43:32.200
It's intoxicating the power that it puts at our fingertips.

43:32.200 --> 43:40.900
It seems to provide overwhelming evidence that this way of thinking puts us deeply in

43:40.900 --> 43:44.980
touch with the fiber and fabric of reality.

43:44.980 --> 43:52.280
We are fundamentally in contact, but it's not a contact of experience.

43:52.280 --> 43:54.380
It's not the Aristotelian conformity.

43:54.380 --> 43:56.700
It's not participatory.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.900
It is purely propositional.

43:58.900 --> 44:00.940
It is purely abstract.

44:00.940 --> 44:07.220
It is purely symbolic.

44:07.220 --> 44:19.020
Now that's going to bring with it a radical idea.

44:19.020 --> 44:27.280
Descartes thinks, well you know what, this is how I can understand the meaning crisis.

44:27.280 --> 44:31.360
All this anxiety, he didn't of course call it the meaning crisis, so that's anachronistic

44:31.360 --> 44:32.360
on my part.

44:32.360 --> 44:38.720
But I'm putting words into his mouth so that we can talk to him across space and time.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.920
There's all this anxiety.

44:39.920 --> 44:42.120
There's all this sense of disconnection.

44:42.120 --> 45:01.620
So Descartes understands the meaning crisis as a lack of a search for certainty.

45:01.620 --> 45:10.860
Conformity in the Aristotelian, the Neoplatonic sense, participatory, perspectival conformity

45:10.860 --> 45:18.360
has been replaced by propositional certainty.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.960
And of course the thing about math for Descartes is it gives you certainty.

45:21.960 --> 45:28.760
That's why math cuts through all the illusions.

45:28.760 --> 45:39.480
That's why it allows us access to such power.

45:39.480 --> 45:50.580
So Descartes thinks the answer to the crisis is to transform our minds, not in any kind

45:50.580 --> 46:00.060
of spiritual transformation, but to transform our minds into machines of certainty.

46:00.060 --> 46:09.720
Equations that will only work mathematically and logically in terms of equations.

46:09.720 --> 46:18.320
The way to get certainty is to turn myself into a machine that represents the world to

46:18.320 --> 46:26.480
abstract symbolic propositions and then manipulate those propositions in a purely logical mathematical

46:26.480 --> 46:29.680
function.

46:30.100 --> 46:41.380
What Descartes is proposing is that the way to address the anxiety of the age is for each

46:41.380 --> 46:49.020
one of us to adopt a method that will turn us into computers.

46:49.020 --> 46:54.020
That's what a computer is.

46:54.020 --> 46:58.040
Computer is originally a word applied to people, by the way.

46:58.040 --> 47:02.200
In the 1930s or 40s, you could have a job as a computer.

47:02.200 --> 47:11.080
If that was your job, you would be given the task of taking equations and processing them

47:11.080 --> 47:16.840
in a logical mathematical fashion.

47:16.840 --> 47:22.600
So reasoning is being reduced to computation.

47:22.620 --> 47:28.700
We'll talk about what that might mean in a minute.

47:28.700 --> 47:36.060
The idea is if we can make our minds into purely computational machines, then we will

47:36.060 --> 47:38.500
achieve certainty.

47:38.500 --> 47:47.260
Certainty in our beliefs will give us what Descartes thinks we need in order to alleviate

47:47.260 --> 47:49.300
the anxiety that we're suffering.

47:49.320 --> 47:55.880
Of course, we do that, right?

47:55.880 --> 48:01.960
On one hand, we have the cultural grammar of Luther and the narcissism and the radical

48:01.960 --> 48:02.960
self-doubt.

48:02.960 --> 48:07.000
On the other hand, we have the Cartesian grammar.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.880
We seek certainty.

48:09.880 --> 48:13.040
We won't believe anything until it's certain.

48:13.040 --> 48:17.680
Of course, we vacillate between, I must accept it without any evidence or reason, Luther.

48:17.740 --> 48:23.340
I can only accept it if it's absolutely certain and beyond question, Descartes.

48:23.340 --> 48:28.180
And both of these, of course, are pathological.

48:28.180 --> 48:34.060
The first is pathological because if you completely remove people's agency in how they come to

48:34.060 --> 48:42.180
their beliefs, then you radically undermine any meaning in life they might possess.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.980
The other one, the pursuit of certainty.

48:44.980 --> 48:50.440
And there are individuals who seem to speak as if mathematical science will still give

48:50.440 --> 48:51.560
us certainty.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.560
That's an illusion.

48:52.560 --> 48:58.200
Part of what we discover after Descartes, and Descartes was also surprised in that people

48:58.200 --> 49:07.720
ended up disagreeing with him, is that science doesn't and can't provide certainty.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.360
These two equations I put up on the board.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.440
This is from Einstein.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.280
This is from Newton.

49:14.280 --> 49:19.660
What Einstein showed is things that Newton thought were certain, absolute space and time,

49:19.660 --> 49:26.100
these kinds of formula, actually don't possess the certainty that Newton thought they did.

49:26.100 --> 49:36.220
We'll talk a little bit later about why we can't accept in very limited context.

49:36.220 --> 49:41.460
There are deep, deep reasons why we can't pursue certainty.

49:41.460 --> 49:50.120
And therefore we can't seek certainty as a solution to loss of connection, connection

49:50.120 --> 49:54.400
to our self, connection to the world, connection to other minds.

49:54.400 --> 50:00.680
Now, why does Descartes, again this radical irony, very similar to Luther, why does Descartes

50:00.680 --> 50:10.720
attempt to address this burgeoning loss of connections?

50:10.720 --> 50:17.300
What does it actually result in exactly the opposite, increased sense of disconnectedness?

50:17.300 --> 50:23.140
Part of it, of course, is the failure of the project of certainty.

50:23.140 --> 50:33.340
You can understand the 18th and the 19th, and especially the 20th centuries as scientific,

50:33.340 --> 50:40.280
historical, and philosophical undermining of the idea that we can achieve certainty.

50:40.280 --> 50:51.280
Of course, one of the great principles of modern physics is the uncertainty principle.

50:51.280 --> 50:52.280
But let's go back.

50:52.280 --> 51:00.800
So Descartes proposes that we should do this, but there's an individual at his time who's

51:00.800 --> 51:08.860
a contemporary of Descartes, who makes it explicit and radical, and then challenges

51:08.860 --> 51:13.500
Descartes with that radical derivation.

51:13.500 --> 51:21.900
Hobbes says, well, you know, all of this, what this means is that cognition is computation.

51:21.900 --> 51:26.180
Hobbes says that, he uses an older word, he says, rathiosination, what we would now say

51:26.180 --> 51:27.180
is cognition.

51:27.180 --> 51:29.780
By rathiosination I mean computation.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.680
Computation is computation.

51:31.680 --> 51:42.520
Now, there's a lot of people who were going to disagree with this model of computation.

51:42.520 --> 51:47.400
There's a lot of discussion right now, Brian Cantwell-Smith, a colleague of mine at the

51:47.400 --> 51:51.840
University of Toronto, does a lot of important work on the metaphysics of computation.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.200
I am not trying to state that this is the absolute truth about computation.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.080
That, of course, would be ironic, given what I just said about certainty.

51:58.100 --> 52:01.740
All I am arguing is, historically, this has been the interpretation of what computation

52:01.740 --> 52:04.340
was for people like Descartes and Hobbes.

52:04.340 --> 52:06.860
That's all we need for this argument.

52:06.860 --> 52:09.300
But Hobbes says, cognition is computation.

52:09.300 --> 52:12.300
And then here's the radical idea he proposes.

52:12.300 --> 52:19.660
He takes a new idea, current at the time, remember the idea that matter is a substance.

52:19.660 --> 52:25.780
Remember the old Aristotelian idea is matter is pure potential, but with Galileo, matter

52:25.800 --> 52:29.320
is a reality, right, in the sense of a substance.

52:29.320 --> 52:34.080
It resists, and it's good that it resists because I need something that resists my will

52:34.080 --> 52:36.800
in order to help me with my biases.

52:36.800 --> 52:43.960
So matter is inert, it's resistance, it's really there, I push on it.

52:43.960 --> 52:51.600
Notice that again, all that's left of conformity is resistance of will.

52:51.600 --> 53:12.220
Hobbes says, well, matter is real, and what if I built a material machine

53:12.220 --> 53:20.500
that did computation?

53:20.500 --> 53:26.120
If cognition is just computation, and I can build a machine that does computation, and

53:26.120 --> 53:30.960
some of the first automatic machines are being built at this time, calculating machines,

53:30.960 --> 53:38.920
if I can make a material machine that does computation, I will have made cognition.

53:38.920 --> 53:40.680
I will have made mine.

53:40.680 --> 53:48.320
Right there, at the heart of the scientific revolution, Hobbes is proposing artificial

53:48.320 --> 53:52.020
intelligence.

53:52.020 --> 54:07.740
Notice how artificial intelligence is a child of the advent of the meaning crisis and the

54:07.740 --> 54:08.900
scientific revolution.

54:08.900 --> 54:11.740
It's not a modern idea.

54:11.740 --> 54:16.100
Artificial intelligence goes back to this time.

54:16.480 --> 54:21.720
What is Hobbes doing with this?

54:21.720 --> 54:30.000
I said Galileo kills the universe and Copernicus kills the reality of our sense experience,

54:30.000 --> 54:36.960
but Hobbes is doing something way more personal because up till now, you've been isolated

54:36.960 --> 54:40.760
inside your own mind, but at least still there.

54:40.760 --> 54:46.080
I still have something special, unique, something spiritual.

54:46.100 --> 54:54.620
Hobbes kills the soul, no soul, because if artificial intelligence is right, if I can

54:54.620 --> 55:00.820
build a machine, purely material machine that is capable of computation, then I will have

55:00.820 --> 55:11.580
made a mind and I didn't have to involve any soul stuff, any spirit stuff in making it.

55:11.580 --> 55:13.580
And that's radical.

55:13.600 --> 55:20.360
Take a look at how Descartes responds to that and how deep that response is woven into our

55:20.360 --> 55:30.000
culture and the meaning crisis and how we move between AI and Descartes even today.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.360
Thank you very much for your time and attention.
