0	6640	Hello, everyone. The video you are about to see was originally recorded at the Utah 2024 conference.
7200	12960	It's a conversation, a panel discussion with Greg Enriquez, Alexander Bart and Benita Roy.
12960	20000	We get into some very deep discussions about transcendent naturalism and some convergences,
20000	24400	contrasts, and criticism. I hope you enjoy the video.
30960	37840	Alrighty, friends. First off, welcome. Good to see so many folks here.
41200	46480	I'm just saying my heart tickled to have an opportunity to have this conversation
48160	53120	with some of my very, very dear friends who have emerged in this space.
54080	61040	And of course, John, who will be joining us in a second, has been really tremendously influential.
61040	66240	It's been tremendously meaningful to connect with him. And I think since 2018,
66880	74400	Bart and I hooked up 2019 in the Intellectual Deep Web. And I got to say there are few people
74400	80480	in this world who are both more entertaining and more deep and more profound than John.
83120	88160	Alexander Bart, his Intellectual Deep Web is inspiring, his way of being in the world,
88160	92880	his vision across the breadth. Tyler Groke asked at the end of the last session,
92880	97520	well, is Utah really encompassed everybody? And I was like, well, not somebody like Bart.
99760	104480	Bart's are asked here on outside Utah, although I think they dance well together.
104480	108880	So Alexander Bart, thank you so much for being here. I really look forward to dialoguing.
109680	113200	And over the last couple of years, another dear friend of mine, Bonnie,
113840	118800	we have explored. I've started to learn, I'm still an amateur, but it's starting to really get a grip
118800	125200	on process ontology, on what true naturalism really means as opposed to the fake person that John
125200	132160	and I are doing. And I'm really looking forward to sharing about the layers of metaphysics
132160	140000	in relation. And so what we have today is then a very exciting exploration and discussion
140880	145760	where we're going to be talking about transcendent naturalism. John and I will be representing that.
146640	150880	Bonnie is going to bring her perspective, at least it sometimes is talked about,
150880	155440	that is fierce naturalism. I'm not sure if that's still the term that she is using. Yes.
156240	162560	And what that means. And then we have transcendent emergentism. And the title of our talk,
163440	168640	and I think me and John and Bonnie are okay with naturalism. We'll explore that. We're going to
168640	173520	get into what Bart feels about naturalism versus emergentism. And so we're going to be exploring
173520	179840	the relationships and excavating the fault lines in relationship to these two sets of perspectives.
180720	189360	And so here we are. If John's around, let me just see. Not sure if he's in yet or not in
189360	197840	relationship to that. I don't know. He's still not quite. Oh, there he is. Hey, John, wonderful.
197840	206320	Can you unmute yourself, friend? Can you unmute? Ask to unmute.
206320	213680	Now I'm on mute. There he is. Okay. Woo-hoo. I think we're all here then.
214560	221360	All right. So John, I just gave an overview introduction. Bonnie, Bart, Johnny and me,
221360	228960	I need to say that once. We're going to explore. So what we thought we'd do today,
229840	235760	in terms of basic order, is that John's going to kick us off talking, give us an outline of
235840	239440	transcendent naturalism. Of course, John and I did a series on that. I thought we had a lot of
239440	244320	excellent guests. We're going to wrap that series up with Lehmann Pascal and Bruce Alderman,
244320	251120	who obviously will bring lovely things to summarize that. So we're going to start with that.
251120	256720	Then Bonnie's going to give her take, explore a metaphysics that I think overlaps some,
256720	262480	but also potentially critiques. And then Bart will bring his perspective. The last thing I'll
262480	266960	say is, coming off of, obviously I mentioned last time, you talk emphasized the enlightenment
266960	273040	gap coming off natural sizes. I look around today, you've got materialism, idealism and dualism,
273040	279360	basically in the West. I think all of us would say, no, none of those are adequate. We need a new
279360	284720	framework, a new philosophical framework for the 21st century and beyond, and it's time to start
284720	293040	laying that down. So here we are. Let's get it rolling. John, if you would, take it away. I
293040	297760	introduced you already, then I already told you what a brother-in-arms you are, this process,
297760	301840	and how much I admire and respect you and your leadership. And that goes really for,
301840	306240	certainly, Agent Bard and Benito, and I should have that already. So welcome, my friend.
306800	312560	Thank you, Greg. And I'm looking forward to talking with you, Benita, and with you, Alexander.
313280	319200	So, Greg asked me to give an overview of the argument. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible
319200	328000	without leaving it with too many major gaps. I won't go over the argument in detail. I will
328000	333680	often just refer to arguments that were made in detail in the previous conference presentation
333680	338960	and on the series, Transcendent Naturalism. So Transcendent Naturalism comes out of two
338960	345280	proposals. It comes out of the proposal of extended naturalism, plus a proposal of a kind
345280	350400	of extended naturalism that supports strong transcendence, where that transcendence is
350400	356160	not just psychological in nature, but has real epistemological and ontological significance.
357200	362960	And there's two main arguments here. Each one is a meta-argument, a convergent argument,
363360	368880	a convergent argument for a properly-leveled ontology, and then a convergence argument for
368880	373760	a conformity theory of knowing. And then the proposal is, if you have a conformity theory of
373760	380560	knowing with a leveled ontology, you can actually afford a strong transcendence. I will add to that
380560	385840	something that I didn't make in the original talk, just a brief note on why that can be properly
385840	395200	understood as sacred. So extended naturalism is the proposal that science, let's take what
395200	401760	naturalism is standardly understood to mean, is that the natural sciences, that is where the
401760	408320	naturalism comes, are those projects that dictate to us our fundamental ontology, our fundamental
408320	414560	structural reality. Now that is usually interpreted without much justification as all of our ontology
414560	421920	has to be derivable from the ontology of the natural sciences. And I argue that that actually
421920	429360	doesn't make sense. You also have to include in naturalism everything that is presupposed
430000	435440	in order to do science. Your ontology needs to include that, or you actually have a blind spot
435440	441120	in your ontology. And that's the new book, by the way, by Evan Thompson, by Adam Frank,
442080	448960	sorry, an astrophysicist, Marcelo Gleiser, a theoretical physicist, and Evan Thompson,
448960	453920	a 4E cognitive scientist, and just some shameless self-promotion. The chapter on the blind spot
453920	459680	within cognition explicitly talks about Vervecchi's theory of relevance realization as the blind spot
459680	467520	within cognition. So yay, John. Okay, so anyways, the idea here is, if you do not include the
467520	472320	standpoint from which you are doing science, then you actually have an incomplete and therefore
472320	481040	incoherent ontology. And what I want to argue is, what does science actually presuppose? Well,
481040	488320	it presupposes scientists doing science. And how do we work that? How do we have to extend our
488320	494480	naturalism in order to include that? I take a look at three convergence arguments. One is from
494480	501920	Blackowitz on what he calls the real difference. He argues that reductionism is based on the premise
501920	507840	that only what is shared between things is ultimately real, that he argues can't be right.
508480	513760	Real differences matter. Real differences are presupposed by real information. If there's no
513760	520560	real information, there's no real intelligibility. And so you need real difference, which means
521360	529760	you have genuine emergence. The next main argument comes from whole. And this is the idea that
529760	539040	communication needs redundancy. Redundancy needs levels of reality to it. And causal signaling
539040	544320	is a form of communication. And therefore you need real emergence. Again, I'm not going to go over
544320	549600	these arguments in a way that is intended to make them persuasively convincing. I have done that in
549600	554720	the previous talk. We did that at the intro to transcendent naturalism. I am just referring to
554720	560080	them. You can go back and I'm going to take it that you're extending me the good faith,
560080	563440	that there are persuasive arguments for each one of these claims.
565440	571520	The third argument comes from the work of Yoraro, that science needs real structure.
571520	577040	And she makes a distinction between bottom up causes that change actuality and top down constraints
577040	582160	that shape possibility into potentiality. And science, of course, needs top down constraints.
582160	586880	These are things like E equals mc squared, which are not events. They are real constraints,
586880	593680	real structuring principles in reality. So so far, we need a leveled reality in order to get real
594480	599120	information, in order to get real causal signaling, in order to get real structure.
599760	604800	And then we have Smith's vertical causation argument, Volcker and Smith, which is the
604800	611200	argument to the effect that the measuring device cannot be at the same ontological level as what
611200	616480	is measured, especially when we come down to quantum entities. And so you need a real leveled
616480	622640	ontology in order for measurement. So notice what science presupposes real information,
622640	629120	real causal signaling, real structural principles. And it presupposes real measurement,
629920	634400	integrating all of those together, all of those presuppose a leveled ontology.
635680	639840	Vervecky makes a similar convergent argument that I made at Ralston at length,
641040	648880	which is in order for us to do science, we have to include the scientist on our ontology.
648880	655680	And that converges with everything I've just said. Why is it not just emergence up? The
655680	660400	problem with just emergence up, and this is not just my idea. Many people have talked about this,
660400	666000	is it gives you the level, the emergent level is epiphenomenal. It has no causal powers in its
666000	671120	own right, or no constraining powers in its own right. The problem with epiphenomenalism,
671120	677520	it's an oxymoronic term. It is a category for which we can find no non controversial members.
678080	684800	And it presuppose, it indicates that something exists, but does not make any difference in
684800	689360	reality and therefore is not knowable. I'm not going to go into that argument at length. I think
689360	696080	if your, if your ontology leads to epiphenomenalism, it is a modus tolens. You have led to a reductio
696080	702880	adipocertum. So you have to have real emanation and real emergence completely interpenetrating
702880	707840	each other. You have a continuum. And when we talk about levels, all we're doing is picking out
707840	713040	things that are particularly explanatorily, causally relevant. Whole has a formal proof
713040	718800	that each level has a distinct set of causal powers to it. And therefore, when we're talking
718800	723440	about levels, we're just picking out something that is most causally relevant to the particular
723440	729840	kind of explanation. But that is not that it is just an epistemic convenience. The levels are
730880	738960	epistemic conveniences that refer to a real emanation, emanation emergence continuum.
739760	746320	Now, what about the meta argument towards a conformity theory? So the opposite to conformity
746320	750000	theory is our current modern theory that knowledge is a matter of representation. I have something
750000	756640	in my head that represents the world. Pickstock in her astonishing book, Aspects of Truth and
756640	762720	New Religious Metaphysics from 2020 reviews all of the distinction arguments that are supposed
762720	768880	to support the proposal of representational knowledge and shows that within analytic philosophy,
768880	773920	itself, they have all been seriously undermined. The analytic synthetic distinction, of course,
773920	778480	has been undermined by Quine, the distinction between a conceptual scheme and its content,
778480	783520	by Davidson, the fact value distinction, and the is-ought distinction by Putnam,
784240	791280	Case Beer, or Verveke has one that relevance is both a cause and a reason. And the theory data
791280	795120	distinction by Quine and Duhem. So all of the distinctions that were supposed to
795920	801440	open up the space between mind and world for which representation with the bridge was the
801440	808240	bridge have been completely undermined. And what that returns you to is a conformity theory
808240	814560	that the mind and reality are co-participating in shared principles of individuation,
815280	823600	identification, intelligibility, and they're often mutually shaping each other
824320	828480	all the way from these construction up to cultural world views.
830160	836080	I also made an argument that cognition is all the cognitive sciences are converging on the idea
836080	843040	that cognition is a dynamic continuum of emergence up and top down, bottom up, top down,
843040	852400	completely into penetrating dynamically, realized processing. And if that was not tracking the
852400	857600	grammar of reality, if that grammar of cognition was not tracking the grammar of reality, we would
857600	863280	be facing a radical skepticism, a radical solipsism, because it would be that the mind in principle
863280	869520	could not know reality, and we'd be into very deep Kantian problems, and I won't reveal all the sort
869520	874880	of tensions and contradictions within the Kantian proposal. So we get a conformity theory.
876000	882320	And then that links up with independent arguments within 4e Cogsai, launched by Gibson about the
882480	887120	importance of affordances for perception and action and knowledge, Heidegger and the
887120	891760	all aesthetic notion of truth that is deeper than the coherence or correspondence notion of truth,
891760	896320	and Vervecchi's proposal that relevance realization is inherently transjective
896320	902560	and binds the subjective to the objective together and is therefore more real. And all of these
902560	909120	converge on a conformity theory of knowing. Now if you have a real leveled ontology and a conformity
909120	914720	theory of knowing by knowing it, I know I'm not only engaging in psychological improvement,
914720	922240	I'm actually knowing levels of reality that are otherwise inaccessible. And I am changing ontologically
922240	928480	to different levels of the self that correspond through participation. Actually, I want to
928480	933040	erase that sentence, levels of the self that participate with levels of reality.
933040	940400	And so that is strong transcendence. It is making a fundamental epistemological and ontological
940400	947760	difference, not just psychological hygiene and improvement. I would add to that the current
947760	953600	work integrating the work of filler, who argues that pure relationality has to be ultimate because
953600	960320	you can't get relations from Aristotelian substances. Of course, our science has pure
960320	964240	relationality at the bottom and at the top and scientists are seeking the relation
965120	971440	between the cosmological and the quantum. Nishita's argument that Aristotle's substance
971440	978160	metaphysics, a substance is not stuff. A substance are independently existing objects, things.
978160	983440	Aristotle's ontology, which we still fundamentally share, is that things are ultimately real and
983440	989200	that relations and processes emerge from it. And that is tracked by a subject predicate logic.
989200	994880	Nishita shows, you get Filler's argument that that doesn't work. Relationality is deeper than
995360	1002880	subject and predicate and deeper than substance and its properties. Nishita shows the Aristotelian
1002880	1008720	metaphysics is inherently contradictory because it depends on predication, which is of universals,
1008720	1013760	but its ontology claims that individual substances, individual things are most real.
1013760	1017600	And this is the problem of how can the universals ever know the particular? It bedevils
1018400	1023200	medieval philosophy until the Aristotelian framework collapses and you get nominalism,
1023200	1027680	the proposed and what they do, what they decide to do is keep the substance ontology,
1028720	1033200	individual things ultimately exist, but there are no real relations, no real patterns. They exist
1033200	1037760	only in the mind. That's nominalism. That of course gives you a dualism because the mind is a
1037760	1042320	fundamentally different kind of reality than reality. And then dualism gives you all the
1042320	1049280	disasters of the meaning crisis. These are all arguments for abandoning a substance ontology
1049280	1054880	and understanding that a no-thingness of pure relationality is what is ultimately real.
1055680	1062800	Finally, making use of the work of the atheist Canadian philosopher Schellingberg
1062800	1067760	about what do we mean by the sacred? He talks about the Tripoli transcendent and this lines up
1067760	1073120	now with transcendent naturalism. The sacred is that which is ontologically ultimate. And of
1073120	1080480	course, we can conform to and participate in the ultimacy of pure relationality. Neoplatonism and
1080480	1088880	Zen both talk about this. Sodorological, it can transform you by entering into this relationship.
1088880	1094480	Of course, you get fundamental transformation of human beings because you're engaging in strong
1094560	1101040	transcendence. It saves you, it liberates you, it frees you in epistemologically and ontologically
1101040	1107040	significant ways, not just psychologically. And it's axiological. It gives you a reciprocal
1107040	1112560	opening relationship as you get the ground of the self is opening up to the ground of reality.
1112560	1118400	And they are ultimately non logically identical because they are co-realizations,
1118400	1126160	co-participations in the dynamic realization of pure relationality. And that that reciprocal
1126160	1134560	opening gives you a capacity to fall in love and to involve the whole of the self without
1134560	1141280	in any way being self involved. And this is would be a touchstone for all other normative
1141920	1147200	evaluations. So it would be it would be axiologically transcendent. I can develop all
1147200	1153440	of those arguments in greater detail if needed. So transcendent naturalism puts us into a
1153440	1160080	participatory relationship with ontological ultimacy, sodorological ultimacy, axiological
1160080	1166640	ultimacy. And that means it is also sacred. So transcendent naturalism gives an account
1167280	1175120	of sacredness and ultimate reality that is nevertheless still consistent with naturalism.
1175680	1182320	But that naturalism has to be extended naturalism. That's the gist of the arguments and some
1182320	1186480	recent additions I have made to them. So thank you very much, everyone, for your time and attention.
1187760	1195360	Wonderful. Thank you so much. And so I think that's a brilliant and crisp summary of the core
1195360	1200800	tenets. Christian put it in the group and I mentioned that John and I have done the series.
1201360	1205760	It brings in a number of different thinkers. I'm not going to get into it now because I did a
1205760	1210800	review of you talk and certainly have raised some questions. But let's just say what John just laid
1210800	1217120	out is a ball from Roy Bashkar and say there's a philosophical under laboring, a richness,
1217120	1221920	and of course then extending into modern cognitive science that fits sort of with
1221920	1226960	you talk and sort of a lock and key. I am not a philosopher by training in relation. I got some
1226960	1233840	notions, but the ways in which you talk is structured as we've dialogued is fundamentally
1233840	1239760	consistent and I think affords certain kinds of elaborations on what John was talking about.
1239760	1243440	But I'm not going to get into that because we're really talking fundamentally about these different
1243440	1248960	positions. What I want to do now is turn the discussion over to Benita Roy so that she can
1248960	1255200	share her perspective on naturalism, what John offers, and what she brings to bear in relation.
1257760	1263760	Benita Roy, can you, you can unmute. There you go.
1264880	1266640	Woman's worst nightmare.
1270320	1274640	First I want to thank John and Greg and all their guests because I've watched many,
1274640	1283040	many hours of their transcendent naturalism series and I really like season two. I think
1283680	1288960	it was, you know, you designed it so there's a lot of shake ups and different ideas and stuff
1288960	1296400	coming in and I think you brought in the problem and showed that there's a real critical importance
1296400	1304720	to this, but also that it's not easy. I don't think any of us think it's easy. So I'm glad that
1304720	1313840	John ended with Axiology because for me, why does this all matter? I think where the rubber hits
1313840	1322880	the road is that if we could come up with a system that is transcendent naturalism that really helps
1322880	1329680	people close the gap between the is and the ought, I think that this would be its biggest
1329680	1336640	contribution as we struggle with science and the psyche and idealism and reductionism and stuff.
1336640	1341520	This is kind of like the path toward that, but I really think that the goal,
1343200	1347280	one of the huge goals would be the axiological goal.
1350880	1358000	I want to start with a quote and the quote is to remind us, I think we all can agree with this
1358000	1363360	quote, but we're here on line and we're going to do a lot of talking and use a lot of words,
1363360	1370720	but I just want to honor the fact that for me and I assume for you that this is a constraint
1370720	1377520	and that we're after something that's really personal and sacred to us and meaningful to us
1377520	1381840	personally at a deep level. And so the quotes from Warren Heidi and he writes,
1381840	1388560	how should one live? Not by painstakingly constructing a linguistic replica of a corner
1388560	1394720	of the cosmos and then running repeatable experiments and quantifying the results,
1394720	1400080	but by carefully reflecting on what we are and what living well means for us.
1400960	1407840	So I think the journey often looks like constructing a linguistic replica of the
1407840	1413520	corner of the cosmos. I think those are the tools that we use, but I just want to remind
1414160	1418400	us that I recognize in all of us that that certainly is not our goal.
1422240	1428400	I don't really have a model or a system or an argument to make. I want to introduce some tools
1428400	1440480	that I think are useful in this project. And one tool is metaphysics. And my definition of
1440480	1448160	metaphysics amongst many others is I think that the purpose of metaphysics is to distinguish
1448160	1459200	the true from the real. Now, we have to define those very precisely and there's many different
1459200	1465840	ways to define them. But the way I am meaning about that is kind of like what Baskar talked about,
1465840	1475600	science deals with the actual and not the real. And so for me, the true is what science can get at.
1476320	1485200	And I define science as the set of protocols that lead to actions, the set of protocols
1485200	1492000	that lead to outcomes predicted by theory. And so science is in a box, a methodological box,
1492000	1500000	it has a lot of constraints, and it can create true theories. But this is quite different from the
1500000	1505280	real. And I'll talk a little bit about more about that later. But I think that and these are words
1505280	1511440	you hear, you know, John, John is talking about real, the transcendent as dealing in the realm of
1511440	1517680	the real and not the realm of the actual as Baskar would say, or their or the true. So I think
1517680	1530400	that's an important tool to look at. I want to talk about stratified reality. And stratified
1530400	1536480	reality is what we do when we say there's information energy and matter and then mind and then mind to
1536480	1542480	and life and this and that. There's, you know, you go different cultures and different periods of human
1542480	1551600	history, and people would not have organized the ontological stack that way. And so I was
1551600	1561760	thinking this morning about where in our evolutionary history, pre human, did we still, we first
1562640	1570240	encounter this ability to create ontological stacks. I mean, chimpanzees aren't running around
1570240	1576160	creating ontological stacks, people are. But because I think I believe in the continuity
1576160	1583120	of the animal mind with the human mind, I'm thinking this morning, where, where can I find
1583120	1590240	the earliest template or the feeling sense of this kind of activity. And I thought about how
1590240	1598160	animals will reduce a complex puzzle into parts. They do this. And, and so these are different
1598160	1602640	steps of action. So I want you to think about what, you know, this is what John said,
1602640	1607680	what is the standpoint from which we are doing this? What is the standpoint from which we are
1607680	1616000	creating stratified reality? And so I want you to feel into this sense that, okay, it starts in our
1616000	1622400	pre evolutionary history and our animal nature of reducing, reducing is not the right word because
1622400	1628880	reduces like a bad word or, or separating or distinguishing or discerning a complex puzzle
1628880	1634960	into parts. As far as I can see, that's the first instant. And then this is what's fascinating.
1634960	1642800	This carries on with early man into toolmaking. And the fact that we can teach toolmaking through
1642800	1647280	a series of steps, and there's a series of parts. And then this starts this whole
1648240	1656720	evolutionary advantage, I think is what we are doing when we're, we're, is where it all started.
1656720	1663120	And then now I want to reflect on something and that is breaking into parts has always been a
1663120	1670720	protocol for problem solving and making. But only recently has it become a protocol for getting at
1670720	1678400	what is real, meaningful, or for moral choice. Now, I don't know what to make of that statement
1678400	1684560	because that was my insight this morning, driven by, you know, the, the energy of the
1684560	1694400	participation of this panel. But it's something to, it's something to think about. And maybe that's
1694400	1702480	a good thing because maybe we are this, we're doing a problem solving thing. But maybe, maybe
1702480	1710800	there's something that needs to be converted there. Okay. However, given that, I'm going to talk about
1711360	1718800	what people do when they do stratified reality. And there's something very interesting. There's
1719280	1728880	there's a tendency to make a mistake. And that is, if we say, let me just give you an example. So
1728880	1734080	if I say, what is pizza made of? Okay, and you can say, well, pizza is made of dough. And then I
1734080	1740480	say, what is dough made of? I mean, you say dough is made of wheat. This presents a simplistic and
1740560	1752560	reductive sense of what is going on. Because the pizza is made of dough, but all but made with
1753200	1758560	the people who, you know, proof the dough, the cook who's doing it and the oven that's cooking it
1758560	1766720	and the oven, and blah, blah, blah, all of this, the with the with is lost. The with are all these
1766720	1776000	verbs that don't survive the analysis. Okay, then we can say, well, what is dough made with dough made
1776000	1783760	is with made with wheat and the agricultural revolution, which is made with human evolution,
1783760	1791040	which is made made with the genealogy of the earth. And so one of the things that happens when we
1791040	1797360	ontological stack along categories is all the with is gone. And all and it's kind of like the
1797360	1803600	physicists that when they say, well, 97% of matter and energy, we can't get our hands on.
1804240	1811680	And so there's something about this enterprise of categorization, stratifying reality that loses
1811680	1817360	all the with. So that's the first thing I want to point out. And I only want to point out really
1817440	1826560	one other thing. And that is, if you notice, as you go down, here's pizza.
1827840	1834160	Here's dough. Here's pizza and a whole bunch of cooks and stuff in the and the fact that you
1834160	1841040	bought the flour. Okay. And then here's dough and dough is made with wheat. As I go down,
1841040	1850640	the systems that are left out become larger, not smaller. So Sabina Hobson Felder has this
1850640	1856000	strong critique against physics and so does Eric Weinstein. And it's part of it is this problem.
1856640	1862720	Because if by the time you get to matter, and then you get to sub atoms, and then you get to
1862800	1872000	subatomic particles, the Higgs boson is made with the whole scientific enterprise across all of human
1872000	1879440	history, and the politicians and the money. And she's recent Hassan Felder's recently come out
1879440	1884960	and said, there's a real problem with the scientific enterprise. And this problematizes
1884960	1892000	something like the Higgs boson. And so this sense that the lower you go down, the more is actually
1892000	1901920	has to be included to justify the simple thing you are saying exists in this category of reality.
1901920	1913440	So I just want to add those. I haven't put it together. And I'm hoping that bar is up for the
1913440	1918480	challenge. Thank you very much for your time. All right. Thank you so much, Benita. I took some notes.
1918480	1923120	So what we're going to do, certainly after I'm going to hand it over to Bart, he's going to offer
1923120	1928000	one thing I will say. I hope for our conversation is naturalism, emergentism,
1928000	1933040	contrast, maybe Barbara will bring that. I found a lot I resonated with and what Benita said,
1933040	1936480	some questions that I had. I look forward to jumping in those. But we're going to hand it off
1937680	1945600	to Alexander Bart and let us have it, Bart. I'm kind of shocked at how much we agree.
1945760	1954000	But I knew we would probably. But I think there's there's also a lot here in the nuance. And Benita
1954000	1958000	and I, I'm going to do the sales pitch right away. It's done because it's fucking working.
1958000	1963840	It's not profit, by the way, it's pros and it came out last year. And I realized I had to do
1963840	1967600	metaphysics when I wrote this six book of mine. I had to do it. I had to sit down and do metaphysics
1967600	1973120	because the way we did human history could not be explained unless we had, you know, an understanding
1973120	1976960	of how we do universal history. So I had to go down to the dirty work of actually going into
1976960	1981440	metaphysics for the book. Bonita and I had wonderful conversations this fall already. I really
1981440	1987440	look forward to continue those. So I'm here with Bonita against John and Greg's. You know,
1987440	1992400	it's Abba again. I'm Swedish. It's like Bjorn and Benny against Anne and Fred Magnetta. But it's like,
1993360	1997760	but we had wonderful conversations. She gets the book and I really appreciate Bonita. She gets the
1997760	2002400	book in the sense that I'm the son of Hegel and she's the daughter of Whitehead. You know,
2002480	2007760	and I've always found Hegel and Whitehead to be scaringly compatible with each other. Hegel being
2007760	2013520	still not understood in the Anglo-Saxon world, basically, because we were all blinded by the
2013520	2018080	enormous turn with the amount of account to the content turn it's called in contemporary philosophy.
2018080	2022080	But what happened was that only a few years later in Germany, there was another shock, at least
2022080	2026080	on our part with the content turn, which is the Hegelian turn. So I will return to Hegel and bring
2026080	2030800	that into the conversation because a lot of what John is asking for. And I totally agree.
2031680	2035920	We have to do this turn and get out of the metal crisis. But actually, the work was done
2036640	2041520	by Hegel and Nietzsche in the 19th century. It's precisely by reading Hegel and Nietzsche through
2041520	2046400	each other. I worked on this for 30 years. I think we can see that there was a turn here. There was
2046400	2052400	a turn away from dualism. The last dualism was, of course, a modern kind onto a modest worldview
2052400	2058320	where the obsession is with difference. Okay. So everything relates to everything else in the
2058320	2063440	universe. And I totally agree with John. Epiphenomalism is just the dead end because, obviously,
2063440	2068160	my thinking relates my physicality to it. It's just all the different things that
2068160	2075120	exist affect everything else. So what we did in the book, there were two things. One of them is that
2075120	2079440	we realized that three of the philosophical disciplines that I'm a philosopher, I'm not a
2079440	2084160	scientist. When I'm a scientist, I'm an economist, which I will totally leave out of this conversation.
2085040	2088960	The economist Alexander Barj, you don't get seen today. But I'm a philosopher and an artist. So
2088960	2094080	allow me to be, if possible, maybe we might need to hear even more of the philosopher. And then
2094080	2099680	Greg and John, who are fantastic scientists, can stay with the size. But my pointer is that we needed
2099680	2104640	to look at the philosophical disciplines themselves. So being tired of doing ontology, because I'll
2104640	2108640	actually find ontology to be quite easy. There's ontology and there's ontics. Essentially, that's
2108640	2112720	what happened after Kant. So then everything starts moving and everything is relational,
2112720	2117520	and that's Hegel. From Hegel, through Nietzsche, on to White Ted, and on to the last, we have
2117520	2121680	realized that everything is relational fundamentally. All this very difficult to think
2121680	2127360	relationalism, it's absolutely necessary. The object out there is a byproduct of the relation.
2127360	2131440	There are a lot that comes after the relation. So I think we all agree on that. But Hegel did
2131440	2135520	too. The thing is with Hegel, he stopped in his dialectical method. He just said that no,
2136080	2142320	there is no fixed point anywhere in the universe ever. There are no, there's no individual. I
2143280	2147440	am many different people. I was a different person yesterday than I am tomorrow. By the way,
2147440	2151680	I die all the time and I'm born all the time. Divigiality is the normal state of things for us
2151680	2156080	to be human. So this was already Hegel because with his dialectical method, there is no fixed
2156080	2159440	point. You must imagine that you live in the universe where you're not allowed to have fixed
2159440	2165120	point unless you know you're only having a fixed point to use it to then try to understand something.
2165120	2169600	So it's like you borrow into that fixed point and that's called negation in Hegel. So what we did
2169600	2176240	was that we took ontology, epistemology and phenomenology and threw them all into one big
2177680	2182320	big mess, which is what Hegel actually did. What he said was basically that ontology and
2182320	2188000	epistemology and phenomenology are in themselves all three, three relational siblings in the world
2188000	2192000	of philosophy. And he started doing ontology and epistemology at the same time, which is how
2192000	2196400	we overcame Kant because in Kant, they were separate. And suddenly with Hegel, it's just
2196400	2200640	like he cracks jokes at Kant all the time. He's just like, no, no, no, Kant. It's not like there's
2200640	2205120	a phenomenon there and there's a numinal there because actually you are engaged and involved
2205120	2210480	with the numinal. So we call it phenomenology, just to crack a joke about it. Hegel constructed
2210480	2216400	phenomenology. So the thing was that by doing this and calling it narratology, I think we
2216400	2220400	come down to something that we can agree on is basically very human. Because in Hegel,
2220400	2224320	there's a subject and there's a substance. And it's a sub-relationship to the substance,
2224320	2228800	which is what philosophy is all about. There's always human subjectivity constantly returning
2228800	2232480	in Hegel. And whenever you try to come up with anything without you being involved with the
2232480	2238880	world, Hegel says, no way. That's cheating. Back to you again, because you are involved as philosopher
2238880	2243600	or as partner of the philosopher or as you believe you are involved in the world and we are humans.
2244400	2251280	Philosophy is a human endeavor. So narratology enabled us to say that this is the trick with
2251280	2257440	dialectics. Always have a three. So if you want to spice up your sex life, bring a third person
2257440	2263280	into the bedroom. I highly recommend it. This is very Hegel. What Hegel does is that no, dialectics
2263280	2269200	is not the dichotomy in opposition between two points. Like if you are young, you must split
2269200	2273920	either the young or the young. And Taoists actually do that, Bonito probably agrees, by splitting on
2273920	2277600	the young side. Always take the masculine side to make the split there because men are so fucking
2277600	2281680	scared to get away, women are not. So you split on the side and say there's young and the young
2281680	2286400	within the young. And then the young is opposite the young. This is how Hegel works all the time.
2286400	2292640	So by using ontology and epistemology and phenomenology as three philosophical discourses
2292640	2298000	and then saying they're all three interconnected one another. And this is the Hegelian absolute.
2298000	2302800	The Hegelian absolute is to recognize that and to recognize there is no fixed point
2303360	2309920	and using vocabulary from the Greeks, we then say that there's a logos and there's a pathos and
2309920	2315440	there's a mythos. Human beings have three different ways of describing reality or describing the world
2315440	2319440	that makes sense of the world. They use a logos, use a mythos and use the pathos. And science,
2319440	2324400	of course, is on the side of logos fundamentally. Pathos is just our emotional lives, our feelings
2324400	2328560	and blah, blah, blah. There's no such thing in AI, by the way, electricity is not blood.
2328560	2332240	Put it that way. The pathos is incredibly human, animalistic, whatever, you know,
2332240	2336320	all the forces inside of you, the force of nature, pathic, pathical narratives,
2336880	2341440	you know, news, a cast, pornography, anything that's brutally real thrown at you is a pathical
2341440	2346480	narrative. And then there's mythos and mythos is actually as often Hegel to go between,
2346480	2351280	meaning that since logos and pathos can never be unified in themselves as logos or pathos,
2351280	2359120	you have to invent a mythos. And this is the temporary story about ourselves that human beings
2359920	2365120	have to create all the time to make sense of the world. So Hegel allows us to have a temporary
2365120	2370000	platform, which we agree, at least now we can agree, we have a paradigm, we have a certain
2370000	2375040	historical period, we agree on certain values, we create a society together and off we go, right?
2375040	2379600	So to create that temporary platform, the mythos about ourselves currently in the digital age
2379600	2384400	with AI arriving and climate change and everything to arrive at a mythos is what we need. The meta
2384400	2389520	crisis is a lack of a new mythos. It's a nihilistic state where the old mythos is dead.
2390320	2394560	It's it's not a death of a God, it's a death of a paradigm and a new paradigm has to be
2394560	2400160	stored and we're in between paradigms for the most. Okay, so this moves us on to metaphysics.
2400160	2405200	So what kind of what kind of implications does this neurological model have for metaphysics?
2405840	2412000	What it means that like you guys, the three of you here, I hate reductionism, reductionism,
2412000	2417280	most silliest thing ever. Bonita just pointed out perfectly so simply by reducing the pizza to
2417280	2422400	the wheat is idiocy, right? The problem is that I don't know why, but especially the computer
2422400	2426880	scientists to make all the technology they are all reductionist and they tend to go to either
2426880	2431600	reduction down to the so sort of simplest monad which where apparently the entire history of
2431600	2436000	the universe is preprogrammed or something. They go all the way down to reduce everything down to
2436000	2439680	some kind of atom, which would then explain everything else that happens afterwards because
2439680	2444800	everything is then deterministic from that point, which I totally disagree with. But they also go
2444800	2448800	the other way and said, well, I'm conscious and there's consciousness is in some center of the
2448800	2452560	universe. And I'm a fucking narcissist. And because I'm a computer scientist, just made
2452560	2457680	billions of dollars. Therefore, everything has to be about me. So everything can be reduced
2457680	2462640	to a consciousness. All I tell those guys is that here is a rock, go and cuddle with a rock,
2462640	2465920	have sex with the rock and talk to the rock, not with me apparently because the rock has
2465920	2471520	consciousness and you can talk to it, right? And off they go. So reductionism is the enemy,
2471520	2476080	but it's being this difficult to get rid of reductionism. I know all you guys here in the
2476080	2480560	thread say, oh, relations, yes, of course, relations prior to a lot of our own relations,
2480560	2485360	you have no idea of difficulties to actually sit down and try to do relationalist philosophy.
2485440	2490640	This is why two geniuses like Hegel and Nietzsche and White Ted to do it. And it's really,
2490640	2497280	really hard. But okay, but if you try to do it, you got to remove all those things out there
2497280	2502960	where you lose track. So what I'm proposing is that I'm sorry, but the word nature is just
2502960	2508480	the opposite of culture. And I'm defiant here. Nature is not superior to culture.
2509360	2515040	The just different emerges as nature emerged and culture emerged. And like Greg probably
2515040	2519680	graced me, they're equal. If you're going to do metaphysics, don't do don't do axiology,
2519680	2523520	we do metaphysics, leave axiology, you can do that later. It can be its own fourth story,
2523520	2527280	whatever, leave axiology, just try to be as neutral as you can, try to describe how the
2527280	2531280	world functions. That's all you try to do here philosophically. That's metaphysics. So you say,
2531280	2538880	okay, so where do I start them? Well, here's the great thing, Bergson. Bergson said, why is everybody
2538880	2543360	obsessed with why there's something rather nothing? Because that's just interchangeable,
2543360	2546720	like you were nothing, then you were born, you were something and then you die, you're nothing
2546720	2551120	again. There's something and nothing all the time. That wasn't even a philosophical question,
2551120	2557440	this like betrugation. And then Bergson said, what really strikes me with reality and with
2557440	2562720	the university is how much difference there is. God, there's so much difference and difference
2562720	2566240	and difference upon difference and difference between differences and differences and differences
2566240	2572320	all the time, which is relations. Relationship is obsession with difference. And I'm obsessed with it.
2572320	2578400	So I start my philosophy right here and now with you guys. And then I said, what philosophy is
2578400	2585440	concerned with, what metaphysics is concerned with is that shit happens. And then the question is,
2585440	2588960	what is shit? What kinds of shit are there? And what does it mean that something happens?
2590320	2595360	Okay, then there's a great word for that, which is emergence. And we can then locate
2595360	2599840	emergence as we temporarily say, emergence is like the most important happening that ever happened
2599840	2604560	to us. So we sit here and describe the world of the 21st century. What is the most important thing
2604560	2608480	that ever happened to us? And this is where Greg got some of the ideas from and Greg and I started
2608480	2612400	into changing, you know, knowledge with each other a few years ago, is that it makes sense
2612400	2616400	then to create these different emerges that have happened. Well, apparently, some kind of big
2616400	2622000	bounce or big bang, whatever happened. And physics came out of that. And we have chemistry and we
2622000	2627040	have biology. And biology and physics is a hard problem to begin with. You don't need to mind
2627040	2631360	a matter to have a hard problem. The hard problem is everywhere. Because if one thing is irreducible
2631360	2635120	to something else, probably the problem is hard just because you're using the wrong language.
2635760	2638800	If you use the language of biology, try to describe physics, you're going to go dead wrong.
2638800	2642320	If you use the language of physics, try to describe biology, it won't work. So biology is
2642320	2646480	just a different emergence vector compared to physics and different emerges vector. I even
2646480	2650960	allow chemistry one as well. And then we would always say mind. And as Greg says, the mind has
2650960	2655840	produced culture and culture is radically different from all the natures we had in the past. So we
2655920	2660320	have a cultural emergence vector. So when we look at the world, we have these different
2660320	2667120	emergence vectors. And then we could start make sense of each one of them independently by refusing
2667120	2672880	to reduce any one of them to the other ones. Can you see how flat this becomes? So it's an
2672880	2678640	emergentism to begin with. So this emergentism. Now here's the problem though. Something could
2678640	2683600	happen. You know, shit happens. Something could happen that forces us to rethink how we look at
2683600	2689120	the world. It's happened in the past quite a few times. It seems even like every time a new paradigm
2689120	2693040	comes right now, the internet came and took over the world. And we had satellites everywhere,
2693040	2696240	we're all interconnected with each other and AI comes along. And of course we start seeing
2696240	2700880	networks everywhere. And then we live in a network dynamical world all of a sudden. And then of
2700880	2705760	course we say, well, everything is religious. Yeah, because to us now here, network dynamical
2705760	2709200	universe to make sense of this, for me sitting here is waiting talking to you guys like we're
2709200	2715040	in the same room. Magic. Yesterday's magic is tomorrow's technology. Magic. Okay. So the world
2715040	2720160	changes. And our world, you have to change with it. And we're only human. That means the emergentism
2720160	2728480	has to be transcendental. And here's the trick. It is so, so easy by human mind, which is stuck
2728480	2733360	with reductionism to try to find rules and patterns for emergencies. Say that, well,
2733360	2738320	an emergency is objectively when this thing's happened that it's an emergency. And then Hegel
2738320	2745520	and I just said, no way, no way, baby, you can't do that. Because if an emergency occurs, it wasn't
2745520	2753520	pre-programmed. There was no creator God that dictated beforehand what constitutes an emergency.
2753520	2760080	It's like Hegel says, it's only in his side that we human beings construct the necessity of the past
2760080	2767360	and say that because now with what we know now, that was an emergency, but that was not. Okay.
2767360	2773920	That means the number one rule for transcendental emergentism is that it disqualifies any general
2773920	2780640	emergency theory. There's no general concept to what an emergency is beforehand. What happens is
2780640	2786880	that when a certain emergence happens, the entire theory has to be thrown out and reconstructed as
2786880	2792480	a new transcendental emergent system. And that is the transcendentality. It's allowing us to
2792480	2796800	completely change everything. Or like I say, when people say they don't believe in God, well,
2796800	2803680	haven't waited long enough yet, meaning God could come. Looking at AIs, getting scared like God,
2803680	2808800	and we might need God because we haven't mentored the devil. We did August 6, 1945, we blow up a
2808800	2813600	bomb over Oshima, the devil very much exists, and we went to the devil. So we have to do theology
2813600	2818560	again and understand we didn't ment the devil. Where is God to save us from the devil? Right?
2818560	2822880	Now, if you do that, if you start to think about the word like that, there's incredible freedom
2822880	2828960	in going for a transcendental emergency perspective. And why I use the word emergency rather than nature
2828960	2834160	is because it's a purely metaphysical theory. Greg and John are doing science metaphysics
2834160	2838240	for science. I respect that. But if you do a purely metaphysical theory, it's better to work
2838320	2843440	with the emergency because it's absolutely neutral. It just says that shit happens.
2844080	2849600	It says nothing else. It doesn't say nature. It doesn't say culture. And it says that if an
2849600	2854640	emergency happens, and we in hindsight, we live in the 21st century will agree on that these things
2854640	2858560	are the most important things that ever happen in history. And then we can start looking at these
2858560	2861600	are the most important things that ever happen in human history, because in the same last
2861600	2865520	historical season, these dramatic events to change history forever, and we know how to live
2865520	2870800	with the consequence of that. Hiroshima being one of them. Okay, that's an emergency. Transcendent
2870800	2874560	emergentism applied on human history, and then we can start understanding society.
2874560	2878640	So that's essentially how you do metaphysics. If you're a little philosopher like me, I guess.
2880560	2887680	All right. Thank you. Each of you. I think we've gotten a very good summary of the various
2887680	2894960	perspectives. I'll just put a let me let me put a little Utah spin. Then I'll invite John
2895520	2900640	Benita and Bart to just talk amongst themselves. Certainly if I have there are a lot I want to
2900640	2906720	say, but I really want the three of you guys to have some dialogue. I want to remind folks,
2906720	2914080	since we're here in Utah land for the conference, that Utah is situated in a particular kind of
2914080	2919520	problem. And that is what I mentioned earlier in terms of like Bart is coming from a different place.
2920320	2926000	It is very important to understand the situation of Utah. And that's crucial to understand both
2926000	2932880	its power and its limitations. It is structured to solve or it emerges out of a very particular
2932880	2938640	kind of justificatory problem, which presupposes the natural sciences and the kind of knowledge
2938640	2943440	they're trying to generate. And how does it then relate to psychology as both the science and the
2943440	2950800	subject? And the Utah architecture is concerned with that and it emerges as a naturalism as a
2950800	2956720	function of that. That does not necessarily say that, oh, that is where everyone should be situated
2956720	2961200	or a philosopher that takes a pure proper metaphysical stance should be situated there.
2961840	2966320	So I'll just say that in relationship to the Utah stance. So I can hang with Bart and basically be
2966320	2970560	like, oh, there's a different framing that we should be aware of. And if we have those framings,
2970560	2974400	I think there's a lot of participatory dance that can be effectively take place.
2975200	2980960	So I'll offer that. And it's a very similar comment in relationship to Benita. And really,
2980960	2985760	actually, then there's the synergy with John's view in particular. And I think that is a function
2985760	2990800	of being psychologists, cognitive science, et cetera. So I'll offer that sort of as a synergistic,
2990800	2997120	but I also want to get into some disagreements. I have some questions for both Bonnie and Bart,
2997120	3002400	but I'm going to pause. I'm going to hand it back to John and see where you want to take it,
3002400	3006400	John. And then we can just go in some dialogue amongst the four of us and then start really
3006400	3014960	bringing in some questions. Yeah, John, go ahead. I think, yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you.
3017360	3022320	First of all, that was really rich and wonderful. I really welcome Alexander's. Everybody seems to
3022320	3030080	be calling him Bard. Is that what you want? It's okay. Sometimes sub-Bard, but then it will.
3030080	3036000	It makes me feel in high school. Teenage boys often use last names as opposed to first names,
3036000	3042320	so at least in Canada. I don't know why we do that. First of all, I'm very happy to get into
3042320	3047680	a discussion with Hegel. I've been doing, as you probably know, Bart, there's a renaissance about
3047680	3055600	Hegel going on, and the work of Brandum, the work of Pinkard, the work of Farnath,
3056640	3059920	Zambroga, all these people. I'm going through all of that literature. I'm going through it very
3059920	3066960	carefully with Dan Ciappi, especially Hegel's binding of the notion of rationality into
3066960	3073280	reciprocal recognition between individuals, not only synchronically, but intergenerationally.
3074000	3079120	I think that maps, by the way, very powerfully into current work on extended cognition,
3079120	3085920	collective intelligence, things like that. You always need to ask, where's the agent that's
3085920	3091360	doing the cognition? I think Hegel gives us an alternative agency. He famously talks about
3091360	3097200	the I that is we that is I, and that's the kind of agency that is doing this more fundamental
3097200	3103120	ontology. I think in that sense, I'm in fundamental agreement with you, and then trying to work out
3103200	3110720	how does that agency operate? I won't get into the details about that. I think that is a very
3110720	3117040	significant problem. It's a problem that is now becoming central to Foricog Psi. Hegel is coming
3117040	3123280	in in a very big way. I think in that sense, we're in agreement. I'll speak about Whitehead
3123280	3131440	in a second, and then I'll return to Benita. I do have an issue with Hegel, and I think this
3131440	3137440	comes out very clearly in Pinkard. Hegel talks a lot about the sociocultural, cultural, historical
3137440	3144400	processes that make the kind of persons, the kind of agents. We need all of these practices,
3144400	3150640	as he repeatedly says, that makes us into the kind of cognitive agents that can recognize
3151760	3157440	the inconsistencies within a particular way of life, a particular form of life. And of course,
3157440	3164560	the phenomenology tries to trace both that out. The problem I have is I fear that at times Hegel
3164560	3170800	verges on a performative contradiction. He is using the propositional to try to point to the
3170800	3177120	non-propositional. He doesn't really give us a theory of practices or an ecology of practice,
3178160	3182720	and that can't be just propositional. You, of course, have to use language, but you have to
3182720	3187200	actually engage people non-propositionally. That is the way in which they learn practices.
3187200	3192960	And I would put to Benita, I think she's right. We don't ultimately get at reality through
3192960	3199600	truth statements. We get at reality through processes, practices of realization. And that's
3199600	3207040	where I would bring in what Benita is talking about. I totally agree. We need ecologies of
3207040	3215040	practices because realization is how we get conformed to reality as distinct from truth.
3216480	3223520	And then the issue then comes up. Okay, well, what does that look like? And I think this takes us
3223520	3227920	into some work that's going on now about some of the work I'm doing about the deep at the heart of
3227920	3233760	the rational. And I think this is already presaged in Hegel. You find ritual. You find rituals of
3233760	3239680	recognition and forgiveness. And you find the generation of the spirit of trust. Barnett does
3239680	3245040	that very well. And you have additional arguments for why at the heart of the rational, we find
3245040	3251440	ritual, we have to use all these imaginal things. Look, simple one example of many. To be rational,
3251440	3256640	I have to reflect on my own cognition. Oh, well, where do I do? Well, I go into this interior space.
3256640	3262160	Was that a literal space? No. Is it a merely fictional space? No, it gives you access to your
3262160	3267680	cognition so you can correct it. It's but it's neither fictional nor literal. Well, what is it?
3267680	3272640	It's imaginal. And you and you're engaging in ritual because you're seriously playing within
3272640	3278000	an imaginal rain, rain realm, I should say, in order to bring about the fundamental kinds of
3278000	3284480	transformation in metacognition that is constitutive of rationality. So at the heart of the rational
3284480	3290400	is the rich is ritual. But that doesn't mean that ritual is irrational. Ritual has a non
3290400	3296880	propositional rationality. It's not the rationality of coherence. It's the rationality of does your
3296880	3301680	is what you're doing in your ritual context. Does it transfer systematically? Does it transfer
3301680	3308160	broadly and deeply to many domains of your life? And does it transform you profoundly? Does it reach
3308160	3314160	into many levels of the psyche and transform those that when when you get systematic transfer and
3314160	3319120	systemic transformation, that's why rituals survive. That is how they survive. That's their
3319200	3324000	rationality. That is what we that's that's how we judge a good ritual from a bad rich will.
3324000	3328960	So you find the ritual and the rational rational mutually profoundly interpenetrating
3328960	3333520	each other. And for me, that's the where the work of the Kyoto school, especially Nishita,
3333520	3340400	is so important because Nishita develops, you know, he follows the Zen ritual into the experience,
3340400	3346240	the experience, not to put that in serious quotations of nothingness. And then he does explicitly,
3346240	3351840	by the way, a neoplatonic investigation into the grounds of intelligibility. And he gets to the
3351840	3359280	basho. And he shows that the basho and the the Zen experience of nothingness are completely
3359280	3363840	interdependent and inter reliant. And you get basically Zen, no Platonism.
3364960	3370640	About Whitehead, I think I was just at the McGillchrist conference at the California Institute
3371360	3376560	for Integral Studies. And of course, you know, and Ian and I agree on, you know, the right hemisphere
3378000	3382640	is about the Gestalt and the left hemisphere is about the features. And I can give you all the
3382640	3385760	features of the bird that doesn't give you a bird. You need the Gestalt. That's where the
3385760	3390400	intelligibility actually hangs. And that's pure relationality. The right, that's what the right
3390400	3396080	hemisphere is about. I'll just plug in real fast, John. Matt Siegel wanted to be here. He's actually
3396080	3399520	at a conference. He sends love. And of course, we've talked to him and talked with him, Bonnie.
3400080	3403840	And he's an excellent process philosopher. I'll just make that nod as you mentioned.
3403840	3410640	Yeah. And I just want to finish very quickly. I don't want to monopolize. And then the thing
3410640	3416960	there, of course, is the left hemisphere works with parts within a formal system and well-defined
3416960	3422400	problems. Just getting a paper published now showing that you can't computationalize
3423360	3431120	relevance realization because the process of formalization, the process of translating things
3431120	3438160	into a formal system is not itself a well-defined problem. And it can't therefore be grasped by
3438160	3445360	a formal system. Formalization is not a computational function. It is no way of running a formal system.
3445360	3451280	And so you get that the right hemisphere has priority. And the right hemisphere is about
3451360	3457360	pure relationality. And Ian and I fundamentally agree on that. The reason I bring that up is
3457360	3462800	in Fuller in his astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being,
3463920	3468640	makes the argument. And Matt Siegel and the other people, the Whiteheadians agreed that
3469920	3474800	Whitehead is basically running an argument that was developed by the later Neoplatonist
3475680	3480800	about pure relationality, about emergence and emanation. What Whitehead adds that I think
3480800	3487760	James, I know Fuller personally, what James misses is that process of that, I think both of you are
3487760	3494560	putting your finger on, which is the radical creativity. And I think that's what Bard wanted
3494560	3502240	to point out too. Whitehead, the many become one and then one is added. That drawing together
3502320	3509520	of all the widths isn't just a stagnant interrelationality. It's pregnant. It creates
3509520	3515840	a newness, a novelty. And what I want to add to that is that that means we have to introduce
3515840	3523680	into our ontology radical uncertainty. If you have radical emergence in which you can't predict
3523680	3531440	the emergence, but there is some novelty introduced, you are facing radical uncertainty,
3531440	3538400	which means by definition, no formal system can ultimately track reality because formal
3538400	3545120	systems require the exclusion of uncertainty. So if there really is radical creativity,
3545120	3549360	which is what I think Whitehead adds to the Neoplatonist, and I think what Bard is pointing
3549360	3556080	to, we face an ontology in which uncertainty is not just an epistemic matter. It's not
3556080	3563440	equivalent to probabilistic risk that we can calculate. It is radical uncertainty, which then
3563440	3570880	means we cannot grasp it with a formal system. And I think that's the convergent with what
3570880	3580480	Bard is was saying. And I think that's also part of picking up on what Benita was, I think, pointing
3580480	3596560	to. And I'll end my responses there. There's 17,000 more things I want to say. But I was interested
3596560	3607200	in also, I think sacredness is the bridging notion between the ultimacy of ontology and the
3607200	3612960	ultimacy of axiology. The sacred is that which is most valuable, but it is also bound to what is
3612960	3618400	most real. And I was trying to make an argument that if you get to this ultimate reality, you
3618400	3625760	have the triple transcendent, which gives you sacredness. And I think if you have sacredness
3626640	3633040	with unformalizability that is captured, realized, I should say, not captured, wrong word,
3633040	3640640	that is realized in a set of practices, I think you're very much into what religion was doing for
3640640	3650640	us. And that would be my response. Lovely. Okay, so how about I hand it over to Benita and see
3650640	3655280	what thoughts she wants to pick up on them? We'll really open it up, folks. You can use a question
3655280	3662720	and answer chat. I see one in there already. I'll also check the chat box for this. And I know
3662800	3666720	we'll come in, but I want to give Benita and Bard an opportunity to respond to that. You guys
3666720	3672400	certainly ask each other questions as well. And I'll be checking the Q&A as well. So Benita, thoughts?
3673360	3680960	This is so be kind. And so as John said, there's a million things to go through. I want to say
3680960	3686800	this may be a little bit of plug, but I am on the last panel and we'll have a chance to talk about
3687440	3694800	my conception of God. So I'm going to leave that part out. Although it would be nice to just
3694800	3699920	put that here. And I want to talk about what I think. First of all, I have to say this because I
3699920	3708560	have to kind of tease Alexander Bard. Okay, so Bruno Moutour wrote this book, Speculative Grace.
3709200	3717440	And it really sounds very much like you creating religion with a flat ontology.
3719520	3726080	And I just think only a true genius like Bard could use Hegel as an icon for a flat ontology.
3727680	3736640	Yeah, so that was genius. So brilliant. But I guess what I want to do is kind of
3738720	3747280	perform what I think Whitehead is doing. And that is everything we said about the difference
3747280	3753440	between the true and real. So that's the bird chair. And then he says, so then what do I have?
3754160	3763280	What do I have to experience reality? And basically what he boils it down to is I have
3763440	3769360	what the Buddhists would call self validating experience of the real. And this is a feeling,
3770080	3776720	that the most fundamental way I can express what this experience is, is a feeling that things are
3776720	3788080	real. And so from this, he says, as I interpret him, as in my fantasy of being with Whitehead,
3788880	3796080	he then says, well, if this is, so instead of having like a metaphysical ground, this is what
3796080	3803360	I truly believe is the most fundamental thing I can say about myself. And then he makes his leap.
3803360	3810960	This is the metaphysical leap. Maybe all of reality works on this template. What if all of
3810960	3817760	reality, maybe it's not just a coincidence that my experience is that this self validating feeling
3817760	3825520	that something is real. And in this feeling itself validates two things. And this is where the
3825520	3832800	transcendent comes in. It validates that my experience is real and replete. It is whole and
3832800	3841680	full. But it also validates that it's not complete. That there's a remainder in the cosmos. And this
3841760	3851680	creates the sense that there is more reality. So this is extremely important experience. And
3851680	3858160	I believe this is the kind of experience that sustained Whitehead's work. I've never read
3858160	3864880	a biography of him, but that it brings true to me. And I just want to combine this with something
3864960	3874160	that Diana Fascia says. She's a student of Panseps. And she talks about the clinical
3875440	3883440	experience of transformants, that the psychology, the psychologist and the client are working
3883440	3890960	toward this, what she calls, she says, it's an evolutionary arc that's deeply wired in humans
3890960	3899120	for transformants. And that truth in this sense, which is reality, is this trust or comes from
3899120	3906720	the word trough or trust. It's this inner understanding of clarity that is the marker for
3906720	3915440	awakening of perception. It emerges from awakened perception as a core truth or trust to trust
3915440	3923760	to truth is to behold. And so I think that these kinds of languages, these kinds of
3924880	3939760	confidence in the human experience is a potential point at which we can begin to
3939760	3954880	investigate and share and sing and celebrate the confidence of the real and share this peculiar
3954880	3961680	sense that the real is always never complete. And there's always a latency in our experience. So
3962640	3968960	yeah, that's what I'd like to put in the space. That's awesome. I did not expect Diana Fascia to
3968960	3976320	pop up. I'm a fan of hers, AEDT, and that's Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Approaches.
3976880	3984080	And it is absolutely the case that modern, emotion focused elements, gestalt frameworks,
3984640	3989600	to me, the word that I would definitely want us to hit here is primate mindedness.
3991440	3996640	The mind, the idea that the mind is a propositional reflector that's going to represent,
3996720	4003840	and that's what's split off, is one of the deep errors of the Enlightenment. Mindedness is the
4003840	4010560	embodied contact. And clinically, what we see so much of is a disconnect, a fundamental propositional
4010560	4016080	disconnect. You can argue, certainly you, McGill, because John, and saying modern society in part
4016080	4022640	is propositionally personhood disconnected from the primate embodiedness. And so much of what
4022640	4028480	we do clinically is attempt to connect to that in a relational space that creates a shared,
4028480	4035040	non-propositional, intersubjected, I'd call it a mind-to-be space, to connect to the real.
4036000	4041920	And it's so lovely to see that bridge happen in terms of me as a clinician. That's sort of an
4041920	4046320	unexpected turn, so I just had to prop in there. Let me hand it over to Bard, and then we'll really
4046400	4051840	start to let's, you know, engage in question and answer from the audience and whatnot.
4051840	4056640	So, there's two quick responses to Bonita and Greg, because we've been in a lot of conversations,
4056640	4062960	and we'll be at that. This is whited at his Hegelian vest. And please remember, I use Hegel for
4062960	4067360	method. Hegel was wrong on many things. John can be short of that. He was wrong on many things,
4067360	4072400	but he was brilliant when it comes to method, because with Hegelian dialectics, we arrive in
4072400	4079360	Western philosophy with a complete set of how to think relationalism. And whited just does the
4079360	4084480	same thing. And that remainder, that's exactly the negation within the subject in Hegel. So,
4084480	4091120	you have those things there. So, perfect, Bonita. And as for you, Greg, this is why I am as a
4091120	4096480	psych analyst, I am fighting to get psych analysis out of the ditch of science, because as a science
4096480	4101520	psych analysis failed miserably in 20th century, but it took off and became a philosophical
4101520	4108080	discipline. And as a philosophical discipline, the 20th century was, it was anthropology became
4108080	4113600	philosophy. It was psych analysis became philosophy. And most of all, you know, to do Hegel, I had to
4113600	4119200	do Marshall McLuhan first, because there's no media theory in Hegel. Hegel thinks ideas develop
4119200	4123360	over time. No, they don't. What develops is, of course, again, relations between human beings
4123360	4126800	and different technologies. And because different technologies develop over time,
4126800	4130800	they change the life world we're in. And we actually take to take, we tend to take to the
4130800	4134960	technologies and proven our lives run the ones to make our miserable. And because we do that,
4134960	4139520	we can then expand it to learn how to read, write, count, and we can mass duplicate new kinds of
4139520	4143600	amazing things we do. And that's exactly why I think Hegel is only method and nothing else.
4143600	4147200	Leave Hegel for the rest. That's exactly why Marx and Darwin, the other guys who came after
4147200	4153200	Hegel, all went to the material real world and threw it at Hegel with the dialectical method.
4153200	4158640	But the method is great. So I, this is why I'm a great fan of Greg and where I'm involved with
4158640	4166080	the Utah, okay, Utah, is it called Utah? Utah. Utah is great. Utah, because I really believe
4166080	4170960	psychology needs a reformation. It needs a massive reformation. They get stuck as a service to
4170960	4175600	governments, basically to fix people to send them back to work over the past 50 to 100 years.
4175600	4178800	And what I loved about Greg's passion was the fact that he said, I'm a psychologist,
4178800	4182560	I'm going to take psychology seriously. I'm going to, I'm going to do what Aristotle
4182560	4188320	meant with psycho and logos and do real psychology. And this is exactly why I totally support the
4188320	4193440	attempt to do a proper psychology as a science, which of course then connects to John's work
4193440	4198480	as a cognitive scientist. These are great scientists, scientists, we need more of them.
4198480	4204800	Okay. So for me to do psych analysis is now to do strictly an art. It's nothing but an art.
4204800	4209680	It's a philosophical art. For me, psychoanalysis performing through people is basically taking
4209680	4213680	the entire history of philosophy down to one single human being and then put their
4213680	4218880	divigiality into philosophical perspective. It's teaching people how to do a philosophy
4218880	4224720	about themselves. That's a cycle of it. So psychoanalysis, I work today with psychiatry,
4224720	4228880	and I work today with psychologists. What I do is I arrange teams here at Stockholm
4228880	4232320	where there's psychologists, there's psychiatrists, and there's a psychoanalyst.
4232320	4236400	And there are three different perspectives looking at human beings and it's stunning
4236400	4241200	how quickly we can get to results and solve problems and give people a quality of life
4241200	4245200	and heal, right? So, so I'm all for this. Again,
4245200	4248880	narratology, like I told you, when you have a dialectical relation between three things,
4248880	4252880	it's usually very, very productive. Don't try to unify them into one thing.
4252880	4257600	Don't try to turn logos, pathos and mythos into one thing. Keep them separate, live with the
4257600	4260800	dichotomies. This is Hegel, live the dichotomies and it's going to be productive and it's going
4260880	4266800	to be great. Okay. Now, now I want to respond to John, because I'm just going to write a word
4266800	4270080	down here in the chat channel. I'm going to put my glasses on and write it down,
4270080	4273920	because this is the next project I'm involved with and I'm thrilled about. It's probably my
4273920	4280880	seventh book and everything else I'm doing. Zoophism with a Z. So here's the take. When I
4280880	4284480	started traveling to Asia in the 1980s and realized the religion and philosophy had to
4284480	4289120	meet again and Eastern spirituality was amazing. And I was totally with Ken Wilber that it would
4289120	4293440	be embarrassing for my generation of philosophers to start with the Greeks once over again.
4294240	4298640	No, it didn't start with the Greeks. The Greeks just wrote a lot. The Arabs saved their texts
4298640	4302480	and the Arabs saved the texts for us. And then we, inside, we made up the Greek system,
4302480	4305920	you know, the cradle civilization, whatever, and this sort of mythology about Europe.
4306480	4312160	Josephine Quinn's new book, How the World Made the West, amazing book, better than sapiens or
4312160	4316560	whatever. It's the biggest, best history book ever written by a woman from the UK and it just
4316560	4321440	kills the idea. The Greeks started civilization. So what I did is that was that I started looking
4321440	4326880	into Asian philosophy and I started into looking into the Indian and the Chinese and Japanese and
4326880	4331680	the Persian traditions. And then I discovered that the Persian tradition is the original Greek
4331680	4338720	philosophy. The word philosophy is from about 600 before Christ. It was used already by
4338720	4344160	Indian Iranians 1,100 years earlier as Maas Dal Yassna in Avestan Persian, which means the
4344160	4349200	love of wisdom. Basically, the Greeks just bought it and he had the keys Heraclitus. So
4349920	4355280	for all these things about Neoplatonism and Zen, if you look at the Silk Road and you look at the
4355280	4359600	Silk Road Triad, as I call it, which is the traditions of Buddhism with Shiaism as well
4360320	4364160	in India. And then you got Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrianism in Persia. And then you got
4364160	4368160	Daoism in China. Then you got all these different spiritual schools that would never really be
4368160	4371760	fought with each other. No recorded conflicts whatsoever. Basically, just one from one way
4371760	4376320	to the next along the Silk Road and you found slightly different variations of the same spiritual
4376320	4381840	themes. Trade routes, great. Whatever spirituality we go into next historically is human beings.
4381840	4385360	We should definitely look at the trade routes for inspiration because these religions are
4385360	4390640	non-digmatic. They're spiritual schools, they're follow practices, they're follow rituals, and
4390640	4395280	they basically fix our lives every day. So we get rid of the destructive bullshit and our mindset,
4395280	4399920	drop it somewhere and stay with the constructive mindset and build on that.
4399920	4404480	And so when I started Zoroastrianism, the original texts, the Gathas and the Saint of Vesta,
4404480	4408320	translated by Germans in the 19th century, I discovered, wait, this is exactly Heraclitus.
4408880	4413280	Heraclitus said the Greeks should not be Greeks. Heraclitus said we were Persians. We're part of
4413280	4417280	the Persian Empire. It was wrong we've been Persian, right? Heraclitus maybe even was Persian,
4417280	4421600	but the thing with Heraclitus is that by comparing Heraclitus fragments with Zoroastrian Gathas,
4421600	4425040	which I did 30 years ago, I discovered this is going to be the gold mine I'm going to work from.
4425840	4432000	And what I'm now doing, what we're probably doing now is basically the Zed in Zufism is,
4432000	4437520	of course, Zufism, be taking back Zufism from its origin. Zufism, taking it away from Islam.
4437520	4442080	Sorry guys, but you didn't invent this, you know, you always hated it and you always badmouthed it
4442080	4447040	because it was modest and all those things that we love. So basically Zufism is a modest
4447040	4452000	reinterpretation of Zufism as older than Islam. And we then discovered that this is exactly
4452000	4456240	what Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met. And Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met in contemporary
4456240	4460800	Central Asia. And of course, out of that, we got Bodhidharma, who was not a prince from India,
4460800	4466640	was a trader from Sogna. We got Babasavana, who is not an Indian Prince. He was another trader.
4466640	4472400	He came from Tajikistan today and he came to Tibet. So Varayana and Zen are just to be drenched,
4473200	4478480	drenched in Persian philosophy as much as their Chinese were Indian. And these are the richest
4478480	4482800	traditions I can find in the world today. See, if I'm going to do religion and philosophy and go back
4482800	4487760	5,000 years and go to find the gold mines and do whatever we can do today to understand ourselves
4487760	4492320	and our history as humans, this is the gold mine I'm totally obsessed with. I can't do Peru and
4492320	4497840	Mexico too. Other guys have to do that. But I'm totally obsessed with duration and with heritage
4497840	4502720	and I think where John and I are both heading, maybe this is the future where we can go into
4502720	4507360	conversation future, I think we're heading is that if I pursue Zufism, I mean, when John just
4507360	4514240	mentioned the Kyoto school, chairs came out of my eyes right away. These are my months I've spent
4514240	4519200	in Zen temples in Korea and Japan. This is exactly what I love the most about this conversation.
4519200	4523520	So I'm just dropping towards Zufism for the first time here because my team here in Scandinavia
4523520	4529280	agreed. We call each other Zufis now. You can call it Zen Zufis if you like, but we are practicing
4529280	4534480	now living a Zufism and we're obviously finding other Zufis out there around the world who also
4534480	4538560	managed to live with this sort of monist spiritual tradition with daily practices.
4538560	4543600	So just want to put that out there and then say that Neoplatonism, maybe then John can dig deeper
4543600	4548960	to whatever. I don't get too stuck with the Neoplatonist. I love Hellenism. I think Hellenism
4548960	4554480	was the most fantastic thing ever. But for me, it's actually deeper. I think before Plato, we go
4554480	4559920	before Plato with the priests of critics, we discovered they did philosophy flux. They did
4559920	4566400	Relationalism. Relationalism is the oldest philosophy. It's rather later when, you know,
4566400	4569840	the Greeks start thinking and mathematics comes into the picture, Pythagoras over there,
4569840	4573280	and there's so fatigued with mathematics, they think, well, there could be perfect forms out there.
4573280	4576720	Well, that's an interesting idea, but it's not actually how the world operates.
4576720	4581120	Today, it's the computer scientists with zeros and ones. And if they have billions of dollars,
4581120	4585680	think they're philosophers when they're really dangerous. So we have to respond to that whole
4585680	4591440	sort of computer science attempt to turn the world into zeros and ones and nothing but zeros and ones
4591440	4597040	and create this sort of deterministic nightmare that comes out of it and respond to that with what
4597040	4605280	John perfectly calls the radical uncertainty. The radical uncertainty is Hegel's. We are terrified
4605280	4612240	of our freedom because the future is completely contingent. It is the past which is a necessity
4612320	4618560	because the past is locked up. History in Hegel is like a zigzag. So everything the zigzag is
4618560	4622800	the past. Don't change that. Amofati, Nietzsche said, just accept that whatever happened happened.
4623680	4629440	That's factual truth. But the future is completely scaringly contingent and open and we are active
4629440	4634080	agents engaged in the future. And for me, that's being a Sufi. So I'll leave it at that.
4634080	4638080	Well, lovely. John, you want to respond to that? And then I'll take some questions from the audience.
4638080	4644160	Yeah. Bart, you may be pleased to know that the next big series I'm working on and it's going to
4644160	4648960	be Titanically Bigger than my previous two. I'm going to go on like on location. It's going to be at
4649760	4656320	different levels of media presentation. A macro, a mezzo and a micro is called the Philosophical
4656320	4662400	Silk Road in which I actually pick up the proposal. Now, I talk about Xanthoplatonism,
4662480	4670080	but we can quibble about things like that. I think Neil Platonism plays a role in Sufism too.
4671280	4677200	But I don't want to get mired in a historical argumentation here. I think the orientation
4677840	4684640	is very much aligned. And true to my criticism of Hegel, I'm not going to merely talk about this.
4685200	4689840	This has become a personal pilgrimage for me. I'm going through a purgation process right now
4689840	4695600	that I have not called for, but has called me in which I'm fundamentally preparing to actually go
4695600	4701360	to these places and be transformed by looking at the past, by also drenching myself in what I call
4701360	4712000	the geo-philosophy, the culture and the history. And so making myself a vehicle that's too pretentious,
4712000	4716080	at least put myself in service of the advent of the sacred that is happening right now
4716080	4720400	in response to the meeting crisis. But it seems like what you are talking about and what
4721120	4725120	I'm talking about, though not identical or deeply convergent. So I just wanted to reply to that.
4725840	4730880	That's the next big project, right? So that's really lovely. And actually,
4730880	4736160	there's a question from Victor. So I'm going to go to some Q&A. I'll see if I can pick it up
4736160	4741040	in the chat if there are other kinds of elements. If Victor wants to unmute, he can read this or
4741040	4748800	I will read it for him. I think it's a fascinating question. Wait a second. I'm not sure. Why don't
4748800	4752320	I go ahead and read it, Victor, if you're around and you can unmute and then you can dialogue.
4753280	4759920	And so here's the question. Our being in an emergence pervades our collective awareness,
4759920	4767360	gestured at as a time between worlds. How can a philosophy of transcendental emergentism
4767920	4775520	inform science such that the preferable emerges? Where do we want to go? What do we cultivate?
4775520	4781040	What's the relationship, I think, between facts and values? Is there a direction where we're
4781040	4785680	cultivating preferable? I hope I don't put too many words in Victor's mouth. But I'll throw that
4785680	4791040	out there and see if somebody wants to pick up. What are we oriented toward? What are we trying
4791040	4795280	to do in form of science? I would also wonder also about practices, et cetera.
4797760	4802640	I would, first of all, say that one of the things that comes out of this, and Pickstock does a lot
4802640	4808000	of work on this and so does filler, but other people have, I've mentioned case beer, putnam,
4808000	4812880	some of my own work. The fact value distinction, the is-ot distinction, is breaking down.
4814000	4817600	It doesn't mean there aren't differences, but there are differences like the difference between
4817600	4823600	two colors, right? They're on a continuum of degree and they're not differences in kind.
4824560	4830000	You can't actually ever state a fact that is not simultaneously a value judgment.
4830000	4834400	You can't make any value judgment that is not simultaneously a statement of fact.
4834960	4840880	They are non-logically identical, but they are inseparably interpenetratingly bound to one
4840880	4846880	another. And I think as long as we still frame this as we have to solve the is-ot problem,
4846880	4851840	no. I don't often invoke Wittgenstein, but here's where I think Wittgenstein is
4851840	4856800	appropriate. We don't solve the is-ot problem. We are in a place now where we dissolve it,
4856800	4863200	and then we get back to an ontology that allows us for profound connectedness to reality.
4863760	4872560	And I think for me, any way forward that doesn't prioritize that connectedness
4873440	4881360	to the religio in a way that is rationally self-confident, sending, rationally self-correcting,
4881360	4884320	all that sort of stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about here, and that's part of
4884320	4888560	what Hegel was on about. It is rationally self-correcting. It's just not strictly
4888560	4893520	syllogistic logic, right? Because the process is to be self-correcting or you can't distinguish
4893520	4902400	foolishness from wisdom. But I think for me, what comes out of this, and I can make a deeper
4902400	4910240	argument, but wise love, agopic love, like what is guiding you to loving more wisely,
4910240	4915040	and what is allowing you to love wisdom in an interpenetrating manner. I think
4916480	4923760	if people are looking for a practical normativity to guide them in practice, that's important.
4924320	4928320	And then one other thing I would say is give up the monological standpoint.
4929200	4934800	The evidence is now overwhelming. We reason better collectively than we do individually.
4934800	4941200	Experimental evidence is merging. And this is what I would say, not pushback on Bard. I think this is
4942000	4947520	amplification. The dialectic has to be accompanied with a diologos, which is
4947520	4953680	dialogical practice, because that gives you the cognitive agent that is actually capable of doing
4953680	4960720	this new kind of realization of a new kind of ontology, in which fact and value are no longer
4961360	4965440	separate, in which theory and data are no longer separate, in which analytic and synthetic are
4965440	4972720	no longer separate, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bard is right. This is hard, but it is already
4972720	4978080	happening. And I think we should orient to the places. Here is one of them, and there are many
4978160	4985360	others where it's happening. And we should do our best to culturally try to bind all these places
4985360	4992320	and practices together. That would be my recommendation. I agree totally with John here.
4992320	4997120	It's just called Nartological Dialectics in my dingo, but it's exactly the same thing. So it's
4997120	5002080	a very humbling kind of standard dialectics works, and you can't arrive at a fixed point anytime.
5002640	5006000	I think the really scary thing right now out there is that the people who were
5006000	5011120	diabetic have gone fundamentalist and gone hysterical, as we're seeing in the Middle East
5011120	5015760	right now. That's terrifying, especially if these guys have access to atomic bombs and can blow us
5015760	5020960	all up. That's a very, very real threat. And the reason why it goes hysterical is because
5020960	5027520	fundamentalism is like the end state of something that's already dead. It's like imagine an ideology
5027520	5033520	which is zombie-like. It is almost dead. So the last thing you do is that if God does not intervene
5033520	5037760	in the world as he should do according to your dogma, you have to act on God's behalf.
5038560	5043440	The scary thing right now with Islam and Christianity is they might get the armageddon
5043440	5049440	they prophesied about, but it's all self-made. This is terrifying. This is very, very real.
5049440	5055600	My recommendation then is to say the revolution is currently completely on the technological side,
5055600	5060560	and that's scary because the revolution is going hay-walk right now and needs to be contained.
5060640	5067280	For me as a human, that means I react exactly the opposite way. I retract. The most radical thing to
5067280	5073680	do as a human today is to retract, like John so wisely says, like we all do here, retract, step
5073680	5080560	back, go into retreat, observe the world from the outside. And yeah, it's about love. It's about love.
5080560	5086000	It's about finding that spot where that love is and feeling, be human. This is why we can't do
5086000	5092320	for loss without spirituality any longer. It's just another data. But what I'm saying is that
5092320	5098080	what Hegel did is that he basically said his absolute is on the meta-level precisely because
5098080	5103920	he doesn't allow any absolute on the formal level. That's exactly why Hegel is great in the sense
5103920	5108640	that he says that the only absolute I have is that there is no absolute in the sense that
5108640	5114240	there is only movement and flux all the time, and all we can do then we try to think those fluxes
5114240	5120080	are dialectical processing and dialectical thinking. And that's what we can do to not arrive at any
5120080	5125120	fixed point, only temporary solutions to temporary problems. And that's what we do all the time.
5125120	5131120	That means it's incredibly anti-dogmatic. That's the whole point. And the anti-dogmatism is exactly
5131120	5134240	what we need more of the world today. Whenever you can, if you're going to be a missionary about
5134240	5139280	anything today, you're going to be a missionary about anti-dogmatic, go anti-dogmatic and dissolve
5139280	5142080	these dogmas out there because they're the ones that are really affecting us.
5143040	5144880	Bonnie, did you yet want me to respond to that?
5145520	5152480	Yeah, I wanted to ping on what was where John and Barb were talking about philosophy is
5152480	5159200	dialogic. And then I saw a question pop up in the chat, could Bonnie give us examples of fierce
5159200	5167440	naturalism? So I can kind of answer, build on the dialogic by answering with what I would call
5167440	5173760	fierce naturalism. Okay, so on the one hand, there's on one level, I completely agree that
5175040	5183520	philosophy is dialogical. But I think we there's so the fierce naturalism would say yes,
5183520	5191040	but not dialogic at the level of words and thinking with thoughts. And this is where
5192000	5197280	if you think of the concept of a stack, I think that so for example,
5199920	5206880	if you can imagine atoms, atoms are dialogical, they're resonance with each other, there's either
5206880	5212080	constructive or deconstructive interference. And this is a kind of feeling between the
5212080	5218560	resonance. And then we get to sentience. And sentience is a dialogue through touch,
5218880	5223760	you know, so the worm oscillating in an ordered environment is touching the environment.
5224400	5231520	So that's I touch, and then we have cognizance, where these are gestures, these are physical,
5231520	5237680	in emotional aphid laden gestures at the animal mind level, let's say, and that's
5237680	5244880	dialogic gestures are dialogic gesture is touch at a distance. And then we get into the Hellenistic
5244880	5250960	and the lyrical philosophies, pre Socratic philosophies, where people are saying or singing.
5250960	5258400	So this is a calm response, the Psalms and the lyrical Hellenistic philosophy. So you just feel
5258400	5269680	what this is, this I touch, I gesture, I say, I sing, then you get into the great epic of Gilgamesh
5269680	5275760	and the narratives of the Iliad and the Odyssey. And now we're right at the heels of the Socratic
5277200	5282960	time. And this is when we're starting to tell. So instead of like lyrical and saying with that
5282960	5288400	with, you know, saying in a calm response, you have someone telling the whole history of the
5288400	5295920	people, the whole history of, you know, Troy, and the whole history and these become so there's a
5295920	5303040	reduction in the dialogical nature at this point in history. And then with the Socratics,
5303040	5310880	I would argue that becomes I name. So instead of telling a story of a man who was courageous,
5310880	5316960	but also an asshole to his wife, and all these kinds of very complex ways in which humans in
5316960	5323120	nature show up in the as in the allegories, we start to say, Well, that's too confusing, we never
5323120	5330800	see a real courageous man, because sometimes he's not courageous. So let's extract and isolate these
5330800	5338720	virtues, these variables from reality, and name them. And this is, I think, where we're the next
5338720	5347120	phase is now we name, then we're going to compute. Okay. So I see this progression that the telling
5347120	5354880	and then the naming is a bottleneck. And so we go from sentience, cognizance, consciousness,
5355520	5362400	to reflexive awareness. And this is where we get to I tell, I name, I compute. So it's the
5362400	5368320	progressive simulation of the self. And then we start dialoguing with the self. And I think this
5368320	5375040	is a bottleneck. So what we're doing in we call it lyric culture is now we want to move from
5375040	5381920	reflexive awareness to receptive awareness. So there's an opening as john describes very well,
5381920	5388640	I see I see with the eye of the soul. This is kind of a Gnostic insight. And then you go from
5388640	5393200	receptive awareness to open awareness. So receptive awareness, you still have the sense that
5394000	5401040	you're receiving perceptions and open awareness is more like I'm feeling. And so we're back to
5401360	5409440	Whitehead's insight that there's a resounding resonance of feeling that I am embedded it,
5409440	5415760	I'm not I'm not just receiving it. And then we I mean, this is this is all, you know,
5416800	5423840	a methodology. And then from there, you become you get the sense of the I am. And this is the
5423840	5430400	transcendent sense of the radiant being of reality or the radiance being the radiance of God,
5430400	5436400	or the radiance of the divine. And you find that within yourself. And the naming the telling
5436400	5443280	and the naming and the computing are in the wrong direction. We have to dial that back and move to
5443280	5450240	our receptive awareness, open awareness, and the sense of original radiance, which you might say
5450880	5458560	is how the universe started. So that's kind of like a fierce naturalism take on this conversation.
5458560	5464000	And I thank you for the opportunity to put it on the table. It's not completely resonant with
5464000	5474240	what else we've been talking about. Okay. What I'd like to do now is I've got another question.
5474240	5479360	Second one that came up, this is from Spencer. I'll read it, Spencer, certainly feel free to
5479360	5485600	pop in. But I'll read this is actually directed at Alexander Bard. How do you feel about the idea
5485600	5490880	that Hegel needs to be read together with Schelling and later ficta 1804 plus to be fully
5490880	5495680	relationally understood, for instance, to fully read Hegel with whitehead and delused?
5498480	5502480	That's where the question ends if Spencer wants to. So where does Hegel fit?
5503280	5507600	Yeah, okay. But that's been done. That's been done a lot. Hegel is put together with the German
5507600	5514640	idealists, and he's not an idealist. He's really a dialectician. The way I do Hegel is I do Hegel's
5514640	5520240	method. And then I provocatively call myself a pan dialecticist. I think fundamentally,
5520240	5523600	everything in the universe, the only thing I can say about all the different mergers vectors,
5523600	5527680	if they all seem to have some kind of dialectical quality to them. So I just call myself a pan
5527680	5533680	dialecticist. Then I learned the lesson from Hegel. No, what wasn't done is the weird artificial
5533680	5537440	opposition between Hegel and Nietzsche. When I started reading the guys my teenage years,
5537440	5542880	he was like, they're compatible. They're perfectly compatible. I mean, Nietzsche's armor fought
5542880	5548400	which is his, you know, axiology. It's just where his values start from. It's exactly like Hegel's
5548400	5552400	the necessity of the past and scared of the contingency of the future and the freedom. It's
5552400	5557440	exactly affirmation in Nietzsche. They're perfectly compatible. And I'm glad the whole new generation
5557440	5560960	today, at least in Europe, they're all reading Hegel and Nietzsche through each other, which is
5560960	5565920	incredibly productive to get all the best uses bits out of these amazing 90s century thinkers.
5566400	5572000	Then when you start looking at the 20th century, I found Whited, who I loved to bits,
5572800	5579200	and he also does relationalism. And it's almost like Whited. Deleuze, of course, later in France,
5579200	5582720	in the late 20th century, Deleuze does the same thing with Guattari in France,
5582720	5587360	and they're amazing thinkers. I love Deleuze and Foucault. These are the guys I grew up with.
5587360	5593680	But Deleuze's attempt at trying to do Hegel as if Hegel did not exist is exactly what Whited
5593680	5599840	actually did. Whited did Hegel as if Hegel did not exist, and then applied on the natural sciences
5599840	5605120	and mathematics and tons of stuff that Hegel was not aware of, which is why I think Whited is fantastic.
5605120	5610720	So I prefer to use the Hegelian method and read it through the 20th century thinkers and then try
5610720	5615600	to read it through us and try to read it through 20th century philosophy, what the Hegelian method
5615600	5621840	can mean today. But as method, it is amazing. And I'm so glad that John, who's so fantastic,
5622080	5626000	is now going to put his head on to Hegel because the day for Varkey goes on Hegel.
5627200	5634240	That's got to be enormous. Okay. I've got a question here from Kevin Katwas.
5635520	5643440	And this question is, how does an ontology of pure relationality relate to the emerging digital
5643440	5649840	network decentralized institutions of the future? How does an ontology of pure relationality relate
5649920	5654400	to an emerging digital network and decentralized institutions of the future?
5657120	5662480	I guess that's kind of my question again anyway. It's the paradigm we're in right now is the network
5662480	5667600	dynamical paradigm. Some call it digital, some call it the internet, some call it AI, whatever.
5667600	5672640	What happened is the technology now is going global. We get satellites everywhere. Everything is
5672640	5677280	interconnected. The threat there is to arrive in a surveillance police state. We don't want that. So
5677280	5681760	I'm totally with decentralization and try to think how can we still have a network dynamical
5681760	5686320	society with all its benefits but still lived in a decentralized way? That's a fairly difficult
5686320	5692720	question to solve. Is it typical axiological question today? So we are networked up because we
5692720	5700240	I've got a question here from Cody Palmer. Does a neoplatonic framework create an ontological
5700240	5709440	structure? Greg, can you hear us? I think you couldn't hear you, Alexander. I think that's a
5709440	5719840	problem. All right. Greg, are you still there? He looks frozen. Yeah, that's Alexander just
5719840	5724080	hanging on a sec. I think that's what happened there. I don't think he was being rude. I think
5725040	5727200	he thought you'd stopped. Yeah.
5734000	5737840	I could just finish the answer as soon as he can get where to back because the rest of you are all
5737840	5743120	here, right? It was just Greg's problem, right? Yeah. He'll be back. So I'm just going to finish
5743120	5748160	the question. The thing is that I'm with Marsha McLuhan, an amazing philosopher, by the way,
5748160	5753280	in that media we use. I'm going to show you this because the last time you said him,
5753600	5758880	did you have you read his Remedian book? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I mean,
5758880	5762720	if anybody's going to save the pope, it's going to be Marsha McLuhan, the best Catholic in the
5762720	5770800	world, right? But the thing is that the media we use will also affect how we think. And that's why
5771440	5775280	this sort of minoritarian thinking that Hegel and White did practice at the time is not
5775280	5779600	becoming majoritarian. We're all starting to think like they think because living in a world
5779600	5784400	drenched in network relations and we try to figure out how relations must work. And it's fantastic
5784400	5789840	to live in a relations universe. So why not? But that's why that's why relations become a big
5789840	5794160	topic because it actually reflects the technological environments we are in right now.
5796960	5800640	I'd like to answer to that too, then, while we wait for Greg to come back.
5802240	5807440	And I think this is actually convergent with what Bart is saying. What you still have,
5808320	5811920	and this goes to what we're now in what's called the fourth rationality debate. We've had a whole
5811920	5817360	bunch. What is rationality? You still have people claiming that this can ultimately be grasped in
5817360	5825440	an a priori axiomatic system, all of this. And that that is kind of the epistemological version
5825440	5832320	of the zombie fundamentalism that Bart was pointing to, but within a scientific, scientific
5833120	5839520	framework. And part of what we try to argue in two papers, one is
5840480	5843760	relevance, rationality and relevance realization. The other one is naturalizing
5843760	5848320	relevance realization. Is that project is actually doomed? You can't do it that way.
5848320	5854640	It's not that there aren't top down aspects, but you can't step out. This is Hegel. You can't
5854640	5860320	step out and give an a priori top down, right? Optimization that will work algorithmically
5860320	5866400	across all possible contexts. This is the last ditch attempt that is being made in order to
5866400	5873280	wrestle with the network reality and the dynamic system reality we're realizing here. And I think
5874080	5882000	that is a kind of scientific fundamentalism that is strongly analogous to a lot of religious
5882000	5890240	fundamentalisms that we have. But because they typically don't blow up buildings or what not
5890560	5895680	they don't get the deserved attention. But if you don't think these people are going to cause
5895680	5902000	terrific suffering, if they succeed, I think you're being foolish. So I would want to point out that
5903200	5910880	there is an attempt to recapture all of what Bart was pointing to, right, about network dynamics
5912080	5919680	in a top down, a priori axionomic formal systemization. And I think this is the last ditch
5919680	5927440	attempt. And so I think that has to be properly challenged and resisted. I've been trying to do
5927440	5935520	so, by the way. And I think other people are. I totally agree with John. That's why I said
5935520	5940320	Surveillance Police State. Yes. And this book Processing Event is a manifesto against that
5940320	5944080	happening. The scientist fundamentalists are going to go for the surveillance police state and they're
5944080	5947360	going to do good in the world. It's like vulgar Platonism. They're going to go for the good in
5947360	5951840	the world by controlling absolutely everything. Well, that's already happening, because T and
5951840	5956480	Ping is trying to do it in China with vulgar Confucianism, because vulgar Confucianism is
5956480	5962000	exactly vulgar Platonism. And these are the two heritages we got in Eastern and Western thinking
5962000	5966640	we need to get rid of once and for all. We call them the pillar saint ideologies. The pillar
5966640	5972080	saint ideologies that Confucianism and Platonism at his worst is the little 11 year old boy who
5972080	5976560	threw his wonderful little idea that if everybody did everything the way I think they should do
5976560	5981680	the world will be wonderful and everything be a sunny day forever. And they're there. I mean,
5981680	5985920	most computer scientists I meet when they start to think about philosophy, their mind gets stuck
5985920	5990960	there. I think it's great that you mentioned that here, John. Scientific fundamentalism is
5990960	5995600	exactly, scientific fundamentalism is the right term for that. And it's just as scary as any
5995600	5999360	of the other fundamentalists, especially these guys have so much power and influence today.
5999360	6003760	We've got to avoid the surveillance police state precisely because we need an open society
6003760	6009920	without an open society, all freedom is gone. All right. Hey, folks, I'm back.
6010960	6016800	It looks like we have Scott. It's got a question. I'm noting the time here. Why don't we ask Scott
6016800	6023360	a question, respond to that, and then we'll congeal, give some final thoughts, and then we'll end
6023360	6029200	the session that way. Scott. Thank you very much. I appreciate having the opportunity to open my mic.
6029200	6034880	I tried to type the question and it blew up. Alexander, I very much appreciate your rich,
6036240	6043040	bold understanding of Hegel. And if we're going to talk about Hegel and Whitehead
6043040	6048720	and be serious about process ontology, then stability becomes a scale relative phenomenon.
6049520	6056320	In other words, the things, one of the things I've confirmed your speaking language.
6057280	6063920	Hold on. Okay. Hold on. There you go. Okay. Sorry. I got a zoom thing I had to answer.
6063920	6070640	A question I have. This is in my work. I look at where you, the things you described,
6070640	6074480	where we weren't wrong with thingism. Why would it's difficult to think relationally?
6075520	6080880	One of the artifacts of the way dynamical systems work is that dynamic stable states emerge
6081520	6087760	relatively in a dynamic space. So they're transient. Yet we've confused the stability with
6087760	6095040	the fixedness. Our thoughts come to be as temporally stable states that come and go in a
6095040	6101600	hyper complex nervous dynamic. Our words are the same. So I think I just want to get your reaction
6101600	6106400	to the idea that we've confused the stable states that our brains necessarily create to have things
6106400	6113200	we call thoughts. We've confused those abilities with the way the world is, not seeing the actual
6113200	6118960	multi-scale dynamic work that makes the emergence of temporarily stable states possible. I know
6118960	6125440	there was a lot, but I had to ask that of you given your talk. Totally agree. That's why the book is
6125440	6132800	called process and event. In a very, very, very fundamental rudimentary addressing all the
6132800	6136960	problem of the East and the West, where East and West can learn is that the East got stuck with
6136960	6141520	process and I've never met Chinese or an Indian intellectual who didn't agree with me. They got
6141520	6145760	stuck with the process. The problem was that in Western culture, especially through Islamic
6145760	6150000	Christianity, we got so obsessed with the event and we forgot about the process. What then happened
6150000	6155360	is that the event itself becomes endlessly repeated. Christ on the cross all the time,
6155360	6159120	Mohammed storming Mecca all the time, every year again and again, say we're from the back.
6160000	6165360	The problem is that reality is process and event, meaning human is process and event,
6165360	6171280	East and West, man and woman, dynamic relations all the way down. I'm just basically advocating,
6171280	6176400	if you can think that the event is the stability and it's temporary, remember it's temporary,
6176400	6181120	so you can use it and build from, but then things will move on and the new process will start.
6181120	6187360	Then what happens is you realize that processes are repeated, but the process is never identical
6187360	6194640	to the previous lap of the process. That tiny little difference enables you to create an event
6194640	6199680	and change history forever in a new constructive direction. I think that's a wonderful thought
6199680	6204880	that any engineer I've ever met is thrilled about hearing because they try to find that little spot
6204880	6209200	where they can improve on the world every day when they work. So process and event,
6209200	6212160	that's what the books call that. That's the unity of the two.
6212480	6222720	All righty, that's lovely. Let me offer a few thoughts first off. First off, thank you all
6222720	6228720	for really stimulating our 45 minutes. My heart is filled with joy to stay at the primate level
6229440	6234800	and the exchange of ideas, the feeling in the room was really good. One thing,
6234800	6239680	a couple things I want to mention. One is let's make sure we're clear about where we're locating
6239680	6246480	how we're entering into this. Certainly, Utah's location is explicit. I appreciated our exchange
6246480	6251680	being clear where John's coming from. I think where Bernice is coming from. Understanding
6251680	6256240	where we're entering and then to see the convergence through those various elements,
6257360	6264480	to me, is really inspiring and fascinating. Another area of convergence I want to mention
6264560	6271440	with Bard is that narratology with its logos, pathos, and mythos has lots of parallels with
6271440	6276320	Utah's epistemological pillars of the Tree of Knowledge, the Iquocoin, and the Garden. That's
6276320	6282480	really a logos, pathos, mythos, frame of reference. I also want to speak to some of what obviously I
6282480	6287600	share with John and our hope for transcendent naturalism, at least in relationship to a
6287600	6293520	strong transcendence of a collective emergence, a collective intelligence that transforms the
6293520	6298480	onto epistemological relation. I think that's desperately needed. The last thing I'll say
6298480	6304960	in relationship to Bonnie is the embodiment of being. Contact with the cutting through
6304960	6310240	metaphysics down into the experience of being, to me, is absolutely central and we've lost that
6310800	6316880	in many ways. To regain that is aspects of the core of the task as I see us moving forward.
6317600	6322800	All of these things, to me, are connecting in particular ways. They're inspiring. They're
6322800	6329120	spurring lots of thoughts. I'll go to John and then Bonnie and Bard can have the last word and
6329120	6333760	then we can wrap up. John, any final thoughts you want to share as we bring this to a close?
6335200	6344800	I found this tremendously fecund. I'm always impressed when there's considerable convergence
6344800	6351200	and its convergence. There's enough difference. We're not just echo-chambering. Convergence
6351200	6358320	requires that there's real difference, although they come to shared conclusions,
6359280	6365120	maybe resolutions is a better word, because that raises the plausibility of the overall framework
6365120	6370800	dramatically. If Bonita working, I'm not claiming we're completely independent of each other,
6370800	6374640	that's ridiculous, but she's working independently. Bard is working independently.
6374640	6378400	There's significant enough differences between what we're saying that we're not just echoing
6378400	6387680	each other. As we unwrap, unfold our particular argumentative paths, we come to very similar
6387680	6394400	kinds of realizations. I think that raises the overall plausibility. I would say that if you
6394400	6401200	listen to the geist between the three of us, you actually get the best possible argument
6402080	6404560	for what is needed right now.
6406880	6408320	Lovely. Bonnie?
6411040	6428800	Yeah, I just want to end by pointing out a kind of confusion. My work, as you kind of situated
6429360	6441600	my work, always emphasizes the animal level. But what I hope you can understand from my work
6441600	6447200	is that I'm not just, you see, the problem is when you work from the kind of stratified
6447200	6454320	reality that you have, you're saying my work is down there in the animal realm. This is the problem
6454400	6461360	with the stocks, because my work is saying, okay, this reflexive awareness, we're telling,
6461360	6467360	we're naming, we're going to compute. Just because this is more on the scene recently,
6467360	6474240	it could be a mistake. There could be an alternative. It could be the wrong way.
6474240	6481040	I'm saying that these other moves come out of our animal nature, but they're beyond the human
6481120	6497280	condition so far. This is why it's tricky to have always work from that stock, because I'm not a
6497280	6507600	pagan. You're going like this, you know, I know you know. I just want to end with that. I too found
6507600	6515680	the conversation lovely and very complex and probably challenging for many people who
6515680	6521760	stayed stuck with us, because there's so many different worlds popping up. And so yeah,
6521760	6527840	and thank you all so much for being a part of this. Lovely. I'll just say amen.
6529440	6535120	Barb? Yeah, I just want to say that this was like the most wonderful check-in with you guys.
6535120	6539360	I'm sitting here on the other side of the Atlantic and you're some of my best friends in
6539360	6544640	North America and it's just wonderful to collaborate with you. And I will dig into your work even more
6544640	6550960	than ever, all three of you. And certainly I'm very inspired. I'm working on a term myself at the
6550960	6554640	moment, which was not part of this conversation, but just to point out how inspiring this is.
6554640	6558080	And it's called emotional intelligence. And this is the ridiculous thing.
6558080	6562640	Intelligence is currently the most important word in our language and it's not being defined by
6562640	6567600	anybody. That in itself is terrible. That's a really dangerous position that we're actually
6567600	6571920	using the word intelligence as if we knew we're talking about it. There are so many Italian
6571920	6577600	gents to begin with. And AI is just one of them and a minor one, to be honest about it. So I'm
6577600	6581360	working with the concept of emotional intelligence, which I think it ties in very nicely with White
6581360	6586400	Ted and very nicely with Bonita's work, just the example of how inspiring this conversation is.
6586400	6590800	But that's another conversation altogether. All right, well, maybe we'll have future
6590800	6597520	conversations then. All right, folks, thank you so much, each of you, for bringing your wisdom.
6597520	6602800	It's been a real joy. It's lovely to host this in the context of the Utah Consilience Conference
6603360	6608320	and to think about the kinds of philosophies, metaphysic, empirical experiences of being
6608320	6614320	oriented toward wisdom in the 21st century. And I love the dance and I appreciate the connection.
6614960	6618960	Thanks to everybody. Thanks for all the questions. Super engaging. So what we're doing now is
6618960	6622240	basically you got an hour. I think there's plenty to digest here and go for a walk,
6623280	6626960	get a cup of coffee. We'll be back at one o'clock where you have three options
6627600	6632080	for three wonderful symposia. And then again, at three o'clock, three options. I'm really
6632080	6636400	looking forward to the afternoon. I feel like conference off to a great start and go get some
6636400	6643280	nourishment, share some love, hang out, meditate, etc. We'll see everybody soon. Okay, take care.
