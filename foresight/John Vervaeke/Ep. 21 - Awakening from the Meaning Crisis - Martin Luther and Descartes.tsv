0	17240	Welcome back to Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.
17240	20720	Last time we took a look at the advent of the Scientific Revolution and we looked at
20720	28040	the work of Copernicus and how the important advent of a scientific description of reality
28040	36360	had with it the consequence that most of our sensory experience was questionable as
36360	38200	illusory in nature.
38200	46800	Galileo also developed that idea of the math as the language of reality and used that with
46800	51800	the new experimental method, a method also born out of the idea that most of our cognition
51800	59800	is deceptive and biasing in nature and he used that to discover inertial motion and
59800	66200	that changed the notion of matter into something that exists and resists our will.
66200	71640	But that had the effect of killing the universe and making it purposeless in nature.
71640	79440	And thus we become odd islands of meaning and purpose in a vast ocean of meaningless
80280	83960	material motion.
83960	90160	So all of that of course is going to have an impact on people's self-understanding,
90160	96560	their demeaning that they're using to make sense of their existence.
96560	102360	And look what's happening here, that Aristotelian idea that the structure of your experience
102360	108600	and the structure of reality conform has been radically undermined and now you are trapped
108600	119360	within your own mind behind veils of illusion disconnected from the world.
119360	126960	And God has become progressively more and more a matter of will.
126960	131880	There's an individual that takes all of this up and he does more than just think about
131880	134320	this or speak about it or write about it.
134360	143120	He's one of those really titanic individuals who exemplifies the chaos and the anxiety of
143120	144120	his time.
144120	146080	This is Martin Luther.
146080	149560	He's definitely deeply influenced.
149560	150560	He's German.
150560	152680	He's deeply influenced by the Rhineland mystics.
152680	160280	He's influenced by that growing tradition of the self as radically self-negating inner
160280	166760	conflict being at the core of spirituality.
166760	168200	He's an Augustinian monk.
168200	176400	He's deeply influenced by Augustine's ideas of self-depravity and our inability to achieve
176400	179880	mystical union with God unaided.
179880	186160	And through Augustine, Luther of course is deeply immersed in and impressed with Paul's
186160	193720	ideas about our inner conflict and now that parallels a conflict within God between God's
193720	200840	love towards us and God's justice driven anger and wrath towards us.
200840	204680	And Martin Luther is very terrified of that wrath.
204680	208800	He's very terrified of it.
208800	215080	And he has taken that notion through taller of mystical self-negation and it has become
215080	223760	radicalized because of the influence of Augustine and Paul and his own inner conflict.
223760	230560	So that the self-negation in Luther's psyche has become self-loathing.
230560	238400	He experiences the self as radically folded into itself, obsessed with itself in a completely
238400	241520	immorally self-centered fashion.
241520	252480	So the self is this radical self-feeding self-negating because as the self is unfolded and obsessed
252480	260480	with itself, it is simultaneously being cut off from God and cut off from reality.
260480	269880	So it is very much a self-destructive process and I really want you to hear that self-destructive
269880	274760	process that he sees as the essence of the self.
274760	279920	So this is Luther's interpretation of the biblical notion of pride and rebellion against
279920	289520	God that we are intrinsically self-obsessed in this self-aggrandizing self-destructive
289520	292480	fashion.
292480	299560	So try to think of moments in your life that will give some substance to what Luther is
299560	301520	saying.
301520	305360	You have discovered a pattern of behavior self-destructive.
305360	311280	For example, perhaps you keep dating the same kind of person and you keep going back to this
311280	317080	and it keeps turning out to be wrong for you, perhaps also wrong for the other person.
317080	320960	So you step back and you've talked to friends and you reflect it and you make a deliberate
320960	321960	conscious effort.
321960	326640	No, no, I'm not going to date this person, this kind of person anymore, I'm not going
326640	327640	to date that type of person.
327640	330880	I'm going to date this type of person and that will change things.
330880	336040	I'll break this pattern and you go in and you find somebody, they seem to be totally
336040	344200	different and you start dating them and then lo and behold, against your will, even though
344200	349440	it seems to be something that you willfully brought about, you find yourself caught in
349440	353520	the same destructive pattern again.
353520	360040	Of course Freud and Jung and the whole psychodynamic tradition, very much, part of the legacy of
360040	365400	Luther by the way, are going to make much of that fact that we keep repeating, even
365400	372160	in our conscious efforts to change our behavior, we keep repeating these self-destructive patterns.
372160	379760	So although I'm critical of Luther, there's a deep truth here in Luther, there is the
379760	388600	touching of the way in which our unconscious processes, our unconscious cognition can be
388600	393200	beset with these, we've talked about it, these parasitic processes that have a life of their
393200	397520	own and can consume us.
397520	403600	So Luther is convinced that he cannot do anything to save himself.
403600	412120	He takes Augustine's notion that the Neoplatonic mystical ascent is insufficient on its own
412120	417400	and has to be supplemented with the love of God through Christ.
417400	421560	He takes that and he radicalizes it in a very powerful way.
421560	425760	Because of his own personal wretchedness, he comes to the conclusion that there is nothing
425760	431440	he can do.
431440	437960	And that leads into a startling interpretation of Paul, an interpretation that is going to
437960	440160	put him at odds with the Catholic Church.
440160	448360	This is the interpretation that we are saved by faith alone, where faith becomes nothing
448360	458320	more than a complete acceptance of God's saving grace.
458320	464200	So let's unpack this very carefully because it's become so enmeshed in our way of thinking
464200	468240	and being.
468240	478600	The idea here is that faith is, notice what's happened, all that sense of participatory knowing,
478600	481280	the sense that we're participating in a process.
481280	486440	Remember the Israelite notion that we're participating in our cultural history, we're participating
486440	487960	in the creativity of God.
487960	491000	All of that is now gone.
491000	493680	It's gone.
493680	499160	And your sense of what it's like to be you, your sense of self, is completely twisted
499160	500160	and illusory.
500160	504640	So all the perspectival knowing, all the participatory knowing is being eradicated.
504640	512000	It's being reduced down to the acceptance of a proposition.
512000	516960	And an acceptance that cannot in any way be based on evidence or argument.
516960	522320	Because that would be your mind participating in your salvation.
522320	526440	It has to be a radical, pure acceptance.
526440	536560	So the self-negation of the Rhineland mystics has come to fruition in Luther's ideas here.
536560	539840	Now what does that mean?
539840	545200	That means that what you radically, radically have to accept is there's absolutely nothing
545200	547440	you can do.
547440	556120	And even your affirmation of the proposition of the creed of Christianity is something
556120	561080	that has to be given to you.
561080	563760	And what does that mean from God's side of this equation?
563760	568920	It means that God's act of saving you is completely arbitrary.
568920	577920	There is, since there is nothing you do, there's no thought, word or deed that you perform
577920	585840	that in any way earns or has any causal effect upon God's behavior.
585840	588920	And I'm not over-representing this.
588920	591280	Look at the debate between Luther and Erasmus.
591280	597820	Erasmus tried to propose what he called synergy, that the human being and God were working
597820	602260	together in a participatory fashion for salvation, with God, of course, having the bulk of the
602260	603260	work.
603260	606260	And Luther rejects that utterly.
606260	611900	God's saving of an individual is completely arbitrary.
611900	618380	So God has become, remember what we talked about in Occam, that God's will supersedes
618380	619380	his reason.
619380	625820	God's reason is now not involved at all.
625820	631100	It is just an arbitrary act of will that saves us.
631100	637460	And we have to radically accept that arbitrariness.
637460	640580	Now think about what that means.
640580	644820	And there's a weird, there's an irony here.
644820	649420	There's an irony here, and it's almost a self-referential irony.
649420	657580	Because Luther is trying, and I think he's very sincere, but he's trying to rescue us
657580	667460	from the fact that we are obsessed with ourself in an idolatrous fashion, and that that obsession
667460	671300	is a source of deep suffering for us.
671300	681060	We know that that self-obsession cuts us off, separates us.
681060	687220	But the irony is, in his endeavors to deal with that, look at what Luther is teaching.
687220	692340	What is he putting into our cultural grammar?
692340	701340	That we are inherently worthless, and that our inner life is one of self-loathing.
701340	712460	And the only solution to that is arbitrary, unearned regard.
712460	717620	This is the cultural training for narcissism.
717620	728100	Narcissism is to be trapped, to be self-obsessed within self-loathing, and that what you want
728100	734340	to alleviate is unearned positive regard.
734340	742640	Not for any reason, not for anything you've done, completely amoral unearned positive
742640	743640	regard.
743640	745020	That's narcissism.
745500	753060	One of the deep ironies of Luther's revolution is that, and I think there says something
753060	759700	about what's going on at the time, one of the deep ironies is he actually lays the grammar
759700	764360	for cultural narcissism.
764360	771500	We are all being trained to experience ourselves as wretched, self-obsessed, and that the only
771500	777020	solution is unearned positive regard.
777020	789720	And so we can see the spirit of Luther in our obsession with Instagram, in our obsession
789720	791400	with Snapchat.
791400	797540	We constantly want unearned positive regard.
798540	803620	Now, there are other consequences of this radical change.
803620	810780	Of course, immediate consequences, Luther comes into conflict.
810780	815020	He protests against the Roman Catholic Church.
815020	820460	That's what Protestant comes from, because the Catholic Church has a different doctrine
820460	831060	of salvation, that it's one in which the human being still has a participatory role.
831060	838340	And because of that, the Church also thinks that it's cultural history.
838340	840700	Think about how this is still an Israelite notion.
840700	847180	The Church still thinks that its tradition matters for human salvation, that participating
847180	852980	in that tradition, the tradition, the cultural history of the Church, is also something that
852980	856140	is needed.
856140	858900	Now I'm not advocating for Catholicism here over Protestantism.
858900	867620	I'm trying to get you to understand what the two sides were standing for.
867620	869420	So Luther is attacking all of that.
869420	871660	He's attacking the authority of the Church.
871660	874140	He's attacking the authority of tradition.
874140	880380	So history and tradition and institution don't matter.
880380	882620	Why?
882620	886180	Because Luther is a child of his time.
886180	889180	He is trapped inside his own mind.
889180	900380	He advocates that all that really matters in matters of faith are individual conscience.
900380	902460	And please remember what this word means.
902460	908580	It means knowing yourself, science, conscience, knowing yourself.
908580	914900	The one thing you know is yourself.
914900	918580	And so Luther refuses to recant.
918580	925540	He refuses to change his interpretation, to be in line with the Church, and he valorizes
925540	934340	individual conscience as the final authority over a person's spiritual life.
934340	935340	This lays the foundation.
935340	937020	So do you see what's happened here?
937020	943240	This withdrawal of meaning into the individual mind, isolated individual mind, is now being
943240	948940	appropriated as, well that must mean that the mind, the individual conscience, is the
948940	953940	final soul authority of what matters.
953940	955660	It's a radical idea.
955660	962460	Many other cultures find this a bizarre idea that we possess in the West.
962460	968900	And so of course there's a lot of discussion nowadays about individual responsibility, individual
968900	969900	authority.
969900	974820	We have, as Adorno talked about it, we have a cult of authenticity.
974820	982900	That being true to yourself, and this is Lutheran, being true to yourself is the ultimate authority
983020	986780	by which you should judge and evaluate your life.
986780	991340	Now notice what has happened.
991340	999900	The connection to reality, being true to reality, has been superseded by being true to yourself.
999900	1006900	And that is also emerging with a cultural grammar that is training us in narcissism.
1013700	1023580	Now because of this, Luther was a monk, and yet he comes to the conclusion that the monasteries
1023580	1025860	should be shut down.
1025860	1028140	Why would he come to that conclusion?
1028220	1037220	Well, the West, for a long time, had these paired institutions.
1037220	1043140	We had a knowledge institution that has already emerged and is being developed in the Middle
1043140	1050220	Ages, and this of course is the university, where it's supposed to get a universal education,
1050220	1056180	come to understand as much of reality, the universe as you can.
1056180	1065980	And that was paired to a place where you have to go through transformation in order to acquire
1065980	1070740	wisdom, and this is the monastery.
1070740	1079740	And so this is the idea here, that here you're seeking that self-transcendence.
1080460	1086460	This is the legacy of the Axial Revolution.
1086460	1091620	This of course is a response to the emergence of first Aristotelian science, and then the
1091620	1098620	new science of people like Bacon, Copernicus Galileo.
1098620	1105820	And the two are supposed to represent an important synthesis of how human beings are to make sense
1105820	1111500	of themselves and to find a meaningful life.
1111500	1125020	But this institution places a huge premium on self-transcendence, as we've seen.
1125020	1133180	And for Luther, this is the Grand Illusion, the idea that human beings are capable of
1133180	1143300	self-transcendence is something he thinks is the greatest lie that our self tells us.
1143300	1149900	He sees that as the greatest instance of the sin of pride.
1149900	1157700	See if you lose the perspectival participatory sense of faith, if faith just becomes assertion
1157700	1169820	born out of radical acceptance, then the idea of this being even possible to you disappears.
1169820	1179060	And so what happens is that these institutions are being shut down.
1179060	1185380	Now that means the university now needs something else in order to take this knowledge and give
1185380	1190140	it existential transformative relevance to individual lives.
1190140	1197280	The university has to be attached to something else that transforms people's lives, gives
1197280	1199780	structure and purpose to their existence.
1199780	1204580	And of course, we know what that's going to be.
1204580	1207300	That's going to be the state.
1207300	1210540	And knowledge is not going to be linked so much to wisdom.
1210540	1216700	It's going to be linked to politics.
1216700	1224620	And of course, that is going to be supported by the new science, people like Bacon famously
1224620	1234220	arguing that knowledge is power, the forerunner of the work of Michel Foucault and others.
1234220	1243860	So we get the loss of all the psychotechnologies of wisdom, of cultural communities that are
1243860	1248380	committed to providing guidance and support to people who want to cultivate wisdom, of
1248380	1253860	a historical tradition that can relay to us the patterns of success and failures and
1253860	1258820	give us practices that we can use to test out and try for transformation.
1258820	1261100	All of that is being lost.
1261100	1263980	So you know where to go for information.
1263980	1271420	You know where to go for knowledge, but now today you do not know where to go for wisdom.
1271420	1281680	We have sapiential obsolescence of our knowledge.
1281680	1291220	And we have knowledge being inextricably bound to the machinery of the state and to politics,
1291220	1299660	such that it is becoming increasingly difficult right now for us as a culture to distinguish
1299660	1309980	politics from knowledge, from the willful assertion of things that we must simply accept
1309980	1319660	because of an arbitrary will wielding power.
1319660	1328540	So the Protestant Reformation is titanic.
1328540	1336300	It is really inappropriate if you're trying to understand the advent of the meaning crisis
1336300	1338260	to only look at the scientific revolution.
1338260	1343940	You must look at the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation together.
1343940	1349700	They are conjoined.
1349700	1359260	Now there are other important aspects of the Protestant Reformation that come to the fore.
1359260	1365140	Because of his attack on tradition and institution, Luther advocates what he calls the priesthood
1365140	1367580	of all believers.
1367580	1369860	There is nothing in between.
1369860	1377420	There is no mediator between you and God.
1377420	1378820	There is no church.
1378820	1380300	There is no priest.
1380300	1381740	There is nothing here.
1381740	1387420	There is just a direct personal relationship.
1387420	1396900	Again this idea of your own personal spirituality has its root here.
1397380	1403860	Because of this, Luther argues that for the priesthood of all believers, everybody has
1403860	1407060	an equal spiritual authority.
1407060	1414180	Because of course learning processes of growth and self-transformation, those are no longer
1414180	1416340	important criteria.
1416340	1420900	All that matters is the degree to which God has saved someone.
1420900	1424500	Now we've talked about some of the negative consequences of that, but a positive consequence
1424500	1432700	for that is that Luther argues for a complete form of democracy within the church.
1432700	1439460	Everything should be decided democratically because there should not be any significant
1439460	1441580	authority or hierarchical structure.
1441580	1444300	Because Luther is rejecting all of that.
1444300	1451340	This of course is why the Catholic Church is so resisting to him, why they are so inimical
1451340	1452340	to him.
1452980	1460780	This idea eradicated because it undermines the very structure and existence of the institution
1460780	1463900	of the Catholic Church.
1463900	1469180	Now Luther doesn't propose political democracy.
1469180	1472940	He only proposes democracy within the church, but nevertheless that is going to give people
1472940	1481060	in their day-to-day lives experience with democratic processes, democratic decision-making.
1481060	1485060	In fact, in the areas that they consider most important about their lives, they are going
1485060	1487380	to be acting democratically.
1487380	1497740	Now Luther thinks that there shouldn't be democracy in the world outside of the church,
1497740	1505620	and when the peasants revolt in Germany because they are being influenced by this idea of
1505620	1510420	the importance of the individual, individual conscience and authority, Luther does not
1510420	1515980	side with the peasants, he sides with the princes, he sides with established authority.
1515980	1521220	He has a two-worlds doctrine, there is a doctrine within the church and that is a world that
1521220	1523580	is, remember how God is divided, right?
1523580	1526980	That is the world of God's love and that is where we act democratically.
1526980	1531860	But outside the church we don't know who is saved and who is not saved, we will come back
1531860	1532860	to that point.
1532860	1537220	And because of that, that is the world under God's wrath, then that is the world that has
1537220	1544740	to be kept in check by political authority, wielding the sword of power.
1544740	1559140	Again, that is a dark aspect of Luther, but it also brings with it the beginning of an
1559140	1565780	idea of the separation of church and state, radical new idea.
1565780	1569580	And Luther of course is proposing it because he is proposing it that within the church,
1569580	1574940	under God's love, people should be treated one way and outside of the church, which is
1574940	1579020	under God's wrath, there should be a different way in which people are treated and politically
1579020	1584340	operate and the state should not interfere with the church.
1584340	1589660	So we get the beginnings of separation of church and state, which we take for granted,
1589660	1595740	but this is going to further drive the secularization of the culture, it's going to further drive
1595740	1604180	the secularization of the culture, because more and more people are experiencing that
1604180	1616420	sacred as something private, separate, secluded unto itself, separate from the state and politics
1616420	1627020	and of course also science and the university.
1627020	1634500	Now that not knowing who saved, of course, also brings with it terrific problems.
1634500	1639380	This was made into a classic argument, which has come under some criticism, but I think
1639380	1643540	the core insight is still a value by Max Weber.
1643540	1654940	The problem with Luther's model is there's nothing you can do to know that you're saved,
1654940	1659880	because there is nothing you can do to bring, you have no causal role, which means there's
1659880	1665820	no causal evidence, there's no evidence, how do you know if you're saved?
1665820	1671300	Because God chooses people arbitrarily.
1671300	1678020	So this provokes terrific anxiety, there's tremendous anxiety about whether or not you're
1678020	1679020	saved.
1679020	1683700	You have your own, and Luther gives you, there's this dramatic tension in Luther, he gives
1683700	1689140	you this double bind.
1689140	1693740	He tells you that what you ultimately have to rely on is your individual conscience,
1693740	1704740	but he tells you that that inner world is one of overwhelming self-deception.
1704740	1707260	And so what do you do with this anxiety?
1707260	1713980	Well, you can't do anything officially, but what you can do is you can work hard to make
1713980	1717220	your life good.
1717220	1724700	Because if you're succeeding in the world, especially socioeconomic success, that surely
1724700	1730860	is a sign that God has chosen you, that God loves you.
1730860	1736980	So what I'm going to do is I'm going to develop what becomes called the present work ethic.
1736980	1743340	Because my only way of knowing is this unofficial way, this relatively unconscious way of knowing
1743340	1747420	that I'm saved, is if I'm succeeding well, so I'm going to work hard to succeed.
1747420	1755900	And I'm not going to use my wealth in any way to promote myself.
1755900	1760100	I'm not going to do what would later be called conspicuous consumption, because that would
1760100	1763140	be a sign of pride.
1763140	1770060	So I work hard, and in order to avoid pride, I'm going to push the money, the wealth I
1770060	1771980	acquire back into my business.
1771980	1775220	I'm going to get the present work ethic.
1775220	1779500	And this is going to align so well with the emerging corporations.
1779500	1785340	We talked about the emerging ascendancy of the commercial class, and we get the advent
1785340	1789580	of capitalism.
1789580	1801460	As Weber's book famously puts it, the present work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.
1801460	1805060	And this worry is a real worry.
1805060	1809380	This is what you watch happen.
1809380	1815020	And what's amazing is how Luther was surprised by this.
1815020	1821020	For a man who is in many ways brilliant, he translates the Bible into German, by the way.
1821020	1826820	He makes the Bible readable for everybody because of the priesthood of all believers.
1826820	1828500	And he's a brilliant translator.
1828500	1834700	Many people consider him as one of the foundational figures of modern German.
1834700	1842060	But he honestly thought that everybody would read the Bible the same way he did.
1842060	1849060	So he thought we'd gotten rid of the Pope, but there would be a unifying thing that would
1849060	1852260	hold Christianity together, which is the idea of the Bible.
1852260	1856980	So the Bible becomes very holy, and many people have said that what Protestants have is a
1856980	1858460	paper pope.
1858460	1863220	The Bible takes the role for them that the pope does for the Catholic world.
1863220	1868900	And of course, we are facing struggles right now in our culture because we don't quite
1868900	1878780	know what to do with this terrible and awesome book, The Bible.
1878780	1887580	What shocked Luther and shouldn't shock us is that Protestantism quickly fragments because
1887580	1896900	when you give people no authority other than their own individual conscience, when you
1896900	1905080	separate them from any claims upon them of tradition, any claims upon them of history
1905080	1914700	or institution, any claims upon them of knowledge, the idea that they will all agree is actually
1914700	1917540	a ridiculous idea.
1917540	1925640	And so what happens and continues to happen to this very day is the huge and ongoing and
1925640	1931480	accelerating fragmentation of Protestantism into denomination after denomination after
1931480	1934480	denomination.
1934480	1940040	You get what has been called in other quarters, but can be applied here, the narcissism of
1940040	1946960	small difference, right?
1946960	1952920	You have to find that piece of evidence that shows that you are unique, that shows that
1952920	1962720	of all of the damned masses, God has elected you, your uniqueness, your specialness, your
1962720	1967080	unearned unique specialness has to be guaranteed.
1967080	1971520	And the more I'm like these other people, the more that comes into question.
1971520	1977600	So not only am I driven by my own radicalized subjectivity in my interpretation, I'm also
1977600	1985680	hungry for a mark of specialness for me that will show that I am saved.
1985680	1992520	And so the narcissism and the fragmentation of Protestantism walk, march, in lock, step
1992520	2001720	together, mutually accelerating.
2001720	2004360	So notice what's happened.
2004360	2015040	Take a look, you're getting, God is withdrawing, God's withdrawing.
2015040	2022960	By the time of Luther, God has become very much this arbitrary will in a world that is
2022960	2030040	nothing but a battle of wills.
2030040	2036160	Think about how not that long after Luther, you have Shakespeare.
2036160	2043640	Luther is the great writer of German, Shakespeare is the great writer of English.
2044040	2053000	Notice how somebody who is plumbing the depths of the human psyche, Shakespeare, in a way
2053000	2061600	that of course has struck most of us as perennially profound, how absent God is from that world
2061600	2063720	of Shakespeare.
2063720	2070680	There's supernaturals there, there are the witches in Macbeth, there are ghosts in Hamlet,
2070680	2081560	but God is not ever present and the supernatural is absurd and arbitrary and largely an agent
2081560	2092880	of chaos and a destiny that thwarts people in their endeavors.
2092880	2104280	It's telling how much God has withdrawn into being an arbitrary, absurd supernatural agency
2104280	2113080	that largely thwarts and undermines human activities.
2113080	2122280	So the Protestant Reformation is fundamental to our grammar of how we understand ourselves
2122280	2129880	and the problem is even though many of us are children of the secularization that is
2129880	2135000	accelerated by the Protestant Reformation, we still carry that grammar around in our
2135000	2136000	head.
2136000	2144360	We have to work hard, we have to work very hard and if we don't work hard, it's going
2144360	2150400	to be revealed how worthless we are.
2150400	2156560	And that we hunger for that unearned positive regard.
2156560	2166720	We need to find that mark of our uniqueness that shows that we are chosen from the damned
2166720	2171880	and that we will not disappear into nothingness and meaninglessness, but instead we will be
2171880	2180320	adored for simply who we are.
2181320	2190640	Now, all of these factors, the scientific revolution, the advent of the beginnings of
2190640	2198360	capitalism, especially corporate capitalism, and the Protestant Reformation are all mutually
2198360	2204840	reinforcing each other, they're giving people tremendous anxiety.
2204840	2208760	So the scientific revolution is basically cutting you off from the world and the Protestant
2208760	2214920	Reformation is basically offending you from the mother church and tradition and history.
2214920	2219920	Look, you have to bear it all.
2219920	2226640	You alone, by yourself, you have to bear it all while simultaneously being told you don't
2226640	2234680	have the resources or the capacity within you to do it.
2234680	2242320	There are nothing that has to bear it all.
2242320	2248280	You cut off from the world, you cut off from reality, behind illusion, there's a restless
2248280	2258000	battle of wills, you cut off from wisdom institutions with sapiential obsolescence.
2258000	2264440	So this is a time of a lot of existential dread.
2264440	2273960	You see the very thoughtful response of people like Pascal, who is now experiencing the cosmos
2273960	2276440	not as a cosmos.
2276440	2281460	Remember what cosmos means, a beautiful order that we can participate in and that will afford
2281460	2282960	our self-transcendence.
2282960	2289520	No, Pascal, who's a mathematical genius, he gets the new math, he looks out at the cosmos
2289520	2297240	and he says, those infinite spaces terrify me.
2297240	2300960	The cosmos is now cold and terrifying.
2300960	2307440	Its vastness is inhuman and crippling of the human spirit.
2307440	2324640	There's an individual who arises at the same time and wants to address this anxiety.
2324640	2330960	And we'll talk about the comparison between Pascal and this person.
2330960	2332880	This person's Rene Descartes.
2332880	2341000	Descartes wants to take this grammar of the scientific revolution about math as the marker
2341000	2348280	of reality and he wants to use it to come up with, on his own, like a good Protestant,
2348280	2351640	although he's Catholic, but on his own, from his own individual consciousness.
2351640	2355480	He wants to come up on his own, forget the history, forget the tradition.
2355480	2356480	This is Descartes.
2357080	2368840	I'm going to use the new math to come up with a solution to this emerging meaning crisis.
2368840	2372920	Descartes is a genius.
2372920	2380320	And what he does is he invents a new psychotechnology, one of the most powerful psychotechnologies,
2380320	2384960	a psychotechnology that has been so internalized into our culture and our cognition that it
2384960	2386460	is almost transparent to us.
2386460	2394540	We do not realize it is the lens by which we see and understand the world.
2394540	2397260	Descartes liked to sleep in.
2397260	2403400	It's probably led to his death because when he had to go to Sweden, they didn't let him
2403400	2408520	sleep in and he had to go out in the cold air and that's probably what led to his death.
2408520	2412280	So he liked to sleep in.
2412280	2417300	So one day he's laying in bed and it was the fashion at the time, the architectural fashion,
2417300	2420620	further to be tiling on the floor and tiling on the walls.
2420620	2423340	There's a fly flying around the room.
2423340	2426740	Now, for most of us, that's where we, that's, that's it.
2426740	2428860	That's all we get, fly in a room.
2428860	2434380	But Descartes notes that if he, he noted that if he counts the number of tiles along, right,
2434380	2439820	these three axes, he can come up with three numbers that will plot wherever the fly is
2439820	2442680	in the room.
2442680	2455320	Descartes invents Cartesian graphing, the system we use today, the XYZ system.
2455320	2463440	He takes the new algebra, the new way in which, right, the new way in which Galileo had been
2463440	2466600	using math and he pushes it even further.
2466600	2470620	He invents graphing.
2470620	2475660	And what, what psychotechnology, because that's what it is.
2475660	2479820	This is a standardized strategy.
2479820	2485460	Learn from your society, a socialized, standardized strategy for information processing.
2485460	2494700	What psychotechnology more means science to you than a graph.
2495240	2499000	When I can make a graph, I'm doing science.
2499000	2503680	When I can think graphically, I'm thinking scientifically.
2503680	2511520	This is one of the most powerful and pervasive psychotechnologies, and he invents it.
2511520	2518640	And this brings with it a powerful idea, because he invents analytic geometry.
2518640	2529500	Any geometrical shape can be converted into an algebraic equation.
2529500	2541260	Equations capture reality, because, remember what Galileo has done, math doesn't have to
2541260	2547860	look like, it doesn't have to share the same gestalt as what it's representing.
2547860	2550920	That has now been taken to its fulfillment in Descartes.
2550920	2559640	Equations are not in any way like what they represent, but nevertheless, following up
2559640	2566080	on Copernicus and Galileo, they are what cut through illusion into reality.
2566080	2570680	Now this is a radical idea.
2570680	2575200	Because of graphing and analytic geometry, we get this idea that we can grasp the world
2575200	2576320	with equations.
2576320	2585620	So you think that this captures something deep about the world, E equals MC squared,
2585620	2588780	and you should.
2588780	2594420	Because when you really understand this, you can take a paperclip worth of matter, and
2594420	2604340	you can smash a city to the ground, men and women, like gods.
2604340	2612200	It's intoxicating the power that it puts at our fingertips.
2612200	2620900	It seems to provide overwhelming evidence that this way of thinking puts us deeply in
2620900	2624980	touch with the fiber and fabric of reality.
2624980	2632280	We are fundamentally in contact, but it's not a contact of experience.
2632280	2634380	It's not the Aristotelian conformity.
2634380	2636700	It's not participatory.
2636700	2638900	It is purely propositional.
2638900	2640940	It is purely abstract.
2640940	2647220	It is purely symbolic.
2647220	2659020	Now that's going to bring with it a radical idea.
2659020	2667280	Descartes thinks, well you know what, this is how I can understand the meaning crisis.
2667280	2671360	All this anxiety, he didn't of course call it the meaning crisis, so that's anachronistic
2671360	2672360	on my part.
2672360	2678720	But I'm putting words into his mouth so that we can talk to him across space and time.
2678720	2679920	There's all this anxiety.
2679920	2682120	There's all this sense of disconnection.
2682120	2701620	So Descartes understands the meaning crisis as a lack of a search for certainty.
2701620	2710860	Conformity in the Aristotelian, the Neoplatonic sense, participatory, perspectival conformity
2710860	2718360	has been replaced by propositional certainty.
2718360	2721960	And of course the thing about math for Descartes is it gives you certainty.
2721960	2728760	That's why math cuts through all the illusions.
2728760	2739480	That's why it allows us access to such power.
2739480	2750580	So Descartes thinks the answer to the crisis is to transform our minds, not in any kind
2750580	2760060	of spiritual transformation, but to transform our minds into machines of certainty.
2760060	2769720	Equations that will only work mathematically and logically in terms of equations.
2769720	2778320	The way to get certainty is to turn myself into a machine that represents the world to
2778320	2786480	abstract symbolic propositions and then manipulate those propositions in a purely logical mathematical
2786480	2789680	function.
2790100	2801380	What Descartes is proposing is that the way to address the anxiety of the age is for each
2801380	2809020	one of us to adopt a method that will turn us into computers.
2809020	2814020	That's what a computer is.
2814020	2818040	Computer is originally a word applied to people, by the way.
2818040	2822200	In the 1930s or 40s, you could have a job as a computer.
2822200	2831080	If that was your job, you would be given the task of taking equations and processing them
2831080	2836840	in a logical mathematical fashion.
2836840	2842600	So reasoning is being reduced to computation.
2842620	2848700	We'll talk about what that might mean in a minute.
2848700	2856060	The idea is if we can make our minds into purely computational machines, then we will
2856060	2858500	achieve certainty.
2858500	2867260	Certainty in our beliefs will give us what Descartes thinks we need in order to alleviate
2867260	2869300	the anxiety that we're suffering.
2869320	2875880	Of course, we do that, right?
2875880	2881960	On one hand, we have the cultural grammar of Luther and the narcissism and the radical
2881960	2882960	self-doubt.
2882960	2887000	On the other hand, we have the Cartesian grammar.
2887000	2889880	We seek certainty.
2889880	2893040	We won't believe anything until it's certain.
2893040	2897680	Of course, we vacillate between, I must accept it without any evidence or reason, Luther.
2897740	2903340	I can only accept it if it's absolutely certain and beyond question, Descartes.
2903340	2908180	And both of these, of course, are pathological.
2908180	2914060	The first is pathological because if you completely remove people's agency in how they come to
2914060	2922180	their beliefs, then you radically undermine any meaning in life they might possess.
2922180	2924980	The other one, the pursuit of certainty.
2924980	2930440	And there are individuals who seem to speak as if mathematical science will still give
2930440	2931560	us certainty.
2931560	2932560	That's an illusion.
2932560	2938200	Part of what we discover after Descartes, and Descartes was also surprised in that people
2938200	2947720	ended up disagreeing with him, is that science doesn't and can't provide certainty.
2947720	2950360	These two equations I put up on the board.
2950360	2952440	This is from Einstein.
2952440	2954280	This is from Newton.
2954280	2959660	What Einstein showed is things that Newton thought were certain, absolute space and time,
2959660	2966100	these kinds of formula, actually don't possess the certainty that Newton thought they did.
2966100	2976220	We'll talk a little bit later about why we can't accept in very limited context.
2976220	2981460	There are deep, deep reasons why we can't pursue certainty.
2981460	2990120	And therefore we can't seek certainty as a solution to loss of connection, connection
2990120	2994400	to our self, connection to the world, connection to other minds.
2994400	3000680	Now, why does Descartes, again this radical irony, very similar to Luther, why does Descartes
3000680	3010720	attempt to address this burgeoning loss of connections?
3010720	3017300	What does it actually result in exactly the opposite, increased sense of disconnectedness?
3017300	3023140	Part of it, of course, is the failure of the project of certainty.
3023140	3033340	You can understand the 18th and the 19th, and especially the 20th centuries as scientific,
3033340	3040280	historical, and philosophical undermining of the idea that we can achieve certainty.
3040280	3051280	Of course, one of the great principles of modern physics is the uncertainty principle.
3051280	3052280	But let's go back.
3052280	3060800	So Descartes proposes that we should do this, but there's an individual at his time who's
3060800	3068860	a contemporary of Descartes, who makes it explicit and radical, and then challenges
3068860	3073500	Descartes with that radical derivation.
3073500	3081900	Hobbes says, well, you know, all of this, what this means is that cognition is computation.
3081900	3086180	Hobbes says that, he uses an older word, he says, rathiosination, what we would now say
3086180	3087180	is cognition.
3087180	3089780	By rathiosination I mean computation.
3089800	3091680	Computation is computation.
3091680	3102520	Now, there's a lot of people who were going to disagree with this model of computation.
3102520	3107400	There's a lot of discussion right now, Brian Cantwell-Smith, a colleague of mine at the
3107400	3111840	University of Toronto, does a lot of important work on the metaphysics of computation.
3111840	3115200	I am not trying to state that this is the absolute truth about computation.
3115200	3118080	That, of course, would be ironic, given what I just said about certainty.
3118100	3121740	All I am arguing is, historically, this has been the interpretation of what computation
3121740	3124340	was for people like Descartes and Hobbes.
3124340	3126860	That's all we need for this argument.
3126860	3129300	But Hobbes says, cognition is computation.
3129300	3132300	And then here's the radical idea he proposes.
3132300	3139660	He takes a new idea, current at the time, remember the idea that matter is a substance.
3139660	3145780	Remember the old Aristotelian idea is matter is pure potential, but with Galileo, matter
3145800	3149320	is a reality, right, in the sense of a substance.
3149320	3154080	It resists, and it's good that it resists because I need something that resists my will
3154080	3156800	in order to help me with my biases.
3156800	3163960	So matter is inert, it's resistance, it's really there, I push on it.
3163960	3171600	Notice that again, all that's left of conformity is resistance of will.
3171600	3192220	Hobbes says, well, matter is real, and what if I built a material machine
3192220	3200500	that did computation?
3200500	3206120	If cognition is just computation, and I can build a machine that does computation, and
3206120	3210960	some of the first automatic machines are being built at this time, calculating machines,
3210960	3218920	if I can make a material machine that does computation, I will have made cognition.
3218920	3220680	I will have made mine.
3220680	3228320	Right there, at the heart of the scientific revolution, Hobbes is proposing artificial
3228320	3232020	intelligence.
3232020	3247740	Notice how artificial intelligence is a child of the advent of the meaning crisis and the
3247740	3248900	scientific revolution.
3248900	3251740	It's not a modern idea.
3251740	3256100	Artificial intelligence goes back to this time.
3256480	3261720	What is Hobbes doing with this?
3261720	3270000	I said Galileo kills the universe and Copernicus kills the reality of our sense experience,
3270000	3276960	but Hobbes is doing something way more personal because up till now, you've been isolated
3276960	3280760	inside your own mind, but at least still there.
3280760	3286080	I still have something special, unique, something spiritual.
3286100	3294620	Hobbes kills the soul, no soul, because if artificial intelligence is right, if I can
3294620	3300820	build a machine, purely material machine that is capable of computation, then I will have
3300820	3311580	made a mind and I didn't have to involve any soul stuff, any spirit stuff in making it.
3311580	3313580	And that's radical.
3313600	3320360	Take a look at how Descartes responds to that and how deep that response is woven into our
3320360	3330000	culture and the meaning crisis and how we move between AI and Descartes even today.
3330000	3331360	Thank you very much for your time and attention.
