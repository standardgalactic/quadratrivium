0	4680	Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Ravik.
4680	12560	I'm very excited about this because my good friend and long time interlocutor and philosophical
12560	18880	partner in crime and all the other wonderful epithet we might give to each other is back.
18880	22400	And we're going to have a series of discussions about a very important topic.
22400	24880	And of course, I'm talking about Jordan Hall.
25360	28960	Jordan, it's so great to be with you here again.
28960	30640	And I want you to take some time.
33600	36480	Everybody should know we sort of talked about this before off-camera.
36480	39280	We've got some ideas about basic architecture.
39280	42640	And Jordan's going to propose that, run through it,
42640	45440	and then we'll enter into a more of a dialogical format.
45440	48000	So Jordan, please take it away.
48000	49360	Thank you.
49360	50160	I'm just putting this on.
50160	50960	Do not disturb.
50960	58320	OK, so the topic here, I think last time we talked about it, we pinned the name,
58320	65200	the Neo-Neocortex, or a new form or a new approach to the problem of governance.
66320	73200	And when we talked last time, what I noticed was that I've been running into this particular
73920	82880	territory from a variety of distinct subgroups, subdomains, both different areas
82880	86400	of kind of an intellectual endeavor, but also completely different communities
86400	90400	that in some sense don't even consider themselves to have any real relationship with each other.
91600	97600	And yet, this problem of proper governance in a particularly new fashion
98560	104000	ends up being a bit of a Venn diagram where they're beginning to converge.
104000	107040	And I think increasingly self-aware.
107040	109760	So let me just list a couple of what these domains look like.
109760	115200	And you'll notice that they are, many of them will look at the problem differently.
115200	122000	So for example, the OG, the original point that brought us here was actually your own thing,
122000	124480	the various projects that you're now bringing into the world,
124560	128000	and the conversations I was having with Ryan, correct?
129680	133520	About the particular problem of governance is being central to...
133520	134720	Ryan Barton.
134720	135520	Ryan Barton, right.
135520	140720	Yeah, how do we give rise to a new form of collaboration around the question of,
141280	144560	for example, bringing embodied wisdom more fully into the world?
144560	150560	And how do we do this in a fashion where many of the things that we know just consistently
150560	153280	plague any kind of new institution don't happen?
153280	154240	Like, we'd like to avoid that.
154240	159680	We'd like to preemptively design something where capture, malincentive,
159680	166480	or becoming centralized in a single individual don't occur.
168080	173200	But other places, in the technical world, the space known as DAOS,
174080	179440	which is a piece of the kind of the emerging crypto blockchain universe,
180080	183920	are now very deeply focused on this question of what does proper governance look like?
183920	186640	Now, they may think of it as DAO governance, but my point is,
186640	188640	it's actually looking at a new form of governance.
188640	190560	So I'll get into some detail on that in a moment.
192080	198400	And another individual named Balaji Srinivasan has, I think, pretty well put a stake in the
198400	204160	ground around the thing he's calling network states, which he specifically positions as being
206080	214400	a next step beyond the nation state, and in particular, call for a new form of governance.
216000	217120	And then we'll shift.
217120	222720	So if we're looking at, say, ordinary politics, we can look at some of the problems that are
222720	228560	in the space of the increasing polarization that seems to be happening across the Western world,
229280	236240	and is, in many ways, locked in to the actual design, the underlying architecture of how we
236240	243280	run government produces, invariably, polarization, has a very hard time dealing with polarization.
244960	248800	And so a new form of governance is being called for a look at in those worlds as well.
248800	250000	And I mean, actually, practically.
250640	257520	We can also look at the problem of geopolitics and what looks like the shift of the world,
257520	264240	and from a single hegemonic mono superpower into an increasingly multipolar world,
264800	270320	which we don't really know how to do that, particularly in the context of things like
271600	276400	escalating technological capability, where we can't solve interstate conflicts with
276640	284720	escalating kinetic military conflict, and in the context of an entirely new form of war
284720	288640	called unrestricted warfare, which I'll just flag for those who understand that.
288640	295280	And my kind of cutting edge of investigation of both the multipolar geopolitics
295280	301280	and the notion of unrestricted warfare is also looking at what are new forms of governance
301280	303520	that can respond to this category of problem.
304000	311040	And then shifting again, in the age of Elon, questions around platforms, social media,
311040	314880	in his case, and particularly Twitter, we can think about Facebook and Instagram,
314880	323360	where we recognize that the governance principles like free speech aren't robust enough to respond.
323360	327680	For example, just a simple notion that because Twitter is a private company,
327680	332000	the kind of the juridical principles of freedom of speech in the United States
332240	336320	have a hard time grasping it, and yet clearly it has a very profound role to play
336320	339920	in how the thing called free speech plays out in our polity.
339920	347280	And in fact, Elon has particularly called or pointed towards the direction of Twitter
347280	350960	as a foundation for a new form of collective intelligence.
351840	358640	And so if we can think about how the neo-neocortex and notions like distributed cognition
358640	368160	are related, you can see how there's a grope in that in the direction of a new form of governance.
368960	374080	And I got two more. The groups of individuals that have been looking at how do we tackle the
374080	378960	problem of planetary scale governance. And this includes that whole category of things
378960	385520	that we've talked about, hyper-objects, where the kind of nation-state on steroids,
385520	388880	the international structure like the IMF and the UN,
390720	395680	which was the best the mid-century could pull off, clearly aren't able to deal with planetary
395680	399840	scale governance problems. We again are finding ourselves having to think about
399840	406800	what might a new appropriate form of governance look like. And the last one I'll throw into the mix
407600	413760	is the AI alignment problem, which might feel weird. I mean, I don't mean this necessarily
413760	417040	from the point of view of sort of how do we build a department of AI alignment
417040	423520	as a kind of a regulatory institution. What might we ever, under any circumstances,
423520	430560	put in place that could actually do that job? And I'll get into some detail about
430560	435680	how that plays out in a moment. So that's an example of the diversity of different domains
436240	440240	and the different kinds of groups, many of whom don't believe they're in the same space,
440240	447520	that I personally am spending time with, that this question of what is a novel form of proper
447520	453840	governance, both in terms of its potential and in some sense in terms of its necessity, bring up.
455840	464160	So this is an instance of what Arlen calls problem finding. And one way of understanding that,
464160	470240	one interpretation I've given that is, you have a bunch of problems that seem disparate,
471200	476960	and then you find a core central problem. And children seem to demonstrate this when they
476960	481360	go through developmental stages, you find a core central problem, that if you solve that core
481360	487120	central problem, all these other problems will be significantly either solved or reformulated
487120	491040	in a powerful and insightful manner. You know, I've had to do something like that with my work
491040	496320	on relevance realization, sort of the found problem underneath all these other, what seemed
496320	501440	like disparate problems in categorization, etc. So it sounds to me like you're proposing that kind
501440	506560	of thing, that like, here's a bunch of things that seem disparate. But if you write, they intersect
506560	511760	at this core problem, and if this course problem gets addressed, it will systemically and systematically
511760	516400	feed out to the other problems and bring about a very comprehensive change.
517200	522240	Yes, yes, I think that's exactly right. And what it would look like from the inside for some of
522240	528160	these particular domains would be a kind of a different way of looking at the whole problem
528160	532560	that they're looking at, which would resolve a gordian knot, for example.
532560	536400	Yes, yes, yes. And facilitate coordination between the groups too.
537120	542720	Exactly, quite to the point, which in many cases might avoid some catastrophes that happen when
542800	549040	they're unconsciously coordinating, for example, AI and unrestricted warfare. And this is a situation
549040	553040	where they're implicitly coordinating in a negative way, and we'd actually like to invert that
553040	559360	relationship. And so, to the point there, something that I think also comes up in this
559360	567120	kind of conversation is that, for me at least, this investigation is not a kind of a question of
567920	574080	a progressive effort to just make a better kind of governance. And it's certainly not even vaguely
574080	579200	utopian. In some senses, it's almost the exact inverse. It's just more a question of necessity
579200	586400	and timing. My sense of things is just we happen to be here. We're in a moment where there are
586400	592640	profound changes that are afoot, and that if existing global institutions and existing forms
592640	597440	of governance could in fact provide adequate governance to allow us to navigate these problems,
597440	602320	then we should just do that. But it's only in fact because they don't, that we're going to have to
602320	609200	take this sort of step. So that's the dose of practicality that I think is important if you're
609200	617760	going to step into this space. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to drop two big conceptual
617760	622320	frameworks that I personally have talked about in the past, but it's been a while. And I don't
622320	628880	think, I think it's worth kind of articulating them in a little bit of detail, both to help frame
628880	633680	the nature of the transition to the shift, and also to begin creating the,
635440	638320	funny, I think of it as the phase space or the vector diagram of what the
639040	648000	kind of the proper solution looks like. So the first one is the, I guess, the philosophical
648080	653120	or the theoretical framework of media studies, and particularly McLuhan.
654240	659280	So here, one way of looking at things is to say that we're currently living in a world
659280	666800	that is in many ways a result of literacy, of writing, that we are living in the era of literacy.
666800	673040	And if we can think about the kinds of shifts that have occurred, and both in terms of kind
673360	681280	rate and comprehensivity, it helps us get, I think, both a sense of how we got to where we are
681280	686560	and also what it will look like by necessity as we're going to where we're going. So the first
686560	691760	point would be something like, if we wind the clock back to the medieval world, and we drop
691760	698480	ourselves into 1440 in the Gutenberg press, and then we identify changes that occur. And I'm going
698480	702560	to say at the level of governance, and this might bring up some questions about what I've
702560	709440	been mean by that term, but things like the Protestant Revolution and things like the
709440	716240	Thirty Years' War. And there was a fundamental shift of the infrastructure of governance in
716240	721440	the eruption of Protestantism, which I, in this case, will propose was at least meaningfully attached
721440	732160	to the rise of literacy or the written book, which then itself presaged, but also combined with the
732160	737920	implications of literacy in the more political domain, and this gave rise to the Thirty Years'
737920	744080	War. But other domains like the emergence of the Royal Society, which could only happen when
744080	749920	people were literate, and people who could write were sharing written works with each other,
749920	754240	and could be engaging in the peer-to-peer collaborative discovery of the nature of
754240	761280	reality in a very different fashion. And I would point even more pointedly to the emergence of
763120	768960	the shift of the Constitution, and the fact that we now live in a world that is profoundly
768960	773680	constitutional from the throughout the 19th century. And of course, as a result of two
773680	781120	major world wars, most of the world is now living in a form of government that is founded in a
781120	789040	written document, a constitution, which is unconsciously, I think in many ways, simply a
789040	794800	consequence of thinking that that's the proper way to do things. One aspect of which, by the way,
794800	800800	is the Napoleonic Code. And I was looking at some conversations recently coming out of Africa where
801360	805840	we're talking about the fact that the efforts of the Napoleonic Code, which is a governance by
805840	812160	proposition, don't work very well. And that the countries that found themselves subject to that
812160	817280	form of governance have not fared as well as those who were able to operate using the common law,
817280	824720	which I would say is governance by participatory relationship. And which, by the way, connected
824720	831200	with their indigenous governance methodologies upon getting back. And then finally, just to make
831200	836080	sure the space of the scope of what we're talking about is rolled in, the notion of corporations
836080	841840	and things like the British East India Company, which in many ways, both were built on top of and
841840	848480	massively innovated the technologies of bureaucracy, which of course is the training people to be
848480	854960	literate and then taking those literate people to run a global empire on the basis of what is
854960	861600	effectively handwritten letters and accounting systems. And so this is a story that talks about
861600	867920	the notion of governance and its very shape and scope and how it rolled out over about 500 years.
867920	875280	And then the point is to say, we're now well into the era of the digital. And the digital is different
875280	883040	fundamentally and has profound implications for that same set of scopes. And I would expand,
883040	887200	by the way, to include down deep into the basis of how we produce the notion of individuals.
887200	893600	So it's a psychological question, as well as an institutional question. And one inquiry that
893600	896720	we'll be running into when we ask this question of what is the new form of governance? What is the
896720	901440	neo-New York Cortex? What is the new set of literacies and the new forms of generative grammar,
902160	906720	as well as what are the new forms of institution and the new forms of structures?
908080	913520	And we'll be guided by thinking about what are the implications of the essence of the shift of
913520	919840	digital and how that might help us better understand what are the likely kind of laminar flows or the
919840	925520	downhill directionality. Digital is going to be driving us in a certain direction, which may simply
925760	930720	by the way, the release of some of the consequences of writing or literacy,
932080	937120	that'll help us understand better. So I'll return to that when we get past the next big
937120	941840	conceptual chunk. Does all that track so well so far? Yeah, I just wanted to ask what else is
941840	948080	included. I mean, I get the argument, and of course, the literacy argument starts in the axial
948080	952800	revolution, and then you get the introduction of punctuation, and then you get the Carolingian
952800	959600	script, and it ramps up, and it ramps up, and it ramps up. And then as you say, you get the
959600	964160	Protestant Reformation, and you get the possibility of the Scientific Revolution, and then of course,
964160	971440	the Thirty Years' War. And then, attendant to that, and to me, this is part of the emergence of the
971440	981120	idea of the self-constituting state, the social contracting state that contracts itself into
981120	988400	existence through a written contract, that's what a constitution basically is, is dependent on
988400	994720	one of the major consequences of the Thirty Years' War, which is the acceleration of secularism,
994720	1002880	the acceleration of the separation of church and state, the making of religion private,
1002880	1009200	in a way that cuts us off from all of our previous history in a really profound way,
1010160	1016400	so that a lot of the other ways in which authority, which I take to be the fundamental
1016400	1022080	capacity for governance, is determined. So there were many other ways in which authority was
1022080	1029280	determined, and then they get reduced, I would say, via secularism to the notion of the social
1029280	1037920	contract as typified, as you said. So the authorities accrue to written text, that's why you have to
1038000	1044880	sign your name, so the written text and the sacred becomes to be associated with the sacred,
1044880	1050240	the scriptures, the writings, more and more and more in the Protestant revolution,
1050240	1060880	solar scriptura. And so you get that and the social contract, and that's the only basis for
1060880	1065360	any authority, there's no other basis for authority, whereas there used to be things
1066000	1077520	reasonably like tradition, religion, kinship systems, all kinds of things that limited
1078400	1083920	the political economic enterprises that human beings engage in. All of those are basically
1083920	1090000	removed. Well, I'm not saying they're removed completely, but they're denuded, they're diminished,
1090080	1095440	they're demarcated off. Does that track is also part of what you're talking about?
1096080	1104880	Absolutely. In fact, perfectly. Yeah, in fact, let me just move into the next piece,
1104880	1109280	because there's so many different directions. Let me hold this, but there's something about,
1109280	1113920	so I'm now going to take a skew or a bleak look that cuts through the frame
1114880	1120720	and in many ways, producing some really interesting synergies. So this has to do with that whole
1123520	1127440	framework of complexity and the complicated. Right. Yes.
1130400	1133120	I'm tempted to sort of immediately riff, but I'll try to stay a little bit more
1133760	1139360	rigorous for a moment. So, you know, as you know, this is a distinction. In my experience, I learned
1139520	1145360	from Dave Snowden, although I spent enough time at the Santa Fe Institute to drink
1145360	1149520	of the well of complexity directly. But the notion that complicated was definitely
1150640	1155440	from him, from me. And the distinction, I think, is very profound. I would say in a particular way,
1157120	1164000	it looks like a little bit of the classic map territory distinction, where the territory,
1164000	1170800	the complex is fundamental. It is just sort of what's there. It's reality. And then the complicated
1170800	1179440	is a thing that humans can do. We can create a model and we can control or we can foreground
1179440	1184640	certain aspects of the complex by virtue of creating certain technologies. And I'll get into
1185200	1190240	an example of what I mean about that in a moment. And then we can endeavor to do things like optimize
1190240	1196240	for or optimize against to exclude aspects of that system. So agriculture is a classic example.
1196240	1201920	You say, well, I want a whole lot of wheat. And I'm going to be able to create a control system
1201920	1209200	by virtue of certain technologies like a plow and irrigation and pesticides and just the practice
1209200	1214800	of understanding that wheat seeds produce wheat plants. And therefore have a much larger yield
1214800	1218800	of wheat in a certain territory of land than would happen in a fashion that is
1221200	1226560	how nature would do it. So that's the kind of the ticket. And what's interesting here in this
1226560	1233920	distinction is that in some sense, neither Kuhn nor Tainter use this particular framework. And
1233920	1238720	yet if you use this framework, you could say that they're both, they both looked at this problem
1239920	1244000	in completely different ways, right? Kuhn was looking at scientific paradigms,
1244000	1247520	both in terms of how they manifested in the psychologists of scientists
1247520	1251200	and in how they manifested in the institutions of science. But nonetheless,
1251200	1257760	he was investigating or diagnosing how complicated systems, paradigms, played out
1258400	1263440	in both in terms of how they developed, how they responded to the problematic that the map is
1263440	1268320	never fully the territory. And as the territory changes, or as the needs of the map change,
1268320	1272560	if you're stuck with trying to make the map work, you end up with a occlusion problem.
1273360	1277680	And the challenge of actually what happens when psychologists lose the fact that they're
1277680	1283280	actually using maps and then mistake it for the territory. And then the flip side is that Tainter
1283280	1286640	was looking at it from the point of view of anthropology, trying to discover why it was
1286640	1290880	that civilizations collapsed, he called them complex societies. I would say that he was
1290880	1295520	properly discussing the collapse of complicated societies, and frankly looked at a lot of the
1295520	1301680	same kinds of dynamics. And so that tells us something that we are sitting in, yet another,
1301680	1308000	complicated society that has a marriage to a particular set of paradigms. And both from a
1308000	1315120	Tainter analysis and a Coonian analysis, all the signs point to we're reaching the end of that.
1315120	1320960	And the inquiry in now is we would look like to try to consciously develop something,
1320960	1327200	which is no longer simply unconsciously instantiating another form of complicated governance
1327200	1331600	system, another kind of complicated society on top of it, which we may find ourselves doing
1331680	1336960	willy-nilly, but it'd be wise if we could be more careful about it. But is there a way of actually
1336960	1342000	creating a principled return? I'm going to use the word return specifically to the complex.
1342000	1347600	So I'll give you an example. And I think you've made just pointed to it, which makes it collaborative.
1349840	1357200	For a long time, certainly for the past couple of hundred years, we've been living with a
1357200	1364000	false dichotomy between the state and the market as fundamental grounds of ways that
1364000	1370880	societies can govern choices. And so we can either turn the dial way up via highly authoritarian,
1372320	1378640	totalitarian, bureaucratic governance system, where there's an effort or an intent to govern
1378640	1385760	choices to a very fine-grained level by virtue of complicated bureaucracies to be very straightforward.
1386320	1391120	And I would propose, by the way, at this moment, a theoretical level that
1393680	1402400	if I take the notion of the virtual or the notion of the capacity at all, the basic human
1402400	1408000	capacity to do this thing, to create an abstraction, to create a model, to produce something in the
1408000	1413600	realm of the virtual and then a map, and then use that to feed back on, to engage in niche
1413600	1418800	construction on nature. So I'm proposing that that's a thing that we can do, and then, of course,
1418800	1425200	that we do do, that it splits, in some sense, down the middle in a very interesting way.
1425200	1432800	And one side of that split is the state, the realm of design, the realm of the model,
1433440	1441120	the realm of cybernetic command and control systems, and to the degree to which we're investing
1441120	1446400	that with authority and responsibility, we find ourselves in all the various kind of failure
1446400	1452080	conditions that have been explored by those who critique the state as a form. For example,
1452080	1456960	it's its limited capacity and it's limited bandwidth, and therefore, it's, you know,
1456960	1462480	calculation problems, as an example. Now, here's the interesting piece for me. I would say that
1462480	1469520	exact same move, that move of abstraction, also gives rise to the other side of the equation,
1469520	1472960	which right now just characterizes the market, but broadly what I mean is,
1473840	1477760	and I think this is, I'm just throwing this out there, but I think it's, it will prove a very
1477760	1486960	interesting proposition, which is, if I take our indigenous capacities, our ordinary human
1486960	1497040	capacities to engage in governance unconsciously, you know, the things that we just did for hundreds
1497600	1501120	of thousands, if not millions of years, but certainly hundreds of thousands of years,
1503040	1509520	in adaptive response to our natural environment. And then what we do is we inject the consequence
1510240	1514880	of complicatedness, which is to say we inject the consequence of technology,
1514880	1519120	whether this is physical technology or psychotechnologies, cultural technologies into the,
1519120	1527680	into the mix. What we get is a random walk of our overwhelmed indigenous governance capacities,
1528400	1534000	trying to navigate a landscape of accelerating innovation. Does that make sense?
1534000	1540000	Yes, it does. Yes. And so this is the other problem. This is sometimes been talked about
1540000	1544640	as the MOLOC problem, but I would say that quite fundamentally, it has to do with the fact, the
1544640	1554160	premise, that our existing baseline indigenous governance capacities, which actually do a very
1554160	1565200	fine job of navigating free paleolithic environmental niches, find themselves struggling
1565200	1571200	precisely because their output, the technological consequences of those capacities, change the
1571280	1576080	context that they're endeavoring to govern in a fashion that overwhelms those governance capacities.
1576080	1582080	And this is the problematic of the market. Now, the meta problem is that we've found ourselves
1582080	1586720	back into the corner of forgetting that these are two versions of the same basic thing.
1587600	1593520	They both are versions of the complicated and that the effort to govern the failures of the
1593520	1598880	market by means of the state or to govern the failures of the state by the liberations of the
1598880	1606720	market are not going to work, meaning that that actually is the limited area. It's the
1607440	1613600	false dichotomy that modernity has found itself stuck in the past 150 or 200 years or so.
1614240	1620080	And the proposition I would make is that it is, in fact, by virtue of the rediscovery of the third
1620080	1626560	term, which we've talked about is just the commons, the return of the commons, return to the complex,
1626560	1634880	but now at a higher tone with a clear cut mandate to be able to resolve this problem of, in fact,
1634880	1640800	specifically anthro complexity, resolve the problem of the fact that humans' capacity to
1640800	1646720	feedback on our environment itself is so significant that we have to actually apply that specifically
1646720	1651200	to the problem of governance so that our governance capacity is now equal to
1652160	1655200	our other technical capacities to change the natural environment.
1656480	1657920	Do that make any sense?
1658720	1661360	Yeah, but I'm going to ask some clarification questions.
1662640	1672640	So I'm trying to get at the, I guess, the crucial difference between complexity
1673200	1682000	and complicated, because it seems to me that any proposal for resolving the mismatch or the
1682000	1687120	misalignment between those two, which seems to be shared by both the proposal of the state
1687120	1692240	running things or the market running things, depends on getting very clear on that distinction.
1692240	1693840	Does that follow so far?
1694320	1695440	Yeah, that sounds great.
1695440	1701520	Okay, so now I'm hearing a couple of things that might be candidates,
1701520	1706320	but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not foisting any of these on you, I want to hear, right?
1706320	1711520	A one candidate might be, it might just be the, the, the, a simplistic one.
1711520	1715600	And I don't think you're saying this, you know, some, you can be saying something very trivial.
1716160	1720000	When you say the map isn't the territory, you can be saying something trivial like, well,
1720000	1723200	a representation is never identical to the thing it's represented.
1723280	1727120	And that's like, yeah, that's what makes it a representation, because if it was identical,
1727120	1729360	it would be an instance, not a representation.
1729360	1733040	And so you're not making a, I think, a logically trivial point like that.
1733040	1734480	You're trying to say something, no, though.
1734480	1738640	When I'm talking about, what I hear you saying is when I'm talking about complicated is there
1738640	1744960	can be any, they can be many variables and there can be many degrees of freedom,
1744960	1747520	but there is no fundamental uncertainty.
1747520	1753120	There may be risk, but risk is calculable and it does not possess genuine uncertainty.
1753120	1755520	This is a lot of the work I'm doing on rationality now.
1755520	1760720	In fact, this system, one of the ways the complex is equivocated into the complicated
1760720	1766160	is by redefining uncertainty as risk, which is precisely not what uncertainty is.
1766160	1770080	So you can have complicated and what you do is you do risk management.
1770160	1775680	Whereas the complex says there is actual uncertainty, which are
1778960	1782640	entities, process events, not captured by your variable.
1782640	1787440	And you're caught in a bias variance problem when you try to track them.
1787440	1792080	If you open up to too much sensitivity, you get overfitting.
1792080	1795200	And if you reduce your sensitivity, you get bias.
1795200	1799920	And there's no final solution to that, which means the uncertainties will always be
1800000	1805520	generative. There will always be creating emergent things that slam into your complicated system.
1805520	1808320	Is that a way of capturing it well?
1808960	1810960	Yes. That is a very good way of capturing it.
1810960	1816960	I'm laughing because I was preparing myself to try to respond to your question.
1816960	1819360	And as you kept going, I was like, I think you pretty much nailed it.
1819360	1822320	So yes, very much so.
1823120	1824560	Beautifully put. Thank you.
1824560	1834320	Right. And then that means a fundamental shift from monological management into
1834320	1837680	dialogical evolution. This is something you and I have talked about.
1838720	1843280	What we do is no, we've got this thing, this mono system, and it manages.
1843280	1848800	And we are like that. We are just monological reasoners.
1848800	1852720	And we manage. And then it's that monological management.
1852720	1860160	And then it's like, no, if, if complexity is not identical and can never be identified with
1860160	1865920	the complicated, whatever we have over here has to be constantly in a dialogical relationship
1865920	1870720	with that and constantly evolving in that relationship, as opposed to trying to monologically
1871280	1877040	manage reality. It's in a dialogical responsiveness evolution with reality.
1877040	1880480	Does that also part of what's following from this fight?
1880480	1883920	Yes, very much so. If you think about this in the context of something like AI,
1883920	1890080	it provides a nice kind of perspective to think about that, right? The, the notion that
1892320	1898800	you know, no kind of finite state machine is ever actually going to be able to
1899840	1905600	fully exhaust the generative possibility of emergent reality.
1906240	1910480	Yeah. The way I would put this is the complicated tries to pre-specify relevance
1911200	1916560	and it can't. Relevance is always within relevance realization, which is constantly evolving.
1918400	1928480	And I, and I think, and I think the problem with contracts and text and laws and rules is they
1928480	1932160	overestimate our capacity for pre-specifying relevance.
1932720	1938080	Exactly. And this, and this gets us, so for example, the distinction between common law
1938080	1943280	and civic civil code or Napoleonic code is precisely that, right? The Napoleonic code
1943280	1949200	in the classic hubris of the French Revolution, right? Because they, as you said, that notion
1949200	1953680	of a break, like they quite self-consciously said, we're making a complete break with all tradition.
1956480	1959600	I would say just made the error. They simply, you know, maybe didn't fully understand that
1959600	1963040	they were making a category error, but they made the category error of thinking that they could
1963840	1970480	fully prescribe a comprehensive code of law and write it down. And then all your early
1970480	1974480	job is to sort of look up on the lookup table. Oh, this is an example of that. And here's the
1974480	1978480	result, right? And, you know, the point is that's actually not a valid approach.
1980560	1986960	I want to emphasize that what happens is these things like constitutions function because of
1987040	1992400	implicit constraints of embeddedness that have not come into the explicit prescription.
1992400	1996960	For example, and Madison was very clear about this, the American constitution
1996960	2001440	depended on the size of the country and the speed at which communication could work
2001440	2008800	in order to it be effectively a counteract, the constitution to effectively counteract mob, right?
2008800	2016160	And so the size of the country and the slowness of communication were actually presupposed in
2016160	2021040	the functioning of the constitution. And those preconditions have now completely dissolved.
2021600	2027440	And yet, right, that doesn't mean the constitution has been in any important way updated to take
2027440	2034320	that loss of the preconditions, which are important enabling constraints into account.
2034880	2042320	Right. And to kind of push that, for example, a difference between literacy writing and digital
2042960	2051360	is the speed of computation. Yes. That notion of speed, like in the movement from 1776 to say
2051360	2059520	1976, cars and airplanes and telephones radically increased the speed of communication,
2059520	2066160	but infinitesimally compared to what happened post computation. Yes. Yes. So that's a sort of,
2066160	2070000	there's a difference that makes a difference that makes a difference that's landing now.
2070000	2077360	And the split or the drift between the fittedness of the enumeration of power,
2077360	2087200	the enumeration institution that was valid in 1776 is increasingly no longer valid
2087200	2092960	because of this kind of a difference. So I just want to take one historical lesson.
2093600	2101440	And I think it's your date 1776 is really wonderful because I see Vietnam, the war in Vietnam,
2101440	2110080	as the sort of realization is quite the right word, but the coming into the foreground of the
2110080	2114400	fact that the country could be reached in an almost simultaneous manner through television.
2114400	2119600	And therefore the political system and the political system almost breaks under the,
2119600	2126000	and then you have the attempt of the government to then do various ways of controlling and
2126000	2132080	centralizing the press. And then that gets blown apart again by the internet and cable and all that
2132080	2137520	stuff. Right. I'm just trying to give some concrete instances so people can track
2137520	2143200	the kind of thing we're talking about here. Yeah. It's useful, I would say, and maybe worth
2143200	2148080	doing the explication of these two different frameworks, the notion of the implications of
2148400	2156320	the media form on the possibility landscape of human choice and therefore the construct of
2156320	2163200	psychology and instrumental institution necessary to enable that choice to be flowing in a coherent
2163200	2168160	fashion, i.e. governance. And then the second category, right, this nation, this distinction
2168160	2173760	between the complicated and the complex. But let me move for a moment into something like
2174240	2178480	please some practical, some practical proposition. So given these frameworks,
2180400	2186400	what are some things that we might think about that are likely going to be part of the neo-neo
2186400	2192640	cortex? For example, what are the new literacies? What are the new, what might be the minimum viable
2192640	2198240	capacities embodied in humans, individual humans, in any form of new model of governance?
2198400	2205920	Let me just put a little bullet point on one, which is to say we're going to have to figure out the
2205920	2214000	proper role of technology. I think it's relatively obvious at this point that simply allowing technology
2214000	2219840	to be an unconscious producer of novelty governed effectively entirely by market and state,
2220560	2225440	poorly in both cases, is no longer adequate. We actually really have to think that one of
2225440	2231840	the primary questions that the neo-neo cortex needs to address is the proper role of technology.
2233200	2239680	And I'd like to point out a few interesting qualities here that I'm not sure are sort of
2241680	2246960	properly considered or fully considered in most discourse. One of the consequences of the era
2246960	2254400	of literacy was one of the negative consequences of the era of literacy was that it had this
2254480	2262080	consequence of converting humans into mediocre machines. And most of the infrastructure of
2262080	2270000	education, frankly, has been precisely to do that, to embed in humans the sort of algorithmic capacity
2270000	2279120	to run the complicated bureaucracies that allow governance to occur. And the easiest, best example
2279120	2287200	of that, it was the notion of the calculator, which as you know, was originally a human job,
2287840	2291920	particular people. So it was the word computer. The word computer was also originally applied
2291920	2297360	to human beings. Human beings, there we go. So individual human beings were trained to be
2297680	2307520	unreasonably or more than usual good at rapid and high fidelity
2308880	2315040	calculation. And we used them to do that. And that enabled a whole big increase in bureaucratic
2315040	2321200	capacity. But it has the enormous dehumanizing characteristic of vastly up regulating certain
2321200	2327600	capacities out of out of all proportion to a whole human. And of course, completely ignoring
2327600	2332560	all the rest of them. And so if your job was to be a calculator, you go to work and you would sort
2332560	2338960	of flex a particular muscle to a high to hypertrophy. And the institution that you were
2338960	2342800	part of really didn't care at all about the rest of you. In fact, to the best of its ability,
2342800	2348240	tried not to. The Kafka ass nightmare. Yes. Yeah, to the point. And so I would say this is actually
2348800	2354320	a consequence, first and foremost, of complicatedness. But in particular,
2355360	2360160	one of the results of the institutional structures of the era of literacy. Now,
2360160	2366560	what happened, of course, is that the calculator properly or the technical calculator emerged,
2366560	2374240	which liberated humans from that particular role. And I mean that both earnestly, meaning it freed
2374240	2380560	people from the odium of being poor machines. But I also mean, ironically, meaning it caused them
2380560	2386480	to no longer have that job. And we'll get to that point in a moment. But the the era that we're
2386480	2394480	entering into, particularly AI era, but also the robotics here and others, portends a tremendously
2394480	2400400	larger liberation of humans from the odium of being mediocre machines. And I mean, this being
2400480	2406000	accountants and being lawyers, and frankly, in many cases, mean doctors, including and up to all
2406000	2411520	the other kinds of things that people do. And this begs an interesting question, which is, one,
2413440	2418000	how do we avoid the the inverse of that, which to say, how do we avoid the catastrophe of everybody
2418000	2425600	being unemployed? And then two, at the limit, what does that mean? Like what role do human beings play
2425600	2432080	in a world where so many things that human beings used to do are now being held vastly
2432080	2438800	more effectively by machines? And so the role of technology, those are some of the most fundamental
2438800	2444720	questions. And any new form of governance needs to address, particularly those two questions.
2445680	2449120	Well, we'll just say three, the three primary questions, which is,
2449680	2455200	how do we navigate the problem that our existing institutional structure
2457040	2462720	is premised around people only being able to meet their physical material needs by virtue of doing
2462720	2468560	certain kinds of work that are going to become obsolete relatively soon and relatively too
2468560	2475280	rapidly to try to do this retraining thing effectively. So that's one, I call I've called
2475360	2482720	up the coming great economic transition. Two, how do we do so in a fashion which ennobles the human
2482720	2490240	spirit? You know, something like a, we're all on the on the dole of the UBI, let's call it the UBI
2490240	2496480	nightmare, or the negative form of that, where everybody is sort of wandering around in the
2496480	2503680	soul destroying swamp that destroys people when they win the lottery is a is a is a fail fail
2503680	2507360	condition in a catastrophic way. And so we have to figure out that as well. Like, how do we
2507360	2513680	simultaneously migrate people to where they are properly liberated from the odium of being poor
2513680	2518720	machines, but actually liberated into a proper human role in the world? And what does that look
2518720	2523120	like? What is that? I would say, by the way, that it's making effective choices, that that's our
2523120	2528640	most fundamental thing. And that to become virtuous is directly related to that, but we'll get to
2528640	2536320	that in a moment. Okay, so let me let me then I've got two more bullet points that I think are
2536320	2539440	useful to put into the question about those first two, because I think there's a
2542320	2546080	I mean, of course, so there's been there's been analogues to this, they're not the same. So that's
2546080	2552880	why I'm using the word analog, right? So you get the displacement of the farmer in ancient,
2553760	2559440	in the Roman Republic, and in the Empire by the slave. And then you get the drift into the city
2559440	2566080	and you get the permanently unemployed living on the dole of the government, right? And then what
2566080	2571840	you have is you have the problem of the mob, which is I think is very analogous to what you're
2571840	2579840	proposing. And then the solution, of course, was the bread and circuses solution and then the pageantry
2579920	2587040	of the God King in order to distract people. And my concern is that it's not just a problem of
2587040	2591840	prescience you're pointing to, but there's also a problem of competition that all of these other
2591840	2600160	factors of entertainment, bread and circuses and God Kings is also already being adopted
2600160	2609120	as a prevalent and pervasive strategy for dealing with what you're pointing to. So it's not just
2609200	2615040	that there's something coming of which we are not prepared. It seems to me it's already occurring
2615040	2621600	and noxious elements that will thwart any real solution already have significant power and influence.
2621600	2627600	So I'm just trying to amplify what you're saying. Yeah, I don't, the way that you speak does not
2627600	2633680	allow the kind of aesthetics of firebrand to be voiced upon you, but that was a very firebrandy
2633680	2639680	thing you just said, which with which I agree profoundly. So I'll put it in a slightly different
2639680	2644560	way, I think. And by the way, if I'm putting it in a way that is not harmonious with what you just
2644560	2652640	said, you can obviously put the blame for that on me. The poor experts, I'm going to make a
2652640	2659200	distinction between expertise and competence, the poor experts who have been given, and in some
2659200	2666000	sense taken, authority and responsibility for governance, the technocracy. When faced with
2666560	2670400	the contemporary version of the Roman problematic that you just described,
2672240	2677840	seemed to have no other recourse than to implement a contemporary version of the same tools
2678400	2686160	the Romans implemented. So perhaps instead of lions and gladiators, we're currently using
2686880	2692960	Netflix and are exploring how we might use VR in the metaverse, but it's the same thing.
2694000	2702320	And so, and the point I would make when I say the poor experts is that they never had a chance
2704160	2710560	that the notion of expertise is one of the things that is, I would say, part of the notion of
2710560	2718240	complicatedness and isn't the right kind of thing. Yeah, expertise is a domain specific term,
2718240	2723840	not a domain general term. And interestingly enough is the kind of thing that machines
2723840	2730000	will be very much better at. Yes, already in many ways. Many ways and increasingly. And this other
2730000	2737920	category or other thing that I'll simply call competence is what will replace it. And by the
2737920	2746560	way, yes, and I also define competence as awareness, sensitivity to the whole context
2747280	2752960	that is under investigation. So as an example of what this new governance model looks like,
2754080	2762560	it is composed of holes that are deeply contextually governed. And so instead of
2762640	2770880	WHLE, by the way, WHLE, yes, rather than a disciplinary structure that endeavors to
2770880	2778560	analytically break worlds into discrete domains, which then one can produce expertise in,
2779440	2784560	and then endeavor to govern in a complicated fashion using some form of bureaucratic institution.
2785840	2789440	And the new form of governance, which by the way is the same as the old form of governance,
2789440	2795680	but now hopefully more robust. We actually are aware of the fact that context matters,
2795680	2800720	that all parts are parts of holes and deeply subtle and oftentimes very difficult to notice
2800720	2808640	fashions. And that the new competence involves a capacity to be in relationship with the sort
2808640	2813920	of the intrinsics of a well integrated whole, let's say for example, a river system,
2814800	2821120	which fully implicates all of the other things, both in terms of nested holes, like the river
2821120	2827680	system is part of both a water system and a air system, for example, and a biological system,
2827680	2834160	the presence of beavers significantly changes the notion of how rivers work. And the new,
2834160	2841840	the competence I am defining as a new sort of literacy or a new capacity in governance is both
2841840	2847760	awareness, what I just, the fact that I just pointed out, I that it is a whole and also
2847760	2852880	the fact that all holes implicate a variety of other kinds of holes in highly subtle
2853840	2861520	context sensitive ways, which is radically different from the kind of thing a that expertise
2861520	2866960	could ever do, and therefore be that even extremely sophisticated AI systems could ever do.
2867680	2876640	I fundamentally agree. In fact, it's always amazing to me how much our projects
2877360	2886400	resonantly converge. I mean, the whole project, one of the main thrusts of the
2886400	2892880	platonic dialogues with Socrates is to get people to make this move, to move them off
2892960	2898640	authority or intuition to expertise, and then say, but nevertheless, expertise is not wisdom,
2898640	2902800	and you do this sort of double move, and you're trying to get people be like you got trying to
2902800	2909360	get them post expertise in the understanding of what wisdom is. And then of course, you have in
2909360	2919840	that the platonic tonus, the stereoscopic commitment to we are always finite, we're always in the
2919840	2926080	finitary predicament, but we are always oriented towards transcendence, we are all we are oriented
2926080	2931280	towards the whole, right, the synoptic integration. And if we lose either one of these, we fall into
2931280	2936800	tyranny or servitude, and we have to hold the two together, and that that is a domain general thing,
2936800	2941600	and it's not an extra, it's not something for which there can be an expertise. And ultimately,
2941600	2945920	we can only properly love it, we can never possess it. Because if we think we possess it,
2945920	2951360	then we've converted it back into expertise, etc, etc. All of this is so I mean, and that's
2951360	2957280	of course what I'm trying to tease out, and turn into practice with the After Socrates project is
2958480	2965760	exactly that what you're calling competence that that but to me, that is the ancient platonic
2965760	2971200	call to the love of wisdom. Well, let's let's double click on that. So what I'd like to do is
2971200	2979760	I'd also now like to officially, they claim to the meaning of the term sovereignty. I feel that it
2979760	2989360	has been I'm a squatter, it's been it's been left under occupied. And by force measure, I'm claiming
2989360	2996400	it. Okay, let me define what I mean by it, please. So I'm going to kind of walk around a little bit
2996400	3003360	because I feel like I want to poke a few things. One of the things I've noticed about the American
3004160	3014160	constitutional frame, that I believe is a fundamental flaw, is that it largely defines itself
3014960	3022080	by virtue of a negative space in relationship to the monarchy with which it was struggling.
3023040	3031440	So the nation of liberty represents the degree to which an aristocracy has
3032560	3043040	right to limit the power of monarchy. This conception of liberty therefore intrinsically
3043040	3050240	implies a tyranny that is resistance against. Yeah, it's a freedom from the Berlin talks about
3050320	3057120	exactly. And unfortunately, therefore, as your various institutions that are endeavoring to
3058000	3066240	propose or hold liberty degrade as institutions are want to do, interestingly enough, the tyranny
3066240	3072640	that was held at the shadow, but nonetheless held in the story will raise its ugly face.
3073120	3081600	That's one way of this. I'm putting that out there because the notion of sovereignty that we have
3081600	3088080	received is equivalent, meaning it is largely described as a negative freedom. And I would say
3088080	3096000	that both the concept of the sovereign state and in a meaningful sense, the sovereign individual,
3096000	3102960	I mean by that in a moment, are in fact nonsense. The state cannot be sovereign per se. And that
3102960	3108080	is because the conception of sovereignty that is endeavor to be used is not coherent.
3110880	3117280	And that the sovereign individual, which is understood as the next step of the breaking
3117280	3122400	down of the kind of sovereignty that is described when we talk about the state as sovereign. So
3122400	3127280	we say we take the concept of sovereignty that we're using when we think of the sovereign state
3127280	3131040	and we simply replace the word state with the word individual. So we see a sovereign
3131040	3138560	in that sense. This is also incoherent. Okay. So what do I think is a coherent meaning for the
3138560	3144800	concept of sovereignty? What I mean is this, do you mean incoherent because it's largely negative
3145680	3150080	negatively defined and it doesn't have any internal coherency holding it together? Is that what
3150080	3157360	you mean? Okay, good. It exists only by virtue of describing something that it is in resistance
3157360	3162400	against. Like the way in the Cold War, freedom became freedom from communism. And then when
3162400	3167680	communism sort of ends, the notion of freedom becomes sort of unmoored and people realize
3167680	3171440	that it's incoherent. It has many different equivocal meanings floating around. Something
3171440	3178240	like that just by analogy. Very nice analogy. Okay. So from the inverse, from the center out,
3178960	3183040	and this is something I talked about at least an amount like five years ago, but I haven't
3183040	3190080	brought it up recently. The notion of sovereignty means the capacity to make effective choices
3190080	3195360	in a given context. We can explicate what I mean by effective choice, but for the moment,
3195360	3201840	I'll just leave that. But the point there is twofold. And by the way, the notion of sovereignty
3201840	3209200	therefore resonates very strongly with the broader notion of virtue, which is to say that a
3210160	3216640	being that has sovereignty is a being that also has a deep embodiment of a diverse number of
3216640	3223360	virtues in particular in relationship to a given context. And so one cannot be sovereign in essence
3223360	3229680	unless you're speaking about perhaps the notion of God as you discussed with Bishop Maximus,
3229680	3235520	which I will not get into this moment. But finite beings are sovereign in the context of an actual
3235520	3240720	context. And that could be as trivial as sovereign in the context of making wood burn into a fire,
3241360	3248000	or as fundamental as sovereign in the context of say parenting, or in the context of
3248000	3253600	stewarding a community in relationship with multi generations and the nature that they live in and
3253600	3260480	on. But the point is very simple, and it connects very nicely with the notion of competence, meaning
3261120	3267360	I have a set of capacities, which include appropriate perception and sensitivities,
3268240	3275840	heuristics and tools, which can operate at the appropriate rate to perceive the relevant aspects,
3275840	3281360	I'm talking about robust relevance realization and actuation, to perceive the relevant aspects of
3281360	3290240	the context that I find myself in. And then I have the capacities to select appropriate choices
3290880	3296320	that, and then to actuate them elegantly, meaning using the constraints of energy and
3298400	3300880	the actual constraints of the environment that I'm in.
3301440	3305040	High cost opportunity costs, all that kind of stuff. Yes, all that kind of stuff.
3306000	3313840	To further my capacity to make choices in the next moment that I find myself in.
3313840	3320560	So the metaphor that I often use is surfing, meaning if I am sovereign in the context of
3320560	3326480	surfing, what that means is that I have a surfboard and I know how to surf. And in this particular
3326480	3332400	wave, I have the physical acumen to be able to paddle into it and drop into it. And then moment
3332480	3336800	to moment, I can make the micro movements of my body in relationship with the unfolding
3336800	3342240	reality of the complexity of the wave, which of course is itself a deeply complex relationship
3342240	3347280	with the energy of the wave, the winds and the subsurface and subsurface topography of the ocean.
3347920	3354640	So as to continue to find myself in that unique location of wave, such that my board is still
3354640	3359680	locked into the pocket and I continue to surf. And I can expand that out. So when I say
3360640	3362800	but yeah, I want to stop there because I want to probe on this because
3364160	3368720	I want to make sure well, I'll propose something of what I think I might be hearing.
3369840	3375200	So it sounds to me like sovereignty, the sovereign, I'll just I'm going to use the word
3375200	3379360	individual in a very generic sense, the sovereign individual because I don't necessarily mean a
3379360	3387680	human person. The sovereign individual is a species of a cognitive agent. So everything behaves
3387680	3393440	but agents are different from behaviors and that agents can determine the consequences of
3393440	3398960	their behavior and alter the behavior in order to bring about desired consequences. And they
3398960	3404240	have desired consequences because they are autonomous, auto poetic entities, they're a
3404240	3410720	self making entity. And so a paramecium is properly, very properly an agent. Now, I'm
3410720	3415440	wondering if you would extend the notion of sovereignty to a paramecium. And if not, just
3415440	3419840	let me finish. If not, then when I'm when I'm hearing when you invoke things like virtue,
3419840	3424880	because I don't know if we could talk about the virtue of paramecium, I think we're moving into
3424880	3430320	the idea of an Aristotelian idea. And that's not that's meant to be a compliment, right,
3430320	3439760	that a sovereign is an agent that has has reflectively appropriated its agency in order to
3439760	3446160	further enhance its agency, by to some degree, explicating and reflecting upon the machinery
3446160	3453680	of its agency, and recursively intervening in its agency in order to enhance its agentic
3453680	3459520	capacity, not just to achieve this goal or that goal, but to enhance its overall capacity to
3459520	3464960	achieve goals per se. Does that work as a proposal? Yes, this works very nice. Now,
3465440	3471200	in my own sort of kluge vocabulary, I meet the distinction between lowercase s and capital s.
3472400	3479360	And so I would say that a paramecium is lowercase s sovereign, that the the human journey and its
3479360	3488640	relationship with the theological journey is the capital s. And here I'm very much inspired by the
3488640	3493360	conversations that you have with Jonathan Paggio in relationship with things like symbolism. Yes,
3494320	3501600	that it's a vector, right, when we cannot ever achieve in this world, capital s sovereignty as
3501600	3508160	a finished state, as you've said, but rather it is a relationship with life and relationship with
3508160	3516080	self that has a directionality to it, a very, very, very precise directionality. But it is
3516080	3521200	unfolding in continuity. And that's part of the nature of the journey that we're all as humans.
3523360	3529440	So we find ourselves in a very interesting point. I would say that there's a lowercase sovereignty
3529440	3534240	that goes down to the limits of agency, right? So I'm not going to be opining around the kind of
3534240	3539200	a the place where Stuart Kaufman spent so much time, you know, it's a autocatalytic chemistry
3539200	3545360	sovereign, maybe, but there's a limit where paramecium, and most specifically in my example,
3545360	3552800	something like say heart cell is lowercase s. And what we find is that in particular,
3552800	3561680	these lower level holes or elements achieve a level of sovereignty in relationship with
3561680	3567120	other elements around things that are properly well integrated holes. What I mean is, for example,
3567120	3575040	an organ like a heart or a liver is a gathering together of lower scale lowercase s sovereigns
3575680	3584080	in a fashion that delivers a higher scale lowercase s sovereignty over a more complex domain.
3584080	3588960	Yeah, this is John, John Stuart's idea about although there's no teleology in evolution,
3588960	3594000	there's a gradient shift towards what he calls increasing entification, in which you get previously
3594000	3600240	autonomous things form a hole that is able is not that gives results that are not just the sum
3600240	3604560	of the parts and therefore you get this evolutionary advantage. And you get you get these building
3604560	3609200	up and he's proposing that we need, I don't know if you've seen any of the conversations I've had
3609200	3614480	with him, but he's proposing that we need to really ramp up the entification of distributed
3614480	3625360	cognition into something that we can really clearly see as having a designated role in
3625360	3631440	governance to use your language. Yes, yes, in fact, I recently did a conversation with a young man in
3632320	3639600	I think he's German, very young man, but he has ruled out a proposal that I would say is precisely
3639600	3643680	this kind of thing like an entification of distributed cognition with a lot of very nice
3643680	3648880	thoughts. So a lot of the embodiment, a lot of the actual he calls it incarnation, which I quite like
3649440	3654240	of this new form of governance, I think is largely about that. So let me give you a concrete
3654240	3659200	example in a different view of something that you and I have been doing a lot of and this notion
3659200	3667280	of the logos. So we have two distinct elements to it. And I actually, I'll add a third, which is
3667280	3674560	always going to be there. One is we have the notion of something like lowercase sovereignty
3674560	3682400	between communicating agents in relationship with the capacity to engage in creating a
3682400	3688000	communications channel. All right. And let me just kind of step back a bit. So the problem we're
3688000	3693440	dealing with is that the problem of distributed cognition, the problem of communication between
3693440	3699840	two humans, I'll just make it simple at that point. In the past, say for the past 250 years,
3699840	3705760	has been governed by something like paradigmatic structures, where we have things like well
3705760	3712240	defined terms, and we have things like shared disciplinary knowledge. And what happens is
3712320	3717680	that we sort of have a dictionary of well defined terms. You can feel like the resonance of
3717680	3723280	complicatedness here. And the game is actually pretty simple. Either I understand the term,
3723280	3728880	or I have to learn the term. So I join a discipline, I become a doctor, and I learn what, you know,
3728880	3733600	some esoteric medical term happens to mean, once I have achieved a level of expertise in
3733600	3737920	that particular language, I can then communicate with other members of that community. Now,
3737920	3743120	that's how we have solved this problem in paradigmatic space. And the problem of digital
3743120	3749440	is that we now have something like 8 billion distinct humans all operating in a vast space
3749440	3756240	of developing novel relationships with novel increasingly novel realities. And all paradigmatic
3756240	3762960	dictionaries now kind of fail, meaning the interaction I have with somebody on Twitter,
3762960	3767760	the ability for us to diagnose whether or not we're actually part of a preexisting
3768240	3772160	institutional structure and are actually using the same code book to define certain terms.
3773200	3777040	Things are happening too rapidly. And by the way, the meaning of terms is changing too rapidly
3777040	3780640	for that paradigmatic model to work. So we need a new code.
3780640	3782080	I'm guilty of this mistake as well.
3787680	3788000	Yeah.
3788000	3792320	But we actually need a new fundamental protocol, which assumes that we don't know what we're
3792320	3796320	talking about that assumes more or less that we actually don't have a shared vocabulary.
3796320	3799680	That's so Socratic through and through. It really is.
3799680	3805280	Yeah, it is. Okay. So think about the Socratic, the implication, right? There's really
3805840	3812480	three elements. One element is we need to have something like a protocol. Like how do we actually
3812480	3817040	do this? And by the way, I'm using the word protocol both because it's something that Indigenous
3817040	3822080	communities have used for a long time in terms of how to distinct groups who don't know each other,
3822080	3825200	go through the process of actually coming into relationship with each other, which is exactly
3825280	3829840	we're talking about. It's the upper Paleolithic. It's the original upper Paleolithic problem, right?
3831520	3836800	And of course, symbolism and shamanism were plausibly part of the solution to that original
3836800	3840400	version of the problem. I just want to throw that into the mix. Keep going.
3840400	3845120	I have a very, very poor historical theory that I operate with and exactly how that works,
3845120	3848640	but I won't throw that out there now because it's super non-rigorous. But you know, I like it.
3850880	3854160	But in any event, we need a protocol. And the other side of protocol that in the technical
3854160	3859360	world we use, of course, is technical protocol, like the internet protocol, like IP. And if we
3859360	3863200	think about that, I don't know if you're old enough to remember, remember the old dial-up modem
3863200	3868160	and the way that it worked? If you think about it, every single sound that it made actually was a
3868160	3873280	physical instantiation of a certain stage of the protocol that actually builds up the process of
3873280	3878000	moving from, are we able to communicate at all? Are we both the kinds of things that have the
3878000	3882240	potential to communicate? Up through a series of things that they call handshakes of saying,
3882240	3886800	okay, well, great. You're the kind of thing that communicates. Neat. Let me make a proposal of how
3886800	3891040	we might communicate. Oh, you agree. Cool. Now, we're going to use that to bootstrap the next
3891040	3898560	level to the next level until eventually, you know, I can transmit AOL over a 56K connection
3898560	3902960	on top of twisted copper telephone wires, which is a pretty profound thing. We're talking about
3902960	3908560	the same kind of thing, right? Every time two individual humans connect via social media,
3908560	3915120	we're actually implicitly engaging in that kind of action poorly. Yes. So the new form of governance
3915120	3919280	is going to have to actually do that properly. We'll have a process whereby we can actually
3919280	3926640	identify where are we in some kind of well-defined stack of relationality and then have a process,
3926640	3931360	a protocol, for establishing a communications channel through which we can then engage in
3932080	3937680	building a context of relationality. Okay. So let me make sure I'm hearing you right. So one of the
3937680	3945280	central tasks of the new government, new governance, not new government, that was a slip, new governance
3945280	3954240	is to replace poor product protocol with proper protocol. Yes. Okay. Yes. And in a second, I'm
3954240	3958640	going to bring back one of the primary components of proper protocol. But for right now, I'm going to
3958640	3967280	say the second kind of capacity is competence in implementing that protocol. So to be sovereign
3967360	3974640	in relationship with communication. And you've actually put tremendous amount of effort into
3974640	3979200	that sort of thing in the context of things like what does a human being have to have as sort of
3979200	3984480	basic human capabilities to engage in dialogues? Right. Yeah. A simple example is one that I've
3985200	3991600	taken from my friend, Benita Roy, she taught me, was the notion of mapping error or the one that
3991600	3996640	you call that often, which has to do with disambiguation or noticing what there is.
3997760	4000720	Now, what's the word that you used to describe it? When a meaning is not clear.
4001360	4002480	Like equivocal?
4002480	4010720	equivocal. Exactly. You know, a new literacy is to have a psychological awareness of the fact
4010720	4016160	that terms can be equivocal. And that quite often, if you are communicating with somebody,
4016160	4020880	and their use of a term doesn't make any sense to you, you are likely dealing with an equivocation,
4020880	4025360	or perhaps even distinct linguistic histories, where they're using that word to mean something
4025360	4029760	completely differently, because it is embodied in a very different lineage context. And having,
4029760	4034480	for example, an emotional response of curiosity, and the ability to activate a disambiguation
4034480	4039760	protocol, as opposed to an emotional response of wanting to punch them in the face or cancel them,
4039760	4044080	for example. Right. You know, in the current environment, because we're operating using
4044720	4051680	very broken indigenous, you know, human tribal familial capacities to engage in this
4051680	4056960	random walkthrough innovation space, we find ourselves in the unspeakably novel context
4056960	4062640	of endeavoring to communicate with human beings that we've never met, are currently interacting
4062640	4068960	with in embodied fashion, via principally just small amounts of text, and therefore oftentimes
4068960	4072240	make mistakes, like we get really angry when they say something that doesn't sound right to us.
4073200	4078800	Okay. And you get the reverse error that people try to communicate the wrong kind of thing
4079360	4084240	in a medium. They try to communicate a philosophical argument on Twitter, which is a disaster.
4084240	4089840	Which is a disaster, exactly. And by the way, it goes all the way down. Like my wife and I
4090800	4097760	being very nerdy, have many times had the conversation of, to me, darling, that particular
4097760	4101840	question that you're asking is not appropriately asked while you're driving in the car using text.
4102480	4108400	Yeah. Yeah. We should wait, like, you know, until we have an interpersonal face to face to
4108400	4112560	have that conversation, because that's the appropriate communications context to have
4112560	4116560	that particular kind of relationality. So let me loop back to the notion of what a proper protocol
4116560	4123280	ultimately unfolds into. A proper protocol creates the appropriate communications context
4123920	4129680	to then begin the embodiment of the proper relational context that has the right sort
4129680	4137520	of richness and sensitivity and nuance to instantiate a wholeness that we can build
4137520	4144000	then a relational competence that can hold whatever it is we're actually going to be dealing with.
4144000	4150320	I see what you mean now. I mean, the workshops where we take people through meditation,
4150320	4156720	contemplation, the circling practices into the philosophical fellowship. And then we do all
4156800	4163840	of that to build up that protocol. Right. And then we, the people are introduced to dialectic
4163840	4172160	into deologos. Exactly. And let me tell you, my study of this tells me that just getting that part
4172160	4181120	right will resolve 80% of the problems we're currently dealing with. It is profound what
4181120	4186240	happens if we just get the combination of a proper protocol, which has this very specific
4186240	4190720	element of understanding that communication context that develops proper relationality
4191600	4197040	and humans who are sovereign in the context of those two pieces. If we get that element together,
4197680	4202000	multiplied by the fact that we actually do have 8 billion agentic minds that are just sort of
4203040	4207040	radically being underutilized, lots of good stuff happens and lots of bad stuff goes away.
4208320	4213920	Okay. So that's one example of what this new Neo-Neocortex looks like. Let me give you a
4213920	4217040	different example. And then I think we may have actually been kind of running out of time, which is
4218000	4221040	nice. It feels like we've done some really good stuff. Well, I think we've laid the
4221040	4226800	foundations for the series very well. Yeah. So I mean, lay this other one down,
4227680	4231920	because I feel like it's potent. And I noticed that it confused, actually, Schmacktenberger,
4231920	4237600	when I talked with him about it about a year and a half ago, it didn't land then. And I'm not sure
4237600	4245600	if it ever really did. So if we think about an old fashioned notion of government, and we'll all
4245600	4253200	just use the American way of doing it, we ended up dividing it into three distinct domains, the
4253200	4262160	executive, the legislative, and the juridical. Here's my proposition. My proposition is that the
4262160	4273680	move into the digital has, as a primary element, a radical releasing of energies, let's say,
4275360	4282480	that have been unduly bound into this location of being a false machine. In other words,
4283120	4291760	the civic code. We made a mistake of binding too much into algorithms and binding too much into
4292880	4297760	humans running bureaucracies and things like that. And then the move into the digital liberates that
4297760	4301440	tremendously. We talked about that a moment ago in terms of liberating human energy that we no
4301440	4306320	longer have to be calculators. But I mean the same thing in the context of these higher order
4306320	4311200	abstractions of governance. And specifically what I mean is, the notion of the function of the
4311200	4318480	legislative, of which, by the way, the regulatory is a subsidiary, is radically displaced in the new
4318480	4327120	form of governance, that the era of literacy was the crowning of the legislative, and that's no
4327120	4336400	longer either needed or necessary or proper. That the era of the digital involves a radically
4336400	4345040	reduction, a radical reduction of the legislative function, and a restoration of the juridical
4345040	4350880	function. Which, by the way, completely changes the location of the executive function, but I
4350880	4356080	don't think we have time to get there. And what I discovered when I was thinking about this is a
4356080	4361920	really beautiful notion of revival. And I think you may have actually been the one who put it in my
4361920	4368480	head, or maybe Bishop Maximus, because I'm thinking about Exodus, and I'm thinking about Moses.
4369440	4374400	And I'm thinking about topology. So, in the story of Moses, who played a very interesting
4374400	4381120	role. Moses played the role of governance in the context of the Jews traveling across the
4381120	4390240	desert as the direct interface to God. But he played the role of judge, not the role of king.
4392800	4394640	There were many judges. There's a whole book of the Bible.
4395600	4403200	Yeah, that transition is the key. That tells me, to the story of the Torah,
4403200	4409280	let's say the Old Testament, that the notion of judge is more fundamental. It is the proper
4409280	4414720	location of where the heart of governance is. Meaning, it's how you steward the commons,
4414720	4419760	and think about how commons' law works. Oh, I see. This is very interesting.
4419760	4425200	Jeritical. Commons' law. Jeritical. What does that mean? What that means is
4426000	4435280	wisdom. We use wisdom to resolve disputes, as opposed to endeavoring to codify
4436720	4444080	choice, create constraints in bureaucracies to govern choice. We rather recognize that sovereign
4444080	4449920	human beings, and I mean this in both senses in the term now, are making choices locally at the
4449920	4454720	lowest level on the ground with the highest degree of a perception of what's really happening, and
4454720	4460480	the highest degree of the ability to ultimately express their values into world by themselves,
4460480	4466080	like in small self-organizing groups. And that the biggest challenge, the most fundamental
4466080	4471520	challenge of governance, beyond, by the way, communication, which we just covered, is resolving
4471520	4477440	conflict, where these groups of individuals and groups of individuals find themselves noticing
4477440	4483840	that their sovereignty is not adequate to the scope of the wholeness that they are in relationship with.
4484560	4490720	And therefore, we need to have individuals who are notably wise and are arranged in such a way.
4491280	4500560	When Moses was counseled to make subsidiarity a principle and grant
4500560	4504320	juridical authority to a constellation of judges besides himself,
4506160	4511200	it was done fractally at different levels of scale, all the way down to, I believe, 10,
4511200	4515440	which is really neat to think about that granularly. But the two rules were that the
4515440	4518960	individuals were wise and they were not corruptible, and they were not likely to be
4519200	4524560	off, meaning that their interests were aligned with both the individuals that they were interacting
4524560	4528720	with personally and with the larger whole, and they had a competence, they had a sovereignty
4528720	4534560	that was adequate to the responsibility that they were holding. Well, that's that. And so
4534560	4540480	this is there's two moves here. One move is the removal of the legislative as the center or the
4540480	4545120	more fundamental notion of governance, which is the same thing as the removal of the bureaucratic
4545120	4552720	or the algorithmic. And the second is the restoration of a subsidiarity or a fractal,
4553520	4561920	wisdom based commons law that is principally around developing highly context aware. Remember the
4561920	4568320	notion of the legislature has to do with the abstraction of trying to create general rules
4568320	4571680	that are as relevant to particular contexts as they can be.
4572400	4580880	Prespecify. Yes, I get it. Context aware. Whereas a fine grained common law is precisely
4581440	4588160	context aware. It is a conflict between two real situated humans in a real actual environment that
4588160	4593280	has real actual consequences for all the other people in the nature with which they're in relationship.
4593920	4601280	And a proper judge has proper responsibility for addressing the whole thing.
4602080	4607440	It may be that X is the right thing to do instead of Y. And that's the judge's job. And then we want
4607440	4615200	to do is we want to build the right kind of meta context such that the judges aren't corrupt,
4615200	4619680	that the judges are there, that they're wise. And by wise, I actually mean both that they actually
4619680	4624080	have real sovereignty in relationship to the context they have responsibility for, but also
4624080	4629040	that they're actually embedded, meaning that they're legitimate in the Habermasian sense.
4629120	4635360	Does that make sense? Yeah, so far it does. So I mean, two questions emerge. One is,
4636880	4642240	why did the Israel, I mean, I'm going to use the mythological language. I'm asking a general
4642240	4647280	question, but why did the Israelites want to replace the judges with kings? Because that seems
4647280	4653360	to be a question that needs to be answered. And I think there's a related question, which is,
4653920	4659120	how do we deal with the Promethean spirit, which regards tradition as something to be overcome
4659120	4668560	because we emphasize the progress into the new? And how do we keep that distinct from the openness
4668560	4676400	to emergence? That for me is a pressing problem right now, right? You want to be beholding to
4676400	4682480	the tradition, but you don't want to fall into being a traditionalist. You want to be somebody
4682480	4690720	who is open to emergence without pronouncing death on the, commit it to the flames of the tradition.
4691280	4696320	And then thirdly, you have Plato's problem. Who's going to guard the guardians? The philosopher
4696320	4701440	kings are very much Plato's attempt to get something like the judges. And of course,
4701440	4706320	it did happen. We had Marcus Aurelius. But the thing that's interesting there is it took,
4706320	4712720	it took non-constitutional constraints, a bunch of gay emperors that adopted their errors,
4713520	4718160	bunch of errors from which they then chose the most competent, really in your sense,
4718160	4722560	in order for it to work. And of course, Plato didn't have a solution to that problem,
4722560	4728960	and he kept wrestling with it. And many people, in fact, argue that the republic is,
4730320	4734000	and I agree with this, is a profound critique of any utopic proposals.
4734720	4737920	So that would be the three questions, and maybe those can be the questions we could
4739520	4746160	pursue next time. Yeah, can I just address a little bit of the first, just kind of put a hook,
4746160	4750000	and then I think it's exactly right for us to do the rest next time, because it feels to me like
4750000	4754080	that's a, what I'd like to do is invoke and open a proper space of deologous on that question.
4754080	4759200	Yes, yes, totally. It goes without saying that's a quite a potent question. All right,
4759200	4763120	so the first, I will put this out here, and I think it creates some pretty good hooks. And the
4763840	4768000	regional question, the first question was, why did the Israelites go from judges to kings?
4769920	4777760	Here's why, I think. I will say it with some assertiveness. The executive function,
4777760	4784960	which is fundamentally the king, and remember, for example, in medieval Europe, the king played
4784960	4790960	both the role of judge, like juridical functions grounded in the king, and the judges who traveled
4791040	4797680	around and implemented common law were direct reports to the king, and also played the military
4797680	4803360	function, here's the thing. The executive function, which is to say the enforcement of the law,
4804800	4812960	in a well constituted community, is an intrinsic of the juridical function. Let me make that
4812960	4819680	explicit. So let's say we have a group of 10 people, and they all know each other, like they're all
4819680	4825360	in real relationship, and they've all identified a given individual as wise, which is to say that
4825360	4830880	individual has high legitimacy. They all trust this person as wise and well-intentioned with regard
4830880	4837680	to both each individual and to the larger group as a whole. So a properly created community,
4838720	4843440	when a conflict emerges between members of that community, and eventually becomes something that
4843440	4850240	is subject to juridical evaluation, the wise elder will opine on it, will speak with wisdom and
4850240	4858320	clarity, and if done well, if they actually have done a proper job, that it's self-enforcing, meaning
4858880	4865600	that the one person, for example, or perhaps the two people in conflict, who may or may not be super
4865600	4871520	awesome, happy with the results of the judgment, have aid other people in the community, that
4871520	4876000	they're in very deep complex relationship with, who are all sort of looking at them and saying,
4876000	4880480	look, this is how we do it here. And wisdom has spoken, and honestly, it sounds pretty fucking
4880480	4884640	wise. So I don't know what problem you've got with it, but get in line. It's self-enforcing,
4884640	4889280	because the community actually has proper scale, meaning there's not too many people involved,
4889280	4896320	and it has proper verticality, that the wisdom is legitimate. Now, we have two problems that emerge.
4896320	4902720	One is when you're dealing with war, when you're actually dealing with problems where many of your
4902720	4908960	disputes don't have a shared sense of wisdom. When I have a dispute with a neighboring tribe,
4908960	4915120	let's say the Philistines, and I don't have any shared elder, we can resolve those disputes in
4915120	4922720	the fashion I just described, we resolve disputes using war, and war is king, not judge. And what
4922800	4927680	happened to the ancient Israelites is that the day they left the desert, and they entered the land
4927680	4934160	of milken honey, they immediately entered into war, and therefore left the realm of judge qua
4934160	4939280	judge, and entered the realm of king qua king. And we have been living in that world ever since,
4940240	4946640	both historically in some sense, and also within the mythological sense. And so one of the reasons
4946640	4951680	why our current governance system is so jacked is it's in fact designed to constantly be fighting war.
4952800	4959040	And therefore the elevation of the executive. The other side of it is when you are entered into
4959040	4967040	a place that has a muscular legislature, and no longer is grounded in a commons, then there aren't
4967040	4972640	any any truly integrated holes that have both horizontality and vertical, right? When I have
4972640	4980800	a judge in the American political system, evaluate the laws that are written by a legislature,
4981680	4987120	I have no particular sense that any of those guys are either a non corrupt or b wise or c
4987120	4994320	have my interest in mind at all, and is imposed upon me, as if it's at war. And so therefore,
4994320	5001360	I then again have to be and have a relationship of king. The only way to enforce the laws in a
5001360	5006720	society where everyone is fundamentally separated from proper real relationality,
5007280	5016720	is the implementation of the king style, the executive at the top. And when we have moved
5016720	5022640	into this new form of governance, this neo neo cortex, remember I mentioned planetary scale
5022640	5028480	is one of the problematics that we're dealing with. All humans will be in fact in a relationship of
5029360	5034480	context, relationship of a fully integrated proper whole with verticality and horizontality,
5034560	5040880	which means that we are no longer in a position of intrinsically at war, but rather in a space
5040880	5048080	where the juridical can and therefore, and should play the proper role as the base of
5048080	5055600	governance, which is very nice. It also applies to the default state of everybody being in a
5055600	5060800	relationship of sort of default war, meaning social relationships, relationships that are
5060800	5068880	not real, not rich, will also no longer be the case. And so conflict can in fact be mitigated by
5068880	5077280	a properly constructed juridical constellation. So I'll put that as a provisional answer to the
5077280	5082400	first question and propose that it also creates a tremendous amount of hooks into the nature of
5082400	5086160	how we might respond to the second question. Well, I'm going to give you an initial thing
5086160	5092400	about the second question then, since you did an initial for the first, which is Moses isn't
5092400	5098160	just a judge, he's also a prophet and all of the judges were also prophets. In fact, the terms are
5098160	5104800	used and then after the institution of the king, the prophet becomes distinct. And then of course,
5104800	5109760	the idea is Christ brings back the pre re integrates the priest, the king and the prophet.
5109760	5115520	But here's the thing about the emergence issue, right? I think we shouldn't judge people,
5115520	5122000	sorry, we shouldn't people should not ascend to the role or if that's even the right verb,
5122000	5128720	but whatever, ascend to the role of judge just because of their retrospective capacity to deal
5128720	5136080	with appropriating and applying the tradition, they should also have a prophetic capacity
5136880	5143120	to disclose what is pertinent and perennial in a way that shakes people up to what is emerging.
5143600	5153360	Oh, man, that is so sweet. Yes. That is beautiful. Good Lord. I feel like a limited manuscript in
5153360	5164240	words. So thank you. Yeah. So let's play with those two ideas when we come back and pick this up.
5164720	5173440	And as always, I'm going to give my guest, which is you, the opportunity for last word.
5173440	5177440	Doesn't that be summative or cumulative? It could just be inspirational, aspirational or
5177440	5181840	provocative. It could be enigmatic, but how what parting word do you want to leave?
5183760	5191040	Let's call it an invocation. We entered into this stage of our relationship, our dialogue,
5191680	5195360	with a sense of timeliness, meaning that it appears that we are now at a time where it's
5195360	5201440	proper, necessary and possible for this new form of governance to finally begin the process of
5201440	5207360	happening. And so the invocation is that perhaps this conversation will begin that in earnest,
5207360	5211200	and that perhaps we're kicking off something deeply new in the human story.
5211200	5218400	I hope so too. Thank you so much, my dear friend. Wow.
