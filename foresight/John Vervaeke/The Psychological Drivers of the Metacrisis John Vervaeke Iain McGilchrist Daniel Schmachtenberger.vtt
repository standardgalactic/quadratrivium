00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
Welcome everyone. This past September, September 2023, I had the great pleasure of sitting down in Oxford with Ian McGilchrist and Daniel Schmacktenberger, and we recorded this video.

00:12.000 --> 00:35.000
It's an intense and deep and exciting discussion in which we use our collective attention and whatever collective wisdom we were able to muster to try and address the question of the metacrisis that's facing us.

00:35.000 --> 00:48.000
This video has shown up on Daniel's channel and on Ian's channel, but I thought my audience should also have direct and specific access to it.

00:48.000 --> 01:02.000
It's a long video, but we're getting tremendous amount of positive feedback on how it's worth the time put into it. So I'm going to thank you ahead of time for your time and attention.

01:02.000 --> 01:15.000
So we are here today to discuss, I believe the title of this will be called something like the Psychological Drivers of the Metacrisis and what possible responses might look like.

01:15.000 --> 01:34.000
And so I'll start briefly with what do we mean by metacrisis and then ask you to share some of the short version of the models that you have shared at great depth in your writing and your work, and ask you to also share

01:34.000 --> 01:45.000
your opening frame so that people who aren't already familiar with your work can come along, though everybody should, if they're interested in this, go deeper. There's a lot of resources to go deeper.

01:45.000 --> 02:00.000
I'm also not assuming, since we all just know each other a tiny bit, enough to have a sense of shared interest, but not enough that we've already done this. This is extemporaneous, which is part of what makes it very interesting to me.

02:00.000 --> 02:20.000
So I'm not assuming that either of you share the exact same assessment of the metacrisis. That's not implicit in you being here, but I know from our conversations you both share a sense that the state of the world has problems and impending risks that are serious,

02:20.000 --> 02:35.000
that are not automatically resolving themselves, that are novel in history. So we can just say the challenging state of the world, what in the nature of human mind, the nature of human conditioning experience,

02:35.000 --> 02:56.000
we might even find that the term psychology or cognitive drivers are insufficient, which is fine, has brought us here, and what might a different relationship to human mind, psychology, cognition look like that might allow a more viable, better future.

02:56.000 --> 03:10.000
So just briefly on the metacrisis frame, before World War Two there was no risk that we could very quickly destroy the entire habitability of human civilization.

03:10.000 --> 03:26.000
That was brought into being with very powerful technology, nuclear weapons, and for the first time ever we had the ability to make a series of bad decisions and radically change the possibility space of the world.

03:27.000 --> 03:45.000
Before the Industrial Revolution we didn't really have the capability of destroying the biosphere at scale, that's not as fast, that takes a few hundred years, but we're at the place where the planetary boundaries in terms of species extinction, in terms of chemical pollution, in terms of many planetary boundaries are being crossed.

03:45.000 --> 04:03.000
The Stockholm Resilience Center published its update to the planetary boundaries framework just a few days ago that showed of the nine major boundaries they've identified we've radically crossed six already, which means who knows if we were to change the direction already what would happen.

04:03.000 --> 04:20.000
And that was the result of the Industrial Revolution and the technology that it made possible, moving us from half a billion people before the Industrial Revolution to eight billion people, and increasing the resource consumption per capita by about a hundred X in the industrialized world.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
So sixteen times the population, a hundred times the resource consumption per population, obviously without advanced tech we couldn't do that.

04:28.000 --> 04:52.000
So there's something about the crises that we're facing and then obviously AI and synthetic biology and drones and cyber weapons and the radically complicated six continent supply chain that is all very novel human technological development that wasn't true in any previous age.

04:53.000 --> 05:05.000
Without human technology there is no global existential risk that is human induced. There might be a meteor or something, but not anthropogenic catastrophic risk. So we're in a unique position in time.

05:05.000 --> 05:17.000
The poly crisis is a frame that a lot of people have heard that says rather than just focus on climate change or just coral or just species extinction or just nuclear we have to focus on all these issues.

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
And we have to recognize that they can inter-effect each other, that one of these issues getting worse can cascade into other ones and that sometimes the solution to one can make other ones worse.

05:26.000 --> 05:43.000
So the answer in World War Two to how do we not have nuclear war was mutually assured destruction and the Bretton Woods Global Financial System and a whole bunch of like the whole post-war order, which did mean we didn't have nuclear war between superpowers.

05:43.000 --> 05:53.000
But it was also part of what led to the six continent supply chain and exponential growth connected to a linear materials economy that have pushed us to the planetary boundaries.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
And so we can see solutions to some problems can end up leading to other ones.

05:57.000 --> 06:11.000
The metacrisis frame, the slight distinction from that terminology from the poly crisis is that we're not just looking at the mini crises and how they can cascade, but that there are underlying dynamics that give rise to them.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Obviously humans are animals, we're part of nature.

06:16.000 --> 06:32.000
We're also pretty obviously unique when you fly into London or into New York or whatever and you look at the world you see the Anthropocene in a way that the next most environment modifying creatures are things like beavers.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
This is obviously a radically different scale of environment modification.

06:37.000 --> 06:48.000
And so there's something about human technology that arises from something about human mind, both our capacity to create it and then also how we utilize it.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
So some people look at the origin of the metacrisis starting with stone tools.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
Some look at it starting with the agricultural revolution and the plow or the industrial revolution or various places that I think they're all interesting.

07:00.000 --> 07:17.000
But if we simply say we have a bunch of risks to civilization's ability to continue, to continue well, that are real worth considering and different than they were historically.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
It's also worth stating that most early civilizations don't still exist.

07:22.000 --> 07:31.000
There is no more Egyptian or Ottoman or Byzantine or Mayan empire, and the collapse of those civilizations has been academically studied, but they weren't global civilizations.

07:31.000 --> 07:44.000
So there is some precedent that civilizations have a life cycle. We have the first six continent global civilization, meaning the tech that is recording this can't be made in any country in the world.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
The internet that is broadcasting this to people requires this global civilization to produce.

07:51.000 --> 07:58.000
So metacrisis. I think everyone is aware of there's a lot of risks that we face.

07:58.000 --> 08:06.000
And we can look at the economic drivers in terms of perverse incentives and externalised costs.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
We can look at the game theoretic rival risk drivers in terms of arms races and tragedy of the commons.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
We can look at the theory of technology, the way that technology itself ends up shaping mind.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.000
We can obviously look at things deep in the nature of human psychology, our value systems, our cognition.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
It's pretty clear when we look around that none of the other animals or plants are causing possible self-induced extinction of planetary systems.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
There's no planetary boundaries as a result of the activity of deer or algae or oak trees.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
So there's something unique about humans. Is this innate to human nature and there's no way of escaping it?

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
Is this something that human nature can do but is not the only thing it can do?

08:53.000 --> 09:00.000
It can be conditioned, it could be conditioned differently. This is what we're here to explore today.

09:00.000 --> 09:09.000
Ian, obviously your book The Master and his Emissary kind of answers this question in a way,

09:09.000 --> 09:19.000
which is, though it's coming from a different angle, getting the master and emissary wrong would be said to be the cause of all the crises that we face, the situation we're in.

09:19.000 --> 09:28.000
For those who don't already have that framework, do you want to share your introductory thoughts on the human condition that has brought us here?

09:28.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes, I agree with you wholeheartedly that we need to look for underlying causes of a whole pattern of events that are not just unfortunate things that happen to happen.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
We were doing very well and then suddenly people said the climate was changing and the seas were polluted and so forth.

09:50.000 --> 10:01.000
There's a whole range of events that can be traced back to the inevitable consequence of a certain way of looking at the world.

10:01.000 --> 10:17.000
And that way of looking at the world is, in my view, associated with and driven by a model of the world that is present to the left hemisphere in a way that is not the case with the right hemisphere.

10:17.000 --> 10:26.000
In brief, the right hemisphere seems to be more in touch with presence, with what actually experience comes to us and what we inhabit.

10:26.000 --> 10:38.000
Whereas the left hemisphere is providing a representation, no longer the presence, but a map, a program, a theory, a diagram,

10:38.000 --> 10:48.000
but something abstracted, categorical, removed from and not having the characteristics of the world that it is intending to map.

10:48.000 --> 11:03.000
Now, I mean, I should say that to anybody who doesn't know my work, you've probably heard that everything to do with hemispheres is wrong and that it's outmoded and science has got past it.

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
This is not true. If you don't know my work, then forget almost everything you think you know about hemisphere differences.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
They're not the ones that you were told.

11:13.000 --> 11:20.000
But there are, although we got the differences largely wrong, not entirely wrong, but mainly wrong.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
That doesn't mean to say that there are no differences and it wouldn't be important to find out what those differences are.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That's something I've researched for about 30 years.

11:29.000 --> 11:44.000
And in short, the difference comes down to ultimately a mode of attention, which is an evolutionary development that goes back pretty much as far as we can trace it.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
We think back to trilobites and possibly even beyond.

11:48.000 --> 12:00.000
So this is something in which there needs to be two ways of attending to the world that are both very important but appear to be mutually incompatible.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
One is that with which we grasp things. We need to get things in order to survive.

12:05.000 --> 12:11.000
We need to get food. We need to handle twigs to build a nest or sticks to build a shelter, whatever it is.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
We need to be able to latch on to something, precisely target it and get it.

12:15.000 --> 12:26.000
And that's so important that, in a way, one whole half of one's brain is largely geared to this particular end, that of power.

12:26.000 --> 12:33.000
But if you pay only that attention to the world, then you will be very vulnerable because you won't see the predator.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
You won't see your conspecifics. You won't see everything else that's going on of which you need to be aware.

12:39.000 --> 12:49.000
And so, effectively, this is a difference in which one hemisphere pays a very narrowly targeted, precise attention to a detail in order to grab it.

12:49.000 --> 12:56.000
And another kind of attention which is broad, open, sustained and vigilant and on the lookout for everything else.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Putting it very simply.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Those two kinds of attention change what we find.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
No neurodigital world will dispute that the two hemispheres attend differently. It's very clear they do.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
And no philosopher will dispute the fact that attention changes what it is you see.

13:13.000 --> 13:20.000
So, at the end of this, fairly obviously, if we attend in two different ways, we see two different worlds.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm going to grossly simplify here.

13:25.000 --> 13:32.000
But effectively, in one, that of the left hemisphere, the world is made up of little bits that attract attention.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And they're things that we're already targeted on because we know we want them.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
They're isolated, they're decontextualized, they belong to categories, they're abstracted and effectively lifeless.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
Whereas in the right hemisphere, it sees that everything is ultimately connected.

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
It's connected, obviously, to the context of things that are immediately around it, particularly powerful, but it's ultimately connected to everything beyond that.

13:58.000 --> 14:03.000
That the world is never fixed in the way the left hemisphere needs to fix things in order to grab them.

14:03.000 --> 14:11.000
It's not built up out of slices or pieces, but is, in fact, a whole seamless flow, a very important word.

14:11.000 --> 14:18.000
And in this right hemisphere, implicit meaning is understood because that's contextualized.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
And part of the context of that is emotion, the body, other people, the world at large.

14:24.000 --> 14:33.000
You've got a kind of mechanistic reductionist world, subtended by the left hemisphere, which is just a representation or a useful diagram.

14:33.000 --> 14:41.000
And you've got a living, complex world, on the other hand, which has characteristics which are very much harder to pin down,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
but involve all the richness and meaning in life.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
So what I believe, and in the masternities I'm assuming my earlier book I traced in the second part,

14:51.000 --> 14:59.000
a sort of path through the history of the West from the ancient Greeks to the modern time, in which there were rises and fallings of civilization,

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
and in which what happened was that in each civilization, the two ways of seeing the world were used fruitfully together.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
And this is not a difference just between science and the arts.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Science needs both kinds of attention. The arts need both kinds of attention.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
And this is how they flourished to begin with and were highly creative, but over a length of time they overreached themselves.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
They became too big. They became stereotypes.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
They needed global administration that could be rolled out to parts of an empire.

15:27.000 --> 15:39.000
And so we entered into a world very much like that of the left hemisphere and very soon the civilization, either the Greek or the Roman collapsed after this moment appeared.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I mean, a complex story, but that's it in our play.

15:42.000 --> 15:54.000
And I think that we're in another, a third wave of this, if you like, in the West, which began in the Renaissance with an incredible flourishing

15:54.000 --> 16:06.000
and almost unequaled anywhere in the world at any time of everything, of interest in the sciences, in the heavens, in art, in sculpture, in music, in poetry.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
This is an incredibly rich time.

16:09.000 --> 16:20.000
And then from about the end of the 17th century, very roughly, with the scientific revolution, we began to believe that we could understand everything in terms of mechanisms.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
And this was a useful way to think and indeed let me be the first to say that we have benefited from it in many ways.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
We have developments that very few of us would wish to be without as a result of it.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
But unfortunately, it led to a philosophical error.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And it's not just as it were a philosophical error in an abstract way.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
It's one that runs deep to the nature of how we experience the world.

16:43.000 --> 16:52.000
That is, we believe that the world is made up of parts and that we find reality by going down and down and down until we've got bits that are almost identical to one another.

16:52.000 --> 17:00.000
Whereas in fact, almost the opposite is true, that everything happens out of the coming together into complex holes.

17:00.000 --> 17:11.000
Now, when I say coming together, I'm suggesting that we do actually temporarily start from, or temporarily, from parts, but we don't.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
In our minds, in the left hemisphere, we start from parts, but in reality, things are whole.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
And what we call parts are holes of another level and they can't be understood only by the parts.

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
This is a theory which is sometimes called a Gestalt theory, because the Germans have this word Gestalt, which we don't have an exact equivalent,

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
or which means a hole which cannot be accounted for by the sum of the pieces, the parts.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
We've lost that insight.

17:38.000 --> 17:48.000
And I think that what has happened is that a combination of factors, and it's not exhaustive, but the rise of capitalism, the development of empires,

17:49.000 --> 18:02.000
both geographical empires and commercial empires, thinking in terms of global generalizations have led us away from the reality,

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
which is always unique, implicit, wrapped up with value, not just being sort of facts on their own.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
Which is not to say, by the way, that I don't have any tract myself with the idea that we all just make it all up to suit ourselves.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
No, that's not the case.

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
But nonetheless, our reality is something we experience as a relationship between us observing and whatever it is that it's observed.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
And this goes both ways.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
We are affected by it and we affect what we see.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
We literally change what there is there to see.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
Now, that vision is quite different from the one we have, that if only we can master more and more using left hemisphere kinds of mechanism,

18:46.000 --> 18:52.000
we will achieve power and power will make us happy, but the roots of happiness are very other than that.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm sure we'll come on to that.

18:54.000 --> 19:03.000
But effectively, we think we've accounted for everything when we think in terms of matter, but much more important are values, a sense of purpose.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
And as far as I'm concerned, a sense of the sacred.

19:06.000 --> 19:13.000
That's really where we're at. And I think recovering some of what we've lost is critical to making any progress.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
We can't just stick sticking plasters on the cancer.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
We need to eradicate the cause and change the way in which we think about ourselves, the world and how we relate to it.

19:25.000 --> 19:34.000
Before we move to John's opening comments for those who aren't familiar, would you explain why you use the term master in emissary?

19:34.000 --> 19:44.000
This is a kind of a fable in which there is a wise spiritual master who looks after a small community so well that it flourishes and grows.

19:44.000 --> 19:53.000
After a while, he realizes he can't look after all the business of the community himself, not just because there's now too much of it, which is part of it,

19:53.000 --> 20:02.000
but also because if he's to maintain his overall vision and to see the whole, he mustn't get distracted by detailed bureaucratic concerns.

20:02.000 --> 20:11.000
So he appoints his brightest and best to be his emissary and go about and do the administrative stuff, a high level assistant.

20:11.000 --> 20:19.000
And unfortunately, that assistant is hubristic, knowing much less than the master he thinks he knows at all.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
And he thinks, in fact, of course, he is the real master.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
And because of his lack of knowledge of what it is he doesn't know, he, the master and the civilization fall into ruins.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
And that obviously is an allegory, which could be applied, I believe can be directly applied to the idea of the relationship between these hemispheres,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
because one of them actually sees much more is wiser.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And, you know, I'm not just using figures of speech.

20:46.000 --> 20:56.000
We know, and in the book I demonstrate how we know that the right hemisphere is not just more emotionally and socially intelligent, which many people might assume is the case,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
but also more cognitively intelligent.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
So that where we have some evidence about what has happened to somebody's IQ.

21:05.000 --> 21:15.000
We have measurements before and after say a stroke, where there has been a significant drop in IQ, the insult is almost always in the right hemisphere.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
So it's very important that the right hemisphere should remain the position of the master.

21:21.000 --> 21:28.000
And as long as the emissary follows the direction of the master that sees more, it's very helpful and useful.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
It's a good servant of the very poor master.

21:33.000 --> 21:44.000
So the question of why in the global civilization, the emissary became dominant relative to the master is something I want to get back to.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
But thank you very much, those great opening.

21:47.000 --> 21:57.000
And something I should have shared in the opening is I have tremendous respect for both Ian and John's work.

21:57.000 --> 22:13.000
Both have done these kind of very deep histories of Western philosophy and very meaningful worldviews that address the nature of mind, the meaning crisis.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And yeah, I'm very honored to be in the conversation.

22:16.000 --> 22:23.000
It's why I wanted to get both of your perspectives on the underlying drivers of the metacrisis that are inside of human mind experience and cognition.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
So John, similarly, I would love to hear your opening thoughts.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
You've done very deep presentation of what you call the meaning crisis.

22:32.000 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, and what I'd like to do as well as I'm doing my presentation, I'd like to show some deep lines of convergence with Ian and I have spoken before.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
And we've often realized that there's a lot of convergence.

22:47.000 --> 22:56.000
And one of the things I'm hoping to do is in this with you, but for us to unpack that even more because we have more limited conversations in the past.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
So I'm going to start, I will get back to the history in a minute.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
I want to start with the present.

23:03.000 --> 23:12.000
Okay, 2019 national survey, very comprehensive survey, 80% of people found that their lives are meaningless.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Interesting.

23:14.000 --> 23:26.000
43% think that's because of financial reason and that goes against a lot of the data that we have that once your finances get you out of poverty, they do not contribute very much to meaning in life.

23:26.000 --> 23:36.000
34% seem to be getting a little bit closer, at least in an intuitive way, when they they attribute their lack of meaning to anxiety.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And let's just be very careful about this.

23:38.000 --> 23:48.000
Anxiety isn't the same thing as fear fear you have a definite object something the left hemisphere with very much there's the definitive thing I can point my attention to it and focus on it hard.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
Anxiety tends to be more atmospheric.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
It is generally associated with the right hemisphere.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
And so what you've got with anxiety is you've got a negligent sense of disconnection.

24:02.000 --> 24:10.000
And this brings with it a sense of concern arousal stress.

24:10.000 --> 24:17.000
And of course, horror is exactly the aesthetic of when you feel like you're losing a grip on reality.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
So anxiety is on the same arc as horror.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Most of our horror movies are not actually horror movies.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
They're just startle movies where somebody something jumps out at you and scares you but genuine horror movies.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
They give you a sense of what I'm talking about.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
No, anxiety is low grade horror in that sense.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
So people are drifting along.

24:35.000 --> 24:50.000
And then what we can ask is there's what does that have significant consequences and we know from the extensive literature on meaning in life, not meaning of life, which I'll make a distinction in a few minutes, meaning in life or a related psychological literature,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
especially the work of Kelly Allen, the sense of belonging.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
You don't have meaning in life if you don't have a sense of belonging you're in serious trouble.

24:57.000 --> 25:08.000
Psychologically, physiologically, socially, probably predictively your overall health, probably your social economic status is predictive of lots of stuff going bad.

25:08.000 --> 25:18.000
Of course, it's ultimately predictive of anxiety and depression, which by the way are flip sides of the same overall disorientation, disconnection problem.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
It's predictive of course of suicide.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
Although Tatya and Chanel has found evidence that people don't have to go through clinical depression.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
Contrary to what we think, they can just experience meaninglessness and go right to suicide without going through clinical depression.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So just on its own it's predictive too.

25:36.000 --> 25:48.000
So 80% of a population has the state that we have pretty comprehensive evidence is very deleterious to their health.

25:48.000 --> 25:55.000
And then you have a lot of sort of cultural sense that this is happening.

25:55.000 --> 26:02.000
So the book I did with Christopher Master Pietro and Philip Misovic on zombies, what did zombies become so prevalent?

26:02.000 --> 26:13.000
And the idea is zombies are a mythgram that has arisen to sort of express, not necessarily articulate or explain, but express meaning crisis.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We'll think about them, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
They lead by definition meaningless lives.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
They've lost intelligibility.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
They can't speak.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
They move in collectivities, but they form no communities.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
They drift aimlessly.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.000
Unlike other monsters, they don't have any supernatural connection.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
They're just us decayed and perpetually decayed.

26:33.000 --> 26:39.000
They're a perversion of the Christian myth of resurrection because they do not come back to the fuller life.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
They come back to the lesser life.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
And then they got, they got linked to another Christian myth, the apocalypse, which was supposed to be the renewal of the world.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
But instead it's the ongoing endless decadence of the world.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
So the zombie mythology is a cultural expression of this.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
And you can also see all kinds of symptoms.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Of course, we have the mental health issues.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
Death of despair in the United States and the UK are becoming serious, serious problems related phenomena.

27:06.000 --> 27:18.000
The UK has set up this Orwellian thing called the Ministry of Loneliness, which is like, because the number of close friends we've been having has gone down.

27:18.000 --> 27:28.000
And Eberstadt has shown in her book, how the West really lost God is this also has what you might call philosophical, even spiritual consequences.

27:28.000 --> 27:41.000
Because there's a direct correlation between how much people live atomically and alone and how secular the society has become and how sort of shallow people's ontology.

27:41.000 --> 27:47.000
Yes, I'm not sure about her causal picture, but the correlation is just undeniable.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
So this is having huge effects.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
You get it in the virtual exodus.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
People want to live in the virtual world rather than the real world.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
They express this as an explosive thing.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
And I think we can get a bit of insight into what's going on.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
What's missing in the meaning processes?

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
What are they finding there that they're not finding here?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
But let me just finish a couple more symptoms.

28:08.000 --> 28:23.000
We've got the weird political paradox that everybody feels disillusioned and disenfranchised, but the political sphere has been has been now reappropriated and filled with religious fervor and symbolic religious behavior.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
And we've given over identity and a meaning in life to our political ideologies.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Even though we've lost faith in all of the institutions, weird thing.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You have positive symptoms though.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
You have the mindfulness revolution.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
People are seeking fundamental transformation in attention awareness.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
You have the rise of ancient wisdom philosophies.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
There are more stoics now alive than we're ever alive in the Roman Empire.

28:46.000 --> 29:01.000
And of course you have the ongoing thing basically from Schopenhauer on of the increasing investigations into Asiatic philosophies in which philosophy and spirituality, knowledge and wisdom were not separated.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
And so that whole symptomology.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Let's go back to the video game.

29:06.000 --> 29:12.000
What are they getting in a video game that they're obviously lacking in the real world?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Well, what they have is they have a narrative structure.

29:14.000 --> 29:23.000
There's a narrative structure that tells them what the story is and what part they play in it and audience them towards a purpose.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
So purpose.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
They have a nomological structure.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.000
What do I mean by that?

29:28.000 --> 29:33.000
They have a sense of there's a set of rules, laws and rules that make sense of that world.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
So they understand how that world works.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
This is intelligibility of coherence.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
Second, that purpose coherence.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Third, what else is going on in that?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Well, they have a normative structure.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
They know how to self-transcend.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
They can level up.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
There's a way in which self-transcendence is available to them.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
And fourth, they get into the flow state.

29:55.000 --> 30:01.000
They get into a state where they feel dynamically coupled and connected to their environment.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
So what do we have?

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
These are the four factors of meaning in life.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
These are the things that you have when you have meaning in life.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And contrary to what our culture says,

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
purpose is one of them, but purpose is not the synonym for all of them,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
nor is it the most important of the dimensions.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
You need to have purpose, but it's not the same as meaning in life,

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
nor is it sufficient for meaning in life.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
The next, coherence.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
The world can't be absurd to people.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
Third, you need significance.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
What that means is you need something that gives you a normative staircase,

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
something that gives you a way by which you can get in touch with the really real.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
We've got from the psychedelic renaissance and the work in Mystical Experience,

30:50.000 --> 30:59.000
and I'm involved in that, that people seek out for its own sake this relationship with the really real, the more real.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
And once they get it, they will, they're willing to change their whole lives

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
so that they are in deeper contact with that really real.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
And Yadin has shown their lives actually by many objective measures get better.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
So that matters.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
The third one, the flow state.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
The flow state is a very powerful, and Chik-Sent-Maha'i has done a lot of work on that.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
We could perhaps talk about that.

31:20.000 --> 31:25.000
The flow state is a very powerful version of the fourth factor, which is mattering.

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
People need to feel that they are connected to something that has a reality and a value beyond their own individual existence.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
So to find this out, you ask somebody, what do you want to exist even if you don't?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
And how much of a difference do you make to it now?

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
You could grab all of these things together, and they all fold into this connectedness in sense-making.

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
We're connected to the world, we're ordered to the world, the world makes fundamental sense to us.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.000
We fit into the world, we belong in the world, belonging, sense of belonging, sense of meaning, and love.

31:57.000 --> 32:07.000
My proposal is that that can ultimately be understood as reflecting sort of the core of human cognition.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I talk about the core four.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
I think we've split them up for analytic reasons, right?

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
Which is attention, consciousness, working memory, and fluid general intelligence.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
But I think they're all just four different dimensions of an underlying core thing.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
And there's good functional evidence, behavioral evidence, and anatomical evidence for that claim.

32:28.000 --> 32:34.000
I won't review all of that, but I'll just take it that that could be agreed without much controversy.

32:34.000 --> 32:52.000
What I think those, that general ability, that general intelligence reflects is it reflects two metaproblems that you have to solve whenever you're solving any problem you're trying to solve in the world.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
And I understand there's two kinds of problems.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
There's problems that are solved by having something, controlling it, and there are problems that are solved by becoming something.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
From's distinction, which maps on a lot also to the left and right in many ways.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And we'll get back to that.

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
But what I think these two metaproblems are, and think about your intuition.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.000
We tend to attribute intelligence to a creature the more we can see reliable evidence that it can anticipate its world.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Because, of course, an ounce of prevention.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.000
The more you can anticipate the world, the more powerful your causal intervention.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
If I can avoid the tiger, that's way less costly than fighting the tiger, just to put, right.

33:32.000 --> 33:47.000
And so the thing is, as you push out sort of the light cone of your anticipation of the world, what you get is you get an explosion of the amount of information, all the possible alternative pathways to get into your goal.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
This just explodes in possibility.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
So even to take a very limited case, here's my initial state.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
I'm starting a game of chess.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
I'm trying to get to the end.

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
All the number of alternative pathways outnumbers the number of atomic particles in the universe.

34:01.000 --> 34:08.000
And this is one of the core problems going back to Newell and Simon that is at the heart of the AGI project, right.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
And so this is what you can't do.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You can't check all that information.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
Think about all the things I could pay attention to.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
It's overwhelming.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Think about all the things I could remember.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
Think about all the different combinations of sequences of sounds and movements.

34:23.000 --> 34:30.000
And yet what we're all doing is we're just zeroing in on it right now.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
And what that means is it's not that you check everything.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.000
You can't.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
That would take the rest of your life.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
Somehow, and this is really important, you ignore most of what's relevant.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Sorry, you ignore most of what's irrelevant.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
You ignore it.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
You zero in on what's relevant.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Now that's not cold calculation.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
And this is where I, like, this is a matter of care.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
We're different from AGI still.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
How long is something we could potentially call.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
We care about the information we're processing.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
Computers don't.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
We care about whether or not it's true.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Computers don't, right.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
So it's not just that relevance is not just, it's not just a calculation.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
It's a matter of caring.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
It's a matter of commitment because whenever I'm doing this, I'm taking a chance.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
I have to commit to this because when I'm paying attention to Ian, I'm not paying attention to what's behind me.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
There's a cost.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
There's always a cost.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
So there's existential risk at whenever I'm doing it.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
So there's caring, committed, connectedness.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
And notice relevance is a connecting relation.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.000
It's like biological fittedness, right?

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Relevance isn't in the object.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
It isn't in the subject.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
Relevance is that would bind this objective and the objective together.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
I call it transjective, right?

35:54.000 --> 36:05.000
So that and for the name for all of that I use is religio, the sense of binding that carries with it a sense of profound meaning.

36:05.000 --> 36:20.000
And I put it to you that when people have access to profound meaning in all of these dimensions, they get a sense of the sacred and inexhaustible fountive intelligibility that is not just an intellectual affair, but this connected living affair.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.000
But here's the problem.

36:24.000 --> 36:32.000
The very processes that make you intelligently adaptive make you perpetually prone to self deception.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
This is my reinterpretation of the first noble truth, right?

36:36.000 --> 36:45.000
Because the very process that gets me to be adaptive by focusing in and binding myself.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
I mean this seriously.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
This is normative for me and bound.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.000
This is what I should do.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I should be paying attention to Ian.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
It means I'm ignoring so much.

36:55.000 --> 37:03.000
And often what we ignore can turn out to be the relevant information that we actually need to solve whatever problems we're facing.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
So we are perpetually prone to self deception.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
And I want to talk just a little bit about this is at multiple levels.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
But what that means is and this is a trade off relationship.

37:16.000 --> 37:24.000
Whenever you try and solve one way in which you're being deceived, you open yourself up to an alternative way in which you can be.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So I should pay attention to it.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
No, no, no.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
And then I'll lose the right.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
I'm always in a trade off between what should I foreground?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
What should I background?

37:33.000 --> 37:38.000
And so it's a very complex process.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
It's very complex.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
It's very dynamic.

37:41.000 --> 37:46.000
It's co-created by the world and me and also me and other people.

37:46.000 --> 37:53.000
Very complex, very dynamic, very adaptive, very prone to self deceptive,

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
self destructive behavior, both individually and collectively.

37:57.000 --> 38:04.000
So cultures across the world have had to deal with this really tricky problem.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
How do we ameliorate the self deception without undermining the adaptive connectedness?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Because we can't just shut it off.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
And we have all these trade offs.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
We can't just pursue simple panaceas that will just do this.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
So we have to get this complex.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
I call it an ecology of practices practices that intervene.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
And our cognition, our attention, our awareness in multiple places in checks and balances.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
Very like think of the eight fold path of Buddhism.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's this complex set of practices.

38:34.000 --> 38:39.000
And they're represented by a spoke wheel because they all interconnect and they're all self organizing.

38:39.000 --> 38:46.000
And when you do that, you need to set that within a community that homes you.

38:46.000 --> 38:51.000
Because you need people who have been practicing it because this is just this is not a matter just of theory.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
This is a matter of transformation.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
And they need to be able to guide you along the way.

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
And then that community has to be set in a world view that legitimates it.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
A world view that legitimates it.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.000
So another way of understanding the meeting crisis is that unlike most cultures,

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
we don't know where to go to cultivate wisdom.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
We don't know where to go to ameliorate that self deceptive, self destructive behavior, foolishness.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
We don't know where to go to enhance the connectedness, the religious.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
So it gets us into deep connection.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
And we used to have a world view that gave us both of that.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
This is how you connect deeper.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
And this is how you overcome your fallenness of all use of metaphor.

39:33.000 --> 39:39.000
And that was the sacred, the sacred canopy, the religious frameworks were the places that gave us world views,

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
traditions and ecologies of practices for addressing this.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
And because of the Protestant Reformation, the scientific revolution,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
actually I would even start it in medieval nominalism.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Yes, I agree.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
Thank you.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
And a lot of things.

39:53.000 --> 40:01.000
And then this has just been put on methamphetamine basically since the advent of some of the hyper technologies.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
We are in a position where we don't have a sacred canopy.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
We don't have a, I asked my students, where do you go for information?

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
They have their phones.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
Where do you go for science?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
They're sort of hesitant, postmodern concern.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
But I guess, you know, I go to science for knowledge, right?

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
That's the reasoning what the words Kansasia actually just meant was knowledge.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.000
Then I ask them where they go for wisdom and they don't have an answer.

40:25.000 --> 40:37.000
And they know that without wisdom, meaning in life is tremendously at risk.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
There are so many things in that that I would love to respond to.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
But I don't, I mean, perhaps Andrew, you would like to talk.

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
Yeah, I mean, I think we get to play with relevance realization in real time.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
Because I would like to go into zombies and video games and all kinds of things,

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
but feeling into the highest useful, the questions on my mind,

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I'd like to hear what's on yours is.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
So thank you.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.000
And both having shared kind of opening frames.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.000
Two top questions for both of you is ideology.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
So how did we get here?

41:11.000 --> 41:15.000
How did we get to ubiquitous meaninglessness and nowhere to go for wisdom?

41:15.000 --> 41:18.000
How did we get to the master and the emissary backwards culturally?

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
And what is the relationship between this interior psychological phenomena

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
and the objective environmental catastrophes, nuclear risk,

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
AI risk, economic issues that we have in the world?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
So how did we get here?

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
And how does the interior and the exterior relate?

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
What are the kind of causal dynamics, both directions?

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
I would love to hear.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
Perhaps you wouldn't mind if I don't immediately address those questions.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
But you've got somewhere else.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
Some more burning things that came up and we can come to that as you've announced them

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
and we will come to them, I'm sure.

41:56.000 --> 42:02.000
One was a reflection on what you were saying at the end, John,

42:02.000 --> 42:10.000
about we can only attend to so much, we can only remember so much,

42:10.000 --> 42:16.000
and we all need to balance the benefits and risks of everything we do carry.

42:16.000 --> 42:22.000
As Heidegger said, every revelation of truth is the hiding of something.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
And I think that is really important.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.000
And what this brings to mind for me is a couple of things.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
One is that filtering is creative.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
That if you like filtering of light is how we get coloured patterns,

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
we get films and so forth, life like a dome of many coloured glass stains,

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
the white gradients of eternity, Shelley.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
So less is often more.

42:51.000 --> 42:56.000
And part of shaping and intelligence is knowing what to get rid of

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
because you try to take too much and it wouldn't benefit.

43:00.000 --> 43:05.000
The other thing about it is that it's not just a trade-off in the sense,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
well, we need a bit of this and we need a bit of that.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
That is kind of true.

43:09.000 --> 43:19.000
But everything contains within it, if viewed in my mind anyway, if viewed as a whole.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
It has a relationship with its opposite.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
And it only exists because of the being an opposite.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
So it's like the two poles of a bar magnet.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
You can't have the north or the south because they coexist and co-create.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
And so what one is trying to do is rather like in the magnet

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
or in a torched string of a musical instrument or the torched string of a bow,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
is to hold two things together that both need to be held,

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
just go flabbily to a point in the middle because then the string goes slack

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000
and you've got no power for the arrow to fly or the note to take off from the loop.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
So I think that's something important that we ought to bear in mind

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
is this relationship between the thing and its opposite.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.000
Actually, it also, if I may say, because I was listening to your talk last night,

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
or the night before, to the Consilience Conference.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
And one of the things I think there was this idea that,

44:18.000 --> 44:23.000
well, you made a lot of interesting points,

44:23.000 --> 44:28.000
but one of them was to do with, I've forgotten it.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.000
What was the transjective relating the subject of an object?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Yeah, there's a bit of that.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Well, there might have been something, and maybe because, let me try,

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
maybe there's a wrong, one of the things I was trying to emphasize

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
and one of the things that a recovery of Neoplatonism,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
especially given filler's work on it,

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
can give us is a re-emphasis on the polarity rather than the poles.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And I was talking about this.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
I try to use the Greek word tonos rather than tension.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
I do too.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Yeah, because the English word tension is almost purely negative now for us.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah, that's right.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Tonos, like Heraclitus, the tonos of the boat.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
The tautness of the string, yeah.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
And without the tautness, there is no energy.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
That's right.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.000
And whatever comes out of the tautness is orthogonal to the tautness.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.000
And that's so the arrow flies off at right angles and notes come out in a way.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
So it's a very important aspect of creativity.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
I just wanted to reflect on that.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
I wanted to comment very briefly on what you said about anxiety in the hemispheres.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
Yeah.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
I don't think anxiety and depression in my experience are just parts of the same thing.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I think they're actually, they can coexist,

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
but they're not the same thing at all and they don't need to coexist.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Anxiety, I think, is not lateralized.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
So I think there is anxiety created by the left and by the right hemisphere and each of them holds it.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
Depression is a complex one and I don't want to go into it in any detail,

45:54.000 --> 46:05.000
but some depressions seem to me to be due to an unbalanced overactivity or unopposed activity of the right frontal cortex.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
And that can be unopposed either by the left frontal cortex or by the right posterior cortex.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Yes.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
So it's slightly complicated.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
I just want to put that on record because people may go away and say,

46:14.000 --> 46:19.000
well, I thought you said, you know, and that's not what anywhere I said, but...

46:21.000 --> 46:29.000
I was just trying to, yeah, I was trying to indicate that the phenomenology tends to be much more atmosphere in both of those.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
Depression and anxiety rather than narrow focus.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
It's wide focused and ambiguous rather than...

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
To that extent, yes.

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
But actually in terms of where they originate hemisphere wise,

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
I think it's hard to be more specific in the way you seem to be saying.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
And then there are just a couple of other things that I want to pick up because we don't have to exhaust them.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
We can't exhaust them now, but we would want to sort of perhaps come to them.

46:56.000 --> 47:03.000
One is about purpose and its nature and the other is about values and meaning.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
So I agree with you that meaning and purpose are not the same thing,

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
but it's very important to make a distinction that will be familiar to all three of us,

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
but may not be in the minds of some people watching or listening.

47:18.000 --> 47:23.000
And that is the difference between what I call extrinsic purpose and intrinsic purpose.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
An example of extrinsic purpose is a photocopier.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
Its purpose is it was created to copy a sheet of paper and make another image.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
But the other thing is that the purpose doesn't lie outside itself, but in itself.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
They are in themselves purposeful.

47:39.000 --> 47:44.000
Actually, I believe the prayers of this kind, it's in itself valuable, not because it produces a result,

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
but also very obviously things like music and dance are not pointless,

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
but they're not validated by a purpose that comes out, we have better health for it.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
No, they have value in themselves.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
And the last thing I just wanted to raise and say that when we're going forward,

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
we can come back to and preference these things is that very often people,

48:06.000 --> 48:11.000
I mean, you said that we need meaning and we need to be directed.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
And I believe that values are things that draw us from in front rather than pushes from behind

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
and purpose also beckons to us from in front and draws us forward.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
And of course, all our models are pushed from behind because they're mechanical,

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
but very importantly, these things exist as it were at the same time as our striving towards them

48:30.000 --> 48:34.000
and actually cause us to strive towards them, not by pushing us,

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
but by calling to us, evoking a response.

48:37.000 --> 48:46.000
And that we ought to be careful not to think that because of a frailty of the human spirit,

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
we must find meaning in a basically meaning those cosmos.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
We must paint values on the walls of ourselves.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
So you're not saying this, but I just thought it would be worth clarifying.

48:57.000 --> 49:04.000
We don't have to sort of cheer ourselves up by painting pretty pictures on the walls of a hermetically sealed cell.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
I reject that completely and I imagine you do too.

49:07.000 --> 49:15.000
Indeed, we are contacting something which is real and I actually think that those values and purpose are essential to the cosmos.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
They're not things we made up.

49:18.000 --> 49:23.000
So I don't want to exclude Daniel from the conversation, but I feel called to respond, but I want to make this a place for you.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
I have some questions I'll follow up with, but please go ahead.

49:27.000 --> 49:35.000
So, yeah, I mean, that distinction that you made, and this is just to provide convergence,

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
like it's well established in the lit, you know,

49:38.000 --> 49:48.000
Emma Bile talked about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and then the intrinsic motivation is much more predictive of creativity and insight than extrinsic.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
But you actually need a bit.

49:50.000 --> 49:59.000
Optimal creativity is to have a mixture of the two because you need the extrinsic when you're painting the Sistine Chapel and you're painting the blue of the sky and you just got to keep going.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Right.

50:01.000 --> 50:08.000
And it also gives you corrective feedback because if you're just intrinsic, you don't have external judges and things like that.

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
But yes, I think that's important.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
And I think that brings out an important difference.

50:14.000 --> 50:24.000
I think the things that we think are intrinsically motivated, motivating are precisely the ones that get us into that state of connectedness, religio.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
Optimal intrinsic motivation being realized as a flow state, you do the flow state to be in the flow state.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
You don't do it for any other reason.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
Right.

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
And that sense of it, one minute, that sense of super salience, that's the beginning of the taste of the sacred as well.

50:38.000 --> 50:51.000
And so I think the sacred is how does reality disclose itself to us where we're in that mode of not work, but serious play that we're doing for its own sake because all we're doing like playing music or going to a play.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
Yes.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
We're playing with relevance realization.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
In this serious sense, we're playing with it.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
And we're playing with salience and we're saying, if I play with this, what kind of world is available to me?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
And I agree.

51:05.000 --> 51:15.000
I think, especially given the work of L.A. Paul and Agnes Calard and aspiration, that we need to bring back the aspirational dimension, that we are bound.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Right.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
We're bound to the future in the right way.

51:18.000 --> 51:23.000
And what's come out of this, and this is, it allows me to make another point.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
And I know we have different language about this, but I think we converged.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
It's interesting.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
It's part of what's come out of the way to do this is to quickly describe an experiment.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Okay.

51:33.000 --> 51:42.000
So you go into a bunch of academics and you say, you give them all the evidence, all the arguments that they should start saving for retirement right now.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
Take any challenges, any questions.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
You come back in six months, none of them are saving.

51:47.000 --> 51:57.000
And that's to do with what's called hyperbolic discounting and the way our evolutionary machinery makes distance, things in the, in the distance, much less salient to us than currents.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
And that's why you procrastinate.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
It's why you eat the chocolate cake when you're trying to lose weight.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Right.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
And it's very adaptive because you don't get that.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You're just overwhelmed by possibilities.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Right.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
But now you come back to them and you say, okay, what I want you to do is I want you to practice this every day.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Notice it's a practice, not just a belief.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I want you to practice every day.

52:15.000 --> 52:29.000
I want you to practice like imagining and we should talk about two kinds of imagination at some point, but I want you to imagine your future self as a family, a beloved family member that you've always cared for and you need to continue caring for them.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
And you have a lot of compassion and love for them.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
And I want you to do that every day.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
And you come back in six months and you find two things.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Now they're saving.

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
And the ones that do the practice more regularly and more vividly imagine it.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Save more.

52:45.000 --> 52:56.000
You see what this is showing that the imaginal augmentation of the aspiration to do something actually is a constitutive part of being rational.

52:56.000 --> 53:04.000
Descartes reduced logos since making rationality to computation.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
And we've lost the fact.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
No, no, no.

53:07.000 --> 53:14.000
If I'm actually going, and this is Agnes Kellert's argument, if I'm trying to become more rational, that's an aspirational project.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
That's me trying to become somebody other than whom I am.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.000
I have to bind myself to my future self.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
This is religio again.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
I have to get religio with my future self.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
And that's not something that I can do just inferentially.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
I have to do this using imagination.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I have to use this with connect.

53:30.000 --> 53:38.000
I agree with you profoundly that even the, even the attempts to be more rational require an aspirate.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
So aspiration and rationality have to be rebound together.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah.

53:43.000 --> 53:56.000
One thing I want to push back on, but just because I know you've got, see, I'm hesitant around the word value because the notion of value comes up basically in the enlightenment.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
And it's part of the is, ought distinction and things like that.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Okay.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Do you want to challenge that?

54:04.000 --> 54:12.000
Because you don't, you don't have, you don't have this notion sort of predating the idea that value is right.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I think we're talking about terminology.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Okay.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.000
It would be hard to say that Plato had no allegiance to the values of beauty, goodness and truth.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
I don't call those values.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
Well, you can call them what you like, John, but you know, let's not know what I mean.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
I mean, it's not a lot of people would use different words, but you know what I mean by values.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Well, I do and I don't.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
And this is what, but I want to do what you did with one of my terms.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
I think most people don't hear.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
See, Plato doesn't think we value them.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Plato thinks we love the transcendentals.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
Right.

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
And value is a statement of, right, of choice and preference.

54:44.000 --> 54:53.000
This is how Locke introduces it and makes, and you can actually see him change from, we are called by the world to we choose.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
And he introduces the notion there.

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
And what I want to say that is because I want to make the argument again.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
And this is part of the overall that love is not a purely subjective matter either.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
Love is not a feeling.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Love is not an emotion.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Right.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
When I love somebody that can make me happy.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
It can make me.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
I miss my partner right now because I love her so deeply.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
It can make me angry, frustrated.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
Love isn't an emotion.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
It's a way of binding myself to another person.

55:23.000 --> 55:31.000
And I think when most people hear the word value because of its enlightenment history, they hear choice and preference and what they want.

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
And I don't think if we think we can choose the true and the good and the beautiful.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Okay.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
So clarification.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Yes.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Yes.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
We don't understand that we don't choose them.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
We are called by them and we are called by them to ask to aspire.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Right.

55:46.000 --> 55:51.000
Now, I understand you're not using the word that way, but I think most people when they hear value are using it.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Well, thanks for clarifying that.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
Yeah.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Yeah.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
That's not what that was.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Yes.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
And, you know, there's an important relationship between love and value.

55:59.000 --> 56:06.000
Both Pascal and Shayla said that you can't actually value something until you love it.

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
And most people would think you don't love it until you know how to value it.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
But it's an interesting alternative way of thinking.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Anyway.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
I don't want to say that.

56:15.000 --> 56:22.000
But what I want to bring in that people don't usually hear when they hear value is like Murdoch's point, like in the sovereignty of the good.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
Love is the painful recognition that something other than yourself is real.

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
There's a connectedness to realness that's important if you're actually loving something.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.000
Absolutely.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
Yes.

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
Well, you know, perhaps we should go to love already, but it's a huge topic.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
I mean, and I don't want to lose whatever it was Daniel was going to say.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.000
Yeah.

56:44.000 --> 56:51.000
But I think this was valuable because I think we took a lot of sort of the common language

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
of modernity and even of postmodernity, subjectivity, objectivity, all this stuff.

56:56.000 --> 57:06.000
And we sort of put pressure on it and shown that the presupposition that this is just the natural way thought unfolds needs to be challenged.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
No, no.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
And above all on the subjective, objective divide, which is not to say that the terms have no meaning.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Of course not.

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
But I like you believe that everything comes into being out of a relation.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Yes.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
There's never just that or just in here.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.000
Yes.

57:20.000 --> 57:28.000
But it is the coming together and encounter in fact, which is the root cause of our experience and of our love and our valuing actually.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Yes, yes.

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
But anyway, yeah.

57:33.000 --> 57:41.000
So there's something challenging in what we're trying to do here, which is as we've seen what we take words to mean,

57:41.000 --> 57:48.000
which words we use, what ontologies, what references, what epistemologies, we haven't had time to all sync these.

57:48.000 --> 57:54.000
And as we probably all experience, I certainly have when I want to do generative work with someone that has a different background,

57:54.000 --> 57:59.000
that's where we have to start and realize some of our disagreements are because the word means something different.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
And that takes a long time.

58:01.000 --> 58:08.000
And so I'm noticing that you mentioned intrinsic and extrinsic purpose.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
You said purpose and meaning are not identical, but you didn't make the distinction.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
John responded talking about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which is not the exact same as purpose.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
And then there was a conversation around values.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
There's a conversation around love around beauty.

58:23.000 --> 58:27.000
So these are all related, but not exactly synonymous topics.

58:27.000 --> 58:35.000
They all obviously indicate something that we value, but we're wanting to speak to value being intrinsic to reality,

58:35.000 --> 58:40.000
not just something we make up, which is you saying we're not just painting values on a meaningless universe.

58:40.000 --> 58:48.000
There's something about the ontologies that give us a meaningless universe that are part of the problem that we want to come to,

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
that I think is core to the meaning crisis, core to the place we find ourselves in and why you have to say something like,

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
hey, it's not that the reality is a meaningless universe that we have to paint meaning on,

58:58.000 --> 59:03.000
but that reality has something like intrinsic purpose to it.

59:03.000 --> 59:11.000
So I'm just acknowledging all the really fascinating topics that I'm not going to ask questions about or say anything about,

59:11.000 --> 59:24.000
because in the short amount of time we have, feeling into what has the highest meaningfulness, beauty, worthiness of love, purpose, value,

59:24.000 --> 59:31.000
without making further distinctions on which of those it is.

59:31.000 --> 59:39.000
You said something about the intrinsic versus extrinsic purpose that I wanted to click on a little bit,

59:39.000 --> 59:47.000
because extrinsic purpose being an instrumental or utilitarian concept, the purpose of X is defined by its utility to Y,

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
and we're assuming Y has value.

59:49.000 --> 59:57.000
So when someone takes that definition of purpose, they take purpose first rather than meaning or value or beauty or love.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
They take purpose as the thing that we're looking for, which is itself a very interesting question.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:09.000
They take the relative utilitarian extrinsic definition, then they ask what's the purpose of it all.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:17.000
It's obviously a meaningless question, because there's nothing outside of it all to say it is relevant with respect to,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000
and so it's easy to say, oh, there's no purpose to anything and come up with nihilism as opposed to just recognize it was a category or you were using too small a concept.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Now you're talking about intrinsic purpose or intrinsic beauty or intrinsic something.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Intrinsic something that is worth something, and you're saying that it also has a pulling quality or a telos, right,

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:43.000
that all that is has something like purpose, that is not defined with respect to anything else.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It may be hard to define it all, which the Tao would say, which sounds very much like the Tao, it has a nature, right?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So does the direction of reality or universe reveal something about its nature that is worth aligning ourselves with?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I think it's very interesting.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I want to ask, I want to propose what I think is the generator of the metacrisis in your framework,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
in here your response, and then here you build on it.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But I want to just hear first the definition of purpose as extrinsic, that the philosophy of science can orient to.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
So you have Big Bang where the laws are why they are, because who knows, and the constants are what they are,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:45.000
and at some point consciousness pops out, and it's very easy to get nihilism in that model.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
One could say that model is left-hemispheric dominance epistemically,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
and that the left-hemispheric dominance can't understand purpose or meaning.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Is that how you would say it?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:10.000
When we talk about, or I talk about values, I'm thinking of a hierarchy drawn up by Max Schaler,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
the German early 20th century philosopher, in which he had a hierarchy of values, the base of which was utility.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And this is the lowest level of his values.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:39.000
There came things like, he called them values of life, but these were values of fidelity, magnanimity, generosity, bravery, and so forth,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
a lot of which seemed to have gone out of fashion.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And then above that came beauty, goodness, and truth, the spiritual or the geistic of Arthur,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000
and then at the top of the apex of the pyramid was the sacred.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000
And I think that structure has been incredibly helpful to me in seeing what we're getting wrong,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
because the value, the only really driving value of the left hemisphere is utility.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
It's evolved in order to serve utility for us.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And of course we need it because it's very useful.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:26.000
But we mustn't think that this answers our questions or this sort of level of value is going to give us the fulfillment that is promised to us by our culture,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:34.000
which is all about acquisition and greed and competition, typical values of the left hemisphere.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So when we come to talk about purpose and its relationship with meaning,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.000
what I would say is, first of all, to make the distinction which we've really made,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.000
but it's the distinction between Cass's finite games and infinite games.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Finite games have a purpose and when you've achieved it, the game is over.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Infinite games are things that have the value in being performed at all and therefore eternally have that value.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:13.000
We've got locked into the type of belief that everything is a finite game, which it very clearly can't be.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And the things that give us meaning, I think, are for very obvious reasons not specifiable as extras it goes.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
We should try and do this and make that and so on.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:38.000
There's a level at which we have to guide ourselves and think, well, we need to make a conscious effort to shift our values.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But in the end, these things are not going to be of that kind.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
They're going to be openness to an attractive force.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:54.000
And those attractive forces are many, but they can boil down in some ways to three incredibly important things that give meaning to life,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
each of which has been more or less trashed by our current civilization.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:13.000
The first is our relationship with society are being bound to one another in the sense of religio.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:24.000
The business of sharing one's life with people who share your values, whom you can trust, whom you can confide in, whom you can eat with, play with,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
and generally share a culture which may be based on a religion but has common rituals that we all understand.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:42.000
That is one thing and it is extremely difficult to find any such coherence in modern society for a host of reasons which most people will be able to fill in for themselves.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But we don't have that kind of cohesion anymore and we're increasingly isolated, partly by technology.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And we live lonely lives.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:01.000
The UCLA loneliness index has shut up in recent years and I think we mentioned loneliness already.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And it's one of the key things that people say when you ask them about their lives, they say, they're lonely.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Now, meaning can't come from any purpose in being with others and belonging in the social world and contributing to it in some sort of obvious extrinsic way.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You can't specify ahead of time what that value will be.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
You only know it in the experiencing of it.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
This is the problem, it's the swimming problem.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You can't have a manual that tells you how to swim.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You sit on the bank of the river reading.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Now I know how to swim.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
You have to get in the water.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000
The second is our relationship with the natural world in all its complexity and beauty.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000
So for most people until very recently, it was almost impossible for their lives not to be enmeshed with the surrounding natural world.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Only in the last perhaps 150 years also have we become isolated from nature.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And this is a really important divorce, a very, very important one.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
The divorce from one another is very important.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:22.000
The divorce from nature and the sense of it as an environment, which is a technical term for something that surrounds you, but not what you are born out of, which is what nature really means and what you return to.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And the third is the relationship to a realm of something beyond this.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Again, we've mentioned this, I believe, but it is the transcendent realm or the realm of the spiritual or the sacred.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:52.000
And this, to a lot of people now, they've been trained to think that this is a rather negligible issue, that it really is a kind of vestige of something that hangs over from a primitive time when people weren't properly educated and they invented superstitions to try and explain life.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And I mean, that is such a terrible, terrible diminution and tragedy of what it is, travesty of what it is I'm talking about, and it is a tragedy.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So those three things are what I believe fundamentally are most important for bringing meaning to our lives.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And I can't specify, obviously, what the meaning is, you know, what is the meaning of life, a question you cannot answer, although I believe it's 43.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
But that's what I would say about that.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And it relates to the hemispheres in this way, that the left hemisphere is designed only for acquisition and pleasure, getting stuff, having fun.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
It's more of an energetically driven than the right hemisphere.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's more associated with addiction than the right hemisphere.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And it's certainly more associated with getting a kick out of power and acquisition.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Whereas the right hemisphere is more able to open itself to the sacred and to these other higher values that I specify when we cap them now.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:07.000
So I think there is a very important thing there that we've guided by something that literally doesn't see what it is that's pulling us or should be pulling us forward.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:17.000
That sense of direction or purpose in life and the values that call us forward.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So I want to say something about this that I feel like is me restating how the hemispheric model ends up getting imbalanced, almost obligately gets imbalanced in a way that leads to the world situation we have and see if you agree with that.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And I'm very much curious to hear related thoughts.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
So you mentioned that the primary left hemisphere value is utility.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And you also mentioned the word power, which is very important for because then civilizations have a relationship with each other that we can use social Darwinism to describe where there's a selection process defined in war and defined in population growth and things like that.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Where if a civilization has a relation, has our relationship to each other, our relationship to nature and our relationship to the sacred, all maximizing utility, right?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:21.000
So we think of human resources, we think of natural resources and we think of religions as kind of narrative weapons to be able to coordinate.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Then the culture that has those utilitarian power oriented views in all those areas will win that war.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:50.000
It will basically see nature as a commodity, extract more from nature to grow its population, to increase its resource consumption per capita, to grow its technological base, to utilize humans, to use the, you know, Norbert Wieners, the human use of human beings in the development of cybernetic systems.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
That are then seen as inexorably in competition with each other.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So they're going to, so we have to kind of mentality.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And then there's either no sacred, there's just that which is good is that which doesn't lose, which is kind of, I think it's very interesting that game theory was developed by von Neumann at the same time we developed the bomb at the same time we developed AI.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And it was game theory and economics as kind of the height of the reductionist experiment saying based on a kind of is out distinction that you'll negate which I'm very interested in that says since philosophy of science is going to say what is and can't say what ought then our best basis for ought is that which doesn't lose in an assumed competitive

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.000
dynamic so game theory is the only thing guiding and I would argue that if your only ought is game theory.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And you have the ability for recursive technologies that turn into exponential technologies that are in an exploitative relationship with the environment which even the term environment or natural resources of crazy term.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And in arms races with each other that that civilization is self terminating.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:10.000
But it's also hard to it's easy to see how it won right how it emerged that way because any civilization that oriented itself that way a little bit more was going to grow its population.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:24.000
More was going to advance its tech was going to win wars and then other ones kind of had to do similarly so what the values or the sense of sacred or the connection to nature or each other that the Native Americans had before colonizers went there didn't matter that much if

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:35.000
weaponry and technology and whatever was not going to compete so the left hemisphere might be less intelligent in some very important ways because wisdom.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
I've never actually heard anyone give a good definition of wisdom that doesn't involve restraint.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:53.000
It always ends up involving restraint and binding in some ways and but the utility emphasis of the left hemisphere is very good at game theory.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And then it creates almost an obligate trajectory and then nobody wants climate change but nobody can stop it.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Nobody wants species extinction.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Nobody wants desertification but nobody can stop it the overall topological features defining our world.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Nobody wants but the game theoretic relationship between we can't price carbon properly because if the Chinese don't they'll economically be thus therefore we have to externalize the cost.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:28.000
That game theoretic relationship creates a topology that is actually driving us in a self terminating direction and nobody steering because there is no sacred.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:36.000
There is no we're very good at solving problems and not very good at defining is this the right problem to solve right is this the right goal to achieve.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That's actually why I was so drawn to your work is because that I wasn't thinking of it in terms of hemispheres but I was certainly thinking of it in terms of capacities and predispositions of mind.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:14:03.000
The nature of mind that oriented to parts was very good at Techna and was very oriented to power and the power Techna thing together was going to win over the other ones and then create this kind of obligate trajectory.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I would love to hear you respond to that.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Very little in what you said that I would disagree with at all.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
We're in a bind which is to nobody's benefit really.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Why we get these things wrong and we need to find a way out of this which involves restraint.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I loved what you said about that and in fact it's our lack of restraint that means that we're not wise.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
It's very unwise and there are two levels to that.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:50.000
There's restraint in general and self restraint and the idea of self restraint used to be intrinsic to the rise of most civilizations.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:01.000
They were founded on a generation or several generations that were prepared to make sacrifices on a personal level in order to achieve something greater.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:08.000
That has moved out of the picture because the value now is about our personal gain.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But sometimes if we can restrain ourselves from just pursuing personal gain we could produce an outcome which would be far more beneficial for all.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Of course this is very famously a difficult thing to achieve because some people defect from the program.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:32.000
We're in a situation where we need everyone ultimately to come around to a certain way if it's a survive.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Now how can we do that? Can we do it at all?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I don't know but I believe that if enough people are committed enough and model their lives on the shift in relations with society, with nature and with the divine.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:05.000
If they can reorientate their values and stop seeking fulfilment in a very simplistic and direct way which doesn't actually achieve its goal and worse is destructive.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Then we could produce an outcome that would be satisfactory. I don't know if we can achieve that.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:27.000
It sounds like we'd have to convince everybody. Really if we convinced probably about 3% of the world's influential people then we might be on to something.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:38.000
So I want to come back to why the world's influential people might be the psychologically least likely to be able to be convinced based on what it took to become influential.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I want to come back to that in a moment because you said maybe we only have to influence 3% but a moment before you said if we're practicing self-restraint then anyone defects.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And they don't restrain so they do the more short term power thing than they win and then they create a world that orients to that thing.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So defection, sociopathic narcissistic defection is pretty key to this thing.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I'm really curious to hear your thoughts, reflections on any of this but also specifically how do we, what are the criteria, what is the evolutionary niche for the sociopathic narcissistic property to be selected for

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:29.000
and how would we close that niche because promoting wisdom where it will always lose game theoretically is not that interesting.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:43.000
So there's something about the relationship of wisdom and power and I would even say wisdom has to bind, it's a master emissary thing and I know this is very uncomfortable as it should be but if the master doesn't bind the emissary then everything's broken.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And so that which is power seeking has to actually be bound which requires power by something that is not power seeking in the same way.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Which is why Daoism says the one who wants to lead everybody should run away from, the one who doesn't want to lead and everyone pushes into leadership maybe you can listen to.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:10.000
So curious to hear your thoughts on wisdom binding power, closing the evolutionary niche on power seeking, those types of things.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So much. Yeah, so the, I mean, I think the, I agree with, first of all, what you did was brilliant and I really appreciate it. I'm likely and I'm a very significant agreement with it.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:48.000
John Keeks made a distinction between goals and ideals and the word purpose equivocates between them. A goal is an end state that everything else is in the service to and it's the utilitarian where an ideal is not an ideal is something that is part of the grammar by which you interpret and make sense of yourself in your life.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I agree. And we even did that with the sacred that we took sort of transcendent imminent and then we made this world.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:05.000
This is the Nietzschean critique only had a utilitarian value for that that world. And then when we stop believing in the upper world, this world seems to have no value.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000
That whole framework, I think has to be rejected, which is not a rejection of the sacred. I just want to make that very, very clear.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And so why I'm, I'm, I'm sort of on that is because I think that this is part of the answer. You can break game theoretic circumstances in which, right.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:34.000
You get people to remember certain things. So you can get some very core ones, like you go in a situation where you take $20. Oh, sure.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:42.000
And the situation where you take $20, but here's two people, but I got to give that person 40. So they're 60 and they get 40 and you get 20. Will you take it?

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.000
And if you don't take it, nobody gets it. No, I won't take it. So people, there's a symbolic thing that they're oriented towards.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:58.000
And it's something like they, they want to, they want to belong to a world that is a just world and that is more important to them than their own individual immediate gain.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That's the first thing. So there's a symbolic aspect to, and Robert Nozick made a good point about this that we, we didn't put that into a lot of and for good reasons.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:22.000
We didn't put it into a lot of the game theoretic modeling because it messes up all that modeling in a lot of ways. And then that connects to we don't actually super value.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:36.000
This is the sociopath, right? We will, we will, we will significantly undermine subjective well being if we have a reasonable belief that we will get enhanced meaning in life.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:49.000
This is part of our evolutionary heritage as mammals, we're also primates, we're also sociocultural and the prototypical instance we do this is have a kid.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:21:05.000
When you have a kid, all of the measures of subjective well being go down. Your health goes down, your sleeping goes down, your finances go down, your social connections go down, your amount of sleep you're getting is going down, you're sick all the time, your partner doesn't like you anymore.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:20.000
And you're in a constant stress situation and you ask people, well, why are you doing this? Like, you couldn't pay most people. Well, why are you doing this? Well, because it's making my life more meaningful because they're connected to something again that has a reality beyond themselves.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Right. I'll use your term of value beyond themselves.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
He used another term, interestingly, which was sacrifice.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Yes.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Which has related etymology to sacred.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Of course.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And something you can't say that you know something is sacred if you aren't willing to sacrifice for it. So please continue.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And this, and this is another thing to remember that the arrow of relevance for us does not point to just how are things relevant to me.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Yes, we do have to feel connected to ourselves because if we don't, we're dissociated or agencies undermine. But as Ian said, we have to feel fundamental, not how I'm, how are you relevant to me, but how am I relevant to you?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:09.000
How am I relevant to us? And how are we relevant to the world? And yes, how is, are we and the world relevant to something that grounds that world?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:21.000
What Plato would call the good, right? And so I think that if we can get people to remember, this is what I would want to say. I don't, I don't even like the word remember.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:30.000
I want people to be able to fall in love with all of these dimensions of being again, because this is one of the, this was Spinoza's big insight, right?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:42.000
The way you overcome a powerful motivation is what another powerful motivation is. We can get people to fall in love again with being within, between and beyond.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:51.000
We can, we can, we can break the game theoretic. This is what Christianity did in the Roman Empire. Christianity went out and it didn't.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Unlike Stoicism that tried, I'm not saying we shouldn't try and get the government, but that tried, right? And it had some success too. But Christianity went and said, there's a new way for you to love yourself.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:15.000
You are not the non-person the Roman Empire says you are. Here is a new way, agape is a way in which you can love yourself. And it's not a hedonistic, egocentric power.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Here's how we can love each other. And here's how we can love God.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And it captured the world. And it captured a world that was one of the epitomies of a world driven by power, competition, the lust for glory.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:43.000
So we have historical examples of if you give people, if you can get them out of meaning starvation, so they're not in a scarcity mentality.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:51.000
When you're a scarcity mentality, you drop into left hemispheric. I think Ian's right about that. You're short term, utilitarian, right? What do I need?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Because this is emergency mode. But if you can get people out of a scarcity mentality and get them to fall in love with being again, connecting this to themselves and others, then you can get, you can call them to something that gets them to remember that they actually do value trying to use your language, right?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Connectedness more than success.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I really like the must fall in love with, I want to play with the scarcity thing for a minute, because the people that are pursuing power the most are not in any actual economic scarcity, though they are in the perceived relative scarcity relative to the next guy competing with them.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And there are plenty of people who under scarcity share more. I've always found fascinating that when there's a disaster, either the best or the worst of people can come out. And so scarcity can go either way and abundance can go either way.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:05.000
So there's something about what is sacred that is actually deeper than that even under scarcity can have someone sacrifice and that even under abundance can still have someone totally self centered.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Yes, but I did want when I was using scarcity that was talking about meaning scarcity. Yes, not economic distinction. And one of the things that happens.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:27.000
For example, as people go up, the, this is an experiment, as people go up a corporate structure, and the corporate structures tend to favor people who have sociopathic tendencies.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:40.000
What you also see is a measurable decrease in the ability of them to take the perspective of other individuals. Yeah, the ability to take the perspective of others individuals is strongly predictive of how many deep connections you can form in your life.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And they are actually suffering a very profound kind of scarcity as they go up there a bit there can, if you allow me to coin for their suffering connectedness scarcity in a profound way.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And, you know, what what what what I what I've been fascinated with is the number and I sure this is happening to both you, the number of people who are in these positions and positions of power, who have reached out to me and said,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:17.000
I feel disconnected and there's there's that element of almost a horror and absurdity. I feel disconnected and I want like, and I want to be and I don't want it and the people I talked to in Silicon Valley, I don't want my kids to go through this.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I don't want my kids to go. And this is what I mean, there is alternative motivations to, and I think they have also an evolutionary provenance to the game theoretic motivations and I don't think the game theoretic motivations are are metaphysically necessary.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I think there are other ones that have an equal power to motive and because we have historical evidence we have current evidence that we can tap into those.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:53.000
But I think there's two poles to this for us to fall in love with being again. That's that's the agent pole, but the world as an arena in which we cannot, it has to be sacred to us.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Sacred is sacred is the how the world is to us when we are falling in love with it.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I want to go into sacred. I want to say something about what you said. You said that as people move up in positions, as we look at places where power is concentrated and we move up the power hierarchy.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:20.000
It is there are exceptions to this, but it is generally the case that the people who are at the top of the power hierarchies are people who are both attracted to and good at power games.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:31.000
And there are certain other things that are attendant and deficient that tends to go along with that and power, whether it's economic, social or political, follows a power law distribution.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So one of the things I find very interesting is that I think there's a mistake that a lot of sociology makes where we look at certain human traits like rationality or empathy or whatever on a Gaussian distribution.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And then say humanity is the result of this where realistically the actual power influencing things says that a tiny percentage of people that are three standard deviations psychologically different than almost everyone have most of the determining power.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:05.000
And then they create conditioning environments that everyone else is conditioned by. I think that's really important. We, you know, hyperagency.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I have found that, like, we had a term psychopathy and then sociopathy and now it's ASD and the DSM, anti social personality disorder, that there are types of people there that have higher and lower ability to take others perspectives.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:34.000
And so there are people who have sociopathy or whatever you want to call it that have lower ability to take other people's perspectives, but there are ones that have higher cognitive empathy but lower embodied empathy.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And the higher cognitive empathy means I know how to play you and how to say what you want to hear in virtue signal.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And it's a very important point from a hemisphere point of view, because that cognitive empathy is more based on the left frontal cortex.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
It's the simulation of real empathy.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Yes, exactly.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And the real empathy or the emotive empathy is more based in the right hemisphere.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:12.000
But also we know that sociopaths have deficiencies in the right ventromedial frontal cortex, which is an area that's terribly important for forming any kind of emotional relationship with anybody else.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Whether this is a thing that they're born with or not is not finally concluded, but I think it pretty clearly is something that they are born with that it could be a result of a certain kind of deficient parenting.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:43.000
What we're coming back to there is that, again, there is this contrast between a connected world, a relational world in which the values come out of the relations, and another kind which is a linear world of target getting, goal getting,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:49.000
in which we think that what is valuable will come out of completing that goal.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And it doesn't.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.000
I want to pick up on what you said, because I think that distinction is very important that you made.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And here, there's an ambiguity in taking a perspective. You can take a perspective in that calculative way, you said.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:17.000
That's different from taking off a perspective in which you care and you try to see the world from that perspective.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:26.000
This is the danger in teaching people to perspective take like the way rhetoric can do it, because you can create a very good lawyerly person.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
What I've found is that people who are best at perspective seeking are either empaths or sociopaths.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
They're good at perspective seeking because they really feel what other people feel and they're seeking to, or because they actually don't have any binding to anything real.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
They can take whatever perspective happens of utility without caring about its relationship.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
And that's the thing one has to really watch out for, is the simulation of empathy.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
And it brings up something. So you were talking about Christianity binding game theory.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I'm not a Christian scholar, so I'm just going to, from the outside say, the fact that in the name of Jesus Christ who said,

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:08.000
let he who has no sins cast the first stone, we were able to do the Inquisitions is a really interesting act of mental gymnastics.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And so I see that wherever there is a relationship to the sacred that is authentic, and it starts to develop the ability to really move people,

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:25.000
there's power in that, then those who are seeking power seek to capture it, and corrupt it.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:31.000
And so then all the religions become these mixed bags of an authentic beautiful thing, and the way power ends up capturing them.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:37.000
And if they don't orient to power, then they usually lose in a holy war, their population doesn't become very big or something like that.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I would love to hear, because there's, how do we have a proliferation of the sacred for which someone will make real sacrifices,

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and for which whole populations will, that doesn't lose to other populations that don't do that, and that doesn't get captured by power and perverted and distorted?

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Right. Okay. So first of all, agreed.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
But I want to, I want to, I want to say,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Well, the notion of restraint.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Christianity was successful in pretty much keeping it as part of the cultural cognitive grammar that people other than the male citizens were actually persons.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It was successful at turning infanticide into an accepted practice into something we find horrific.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000
So, yes, I'm not saying that, you know, the power structures came in.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:51.000
But there were, there was also enough, I mean, we, we are running on the fumes of the Christian sacred canopy, and it's been what has been still keeping some restraints on this otherwise Milwaukee and machine that's running.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000
And I want to, what I'm trying to say is,

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:06.000
I want to, I want to, I want to give us a sense of hope about this, that it's not the sacred emerges, and then it gets consumed.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:14.000
The sacred emerges, there is the, there is the pushback, there's the reframing, there's the power consumption.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
But some of the underlying cultural cognitive grammar has been fundamentally changed.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
We haven't gone back to the Bronze Age.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
We're still post-Axio, we haven't gone back to the pre-Christian age.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
We're, right, that that's not what happened.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:34.000
And so I'm saying, I'm not denying that, right, I'm not denying that there's the threat.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Well, what I'm saying is, but if we could be more clear about what gets preserved across the, I don't know what they're calling the re-entrenchment of the power dynamics, and could we better, more better this time, focus our attention there,

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:00.000
focus our cultural and even our political commitments, we could perhaps do it better this time.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I mean, I think we must, this exactly brings up a question I wanted to ask you is, in the parable that you told of the master and the emissary, I might argue that the responsibility for the failure of that civilization or tribe,

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
or whatever you want to call it, was the masters, not the emissaries.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Because the master obviously misassessed.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
The master would probably have agreed with you.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Yes.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And so, rather than say the master was wise and the emissary wasn't, so he did a Dunning-Kruger thing and messed it all up, the master was missing a certain kind of wisdom in his assessment of the actual realistic capabilities of the emissary.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:44.000
There was some stuff in his noticing the whole that he wasn't noticing that was really critical for him to ultimately still hold responsibility.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So there's an uptick in the master capability that could have kept that relationship right.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Yes.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:00.000
So there's something about needing to be power literate, to be able to keep power from corrupting a relationship with the sacred.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:14.000
I mean, rather than say that the master was deficient in some way, one would say that there was an important relationship here which required a certain degree of vulnerability.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:26.000
So the master couldn't remain invulnerable because he realized that he needed to not concern himself with certain things, if things were to survive.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000
So there isn't a squeaky clean answer to this.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
He had in a way to trust.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:41.000
In some ways it's very like the story of God and Satan, that Satan was Lucifer, the lightbringer, the brightest of the angels, God's right hand.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:48.000
And because of his power hungriness and his envy of God, everything fell to ruin.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000
But at the end of that story isn't ruined because Christianity, again, I'm becoming more and more convinced during our conversation.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:05.000
If nothing else comes out of it, how very, very important the sort of overarching effect of a religion such as Christianity is for the survival of a civilization.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I mean, I've always felt that, but I see it more and more in what we're talking about.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And what you've adverted to earlier was the necessary sort of supervision.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And that is a difficult balancing act as it is for the master and the emissary.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And there's another fable which I tell at the beginning of part three of the math of it things, which is an Onondaga legend.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:45.000
And they have the story of how, you know, because creation was waning, there were these two brothers who were sent to sort of regenerate the power of the universe.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And these brothers are not equal, like the master and the emissary.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
One of them is wise and he is called the one that holds the earth with both hands.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
The other is called hard as ice, the flint.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And his value is that he's got a tool that his father gave him, which is speech.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
And the other is an arrow with which he can shoot.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And this is an extraordinary, just starting there, division between, as it were, the writer has left out a bit.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000
But the story gets better and better as it goes on.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:29.000
I can't tell the whole thing, but those are interested in recording on YouTube of me reading the introduction of this chapter in which we tell the story.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But effectively what the good brother realizes is the bad brother tries to imitate the good brother, because he's envious of him.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
He sees the good brother creating all kinds of wonderful things, birds and beasts and flowers.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And he tries to create and he produces only thorns and flies and bats.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.000
And there's a sort of sense that he is dangerous left to himself.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:04.000
But he must also not come too close to the good brother, because the good brother needs to preserve a degree of his independence without which he is no longer himself.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So they can't fuse, but one needs to be subservient to the other, the one needs to have power over the other.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:14.000
But that is not something that can ever be secured 100%.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Right.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
So you could never have the situation where the one that is wise has that power,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
because one of the terms on which wisdom exists is that it sees beyond power.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Now, I know that you've made a very good point that there needs to be a certain degree of sort of watchfulness and awareness.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I agree about that.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000
But quite how this is managed in a way that doesn't actually appreciate the whole business of wisdom,

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:48.000
because in most cultures wisdom is associated with, well, in Chinese with Wu Wei, within action.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000
The master does nothing, but nothing is left undone.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.000
These remarkable and beautiful sayings of the Taoist literature.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So we have to somehow find a way of making that work.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:07.000
And I don't know what your ideas about how that could be made to work are.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.000
A close friend and colleague of mine that you both know, Zach Stein,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:23.000
talks about the distinction between power differentials in educational setting versus in most traditional power settings.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Specifically, he's talking about educative authority versus propaganda in terms of information asymmetries.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And that the key distinction, and this gets fuzzy, but the key distinction is that someone who has information asymmetry relative to someone else

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000
who could use that asymmetry to maintain the asymmetry and grow it, which is the impulse of power traditionally.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:51.000
In the educative example, the educator recognizes that they have an information asymmetry,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:58.000
but they're in a kind of fiduciary relationship where their goal is to actually bring the student up to symmetry with them and even beyond.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So their goal is not to maintain their power asymmetry.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:05.000
They use the power asymmetry to close it.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And whereas in most power dynamics, if someone has an economic asymmetry, they use that increased economic power, political power to both maintain it and grow it.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:21.000
And so we would say the first one is an ethically legitimate utilization of the reality of a power differential.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
The second one is not a legitimate one.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:35.000
But what that also means is let's say that the educator who's trying to bring this person up to competence recognizes that there's someone else who's trying to exploit them.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:43.000
The educator now has some ethical responsibility in their fiduciary responsibility to the student to also do something over here, to do something in that relationship.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And that is where I think it's very interesting is if those who are pursuing the true, the good and the beautiful,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:01.000
those who are pursuing a deep relationship with the sacred and wisdom don't do anything,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:09.000
and don't develop any levers of technological or economic or other types of power, low deceiving, so to speak,

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:17.000
then they're leading the direction of the world to those who maximally seek power orientation for the illegitimate use.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And so then you have to say, is it really wise to say I seed power of the world to the sociopaths,

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
including in the risk of eminent extinction and the destruction of the sacred and not just the future destruction,

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
but that 10 to 20 animals go extinct every day from human action,

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:41.000
that there are two orders of magnitude, more mammals and factory farms and in the wild today.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000
There's some ethical obligation of those who give a shit about that to have that give a shit do something, to be actual, as you say,

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:55.000
actual meaning that it acts. So are our values actual? If they're actual, do they have a causal effect?

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Yeah. Well, are they obligated to?

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I mean, if I may just respond to that. I'm not suggesting that we just sit back and roll over and let everything go to hell in a hand cut.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:19.000
That's very far from what I'm saying. But what I'm saying is that even if we were to find ways of reducing certain kinds of harm,

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:27.000
unless they were accompanied by a growth in wisdom, that really wouldn't achieve what we need to achieve.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.000
We would leave the psychopaths in charge, actually. So it is a difficult one.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I mean, your analogy is not meant to be perfect, but for example, with the teacher bringing the pupil up to his standard and maybe beyond,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:50.000
which I like that idea, and I think it's a real one. But if the student is, in fact, basically psychopathic,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:59.000
then has he done good by doing that? I mean, once you start looking at the outcomes of actions rather than the motivations behind actions,

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
you get famously into trouble.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:14.000
There's three things I want to respond to. One is I'm hearing, we've been talking a lot about the master versus the emissary,

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000
but it seems to me that we're in a weird problematic here. And I know this isn't an accurate representation of your thought,

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
but I want to pose it. But I want to also state all three things because they belong together.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:33.000
One is, yeah, but that also requires that the left hemisphere has some reverence for the right hemisphere,

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:41.000
but reverence is probably a property of the right hemisphere. And so you've got this weird catch-22 thing going on.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And then I think part of how we have done this, and this is why I'm bringing up the educator, is important, is we've done this by saying,

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.000
there's another variable in here, which is there's not only individual cognition, there's the collective intelligence of distributed cognition.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:09.000
There's something that comes out in a week, like what's here, that doesn't belong to you or to me, but it takes on a life of its own.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And of course, this is the whole tradition of the Ecclesia and the tradition of the geist and the tradition of the logos.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And the Socratic Dialogue, we follow the logos wherever it goes. And what that does is, this is Plato's pivot problem.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Because the example you're talking about is exactly the problem that Plato was wrestling with with Socrates and Elcibiades.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Here you have the most attractive, not physically, but the most attractive representation of wisdom.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:49.000
And here you have this, you know, glorious figure who is attracted to Socrates, but is ultimately, properly, you know, a psychopath, Elcibiades,

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:59.000
is willing to screw anybody over for his own personal work and betray everybody. And Plato really is vexed about how, why doesn't he turn?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:06.000
What makes somebody pivot towards that? And then Plato wrestles with this and he has sort of two answers.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:22.000
One is, there's a sort of seduction, and I hate to use that term in our charged atmosphere, but there's a seduction, which is, you basically get sort of the left hemisphere really involved with the kind of stuff it likes to do,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:33.000
running arguments and discussions. But as it's doing that, you use that as a way of getting it to pay attention to the non propositional, right, in very, very powerful ways.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And this is why Plato writes dialogues, because the drama and the character development are as important as the argument. We did a great disservice that we just took the arguments out and stuck them over.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:52.000
All right. But if you do that, that's that that that's part of the answer. And then in that, what what part of the seduction is.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000
And it's not, like, if you try to make somebody follow the sacred, it's not sacred. Right.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:19.000
The seduction is like, again, how, how we fall in love, right, is if you put people into these circumstances where they can catch the fire of the logos, then they will often feel called to reorient themselves.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:30.000
They will do the Plato's pivot. It's not an algorithm, because it was an algorithm, it wouldn't be the thing we need. We can't make it an algorithm and we're looking for something algorithmic where we're fundamentally

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:43.000
misapprehending the ontology that has to be at its basis. But I've seen this when we do these dialogical practices, people say, and this is regardless of where they come from, religious or secular, they're saying,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:56.000
this is a kind of intimacy I've always been looking for, but I didn't realize it sounds like platonic and amnesis, right. And then and then if they go longer, right, they start to they start to move beyond the intimacy between they say,

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:12.000
there's the we space or the guys or the logos and they start to feel intimate with and then they're called to that. And then some people are called beyond that they're called to through all of that I get a sense of intimacy with being itself and they get the possibility of falling in love again.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:30.000
But I can't argue them. I can put them into a place where there's orientation going on, where there's conceptual reflection going on. But this thing, we have to structure it with a lot of finesse, so it takes on a life of its own, and can draw us in so we can get people to do the platonic pivot.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:39.000
That's, that's how I would address what logic has this compulsory kind of nature, if you like that it's trying to compel a position.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Yes. And what you rightly are pointing out is that the things that really matter like wisdom and love can't be compelled in this way.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:54.000
No. And if they are there, no longer wisdom or love. There was always a vulnerability involved here. That's terribly important in my view.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:07.000
And it's not necessarily anybody's fault if that vulnerability leads as it usually does eventually to some kind of a downfall. But without actually taking the risk, we can't have the great things that we have had.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So it has its own value and purpose, even if we can't actually always guarantee what kind of an outcome there's going to be.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Okay, but I want to pick up on the seduction. I agree with what you're saying. But what I want to say is, can we get, I'm trying to use your language because I want to play with you.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Can we get the left hemisphere involved with speech and logic, and it likes to play this. This is what happens. But it gets drawn, it gets drawn into something that is beyond itself.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:50.000
It does. And that takes me back to a point you made early on that how can it ever be that the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere have that right relationship because the left hemisphere has this intrinsic loss of reverence or whatever.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:49:00.000
But I don't think that's necessarily the case because I think the problem comes when we give too much power to the emissary in that myth.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So to begin with in civilisation, the left hemisphere and right hemisphere work very well together. The left hemisphere is given exactly that kind of a job that it's good at.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.000
And if you like to put it this way, I'm being ridiculous at the anthropomorphic, but it's happy to be in that role and to contribute.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:28.000
But the problem comes when we start to lose, I'm going to come back to this thing about the value difference between the right and left.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.000
I think it's absolutely essential to the situation we're in. It's our complete loss of orientation towards the right values.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And what happens then is that the values of the left hemisphere are encouraged and the left hemisphere starts to see only its own point of view and it thinks itself in a Dunning-Kruger-like way to be more intelligent than it is.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Okay, and I agree with this wholeheartedly, but I want to say something that overlaps with Daniel, what he's saying.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Because one of the things that the Enlightenment, why it takes off, I would argue, is it gets a way of really clarifying the difference between authority and power.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:17.000
And this is one of the things, you know, so you've got Kant, and then I want to correct it with Hegel, but Kant is basically saying, I know,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:28.000
authority is when I recognize you as being able to say something that I will fundamentally be persuaded of as true.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.000
So I recognize that you are, you know, this is a Kantian model, his language is dangerous, but just let me use it for now.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:44.000
I recognize you as a rational being, and therefore I should acknowledge that what you say, I should take it seriously and allow it to possibly persuade me.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And then when I do something because you have persuaded me, I do it because I have recognized you and you have recognized me.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:03.000
And then Hegel said, oh, but this reciprocal recognition, which is what you get in the student and the teacher that you don't get in, because the master sleigh, this is Hegel,

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
you don't have reciprocal recognition, right?

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
And importantly, that is not the relationship between the hemispheres I talk about that.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Exactly, exactly. And this is exactly so one of the things I think the one of the things why the Enlightenment takes office because it brought this tremendous liberating clarification about wait, wait, wait.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:37.000
We want, we want, we want all the governance, even myself governance to be based on authority, which is based on reciprocal recognition and Hegel says not only moment to moment, but all of the people before you, and all the people that are going to come after you,

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:48.000
the biggest possible distributed cognition machine you have, you want, you want to be like listening to them and you want to be trying to get the future to listen to you and you get this tremendous model of authority.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:52:04.000
And I think that was tremendously liberating. Now, the, the, and then what I see happening is that some of the things that came along with that is how the, the right hemisphere started to seed power or not realize that power is getting seeded.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Because once you give, right, this, this priority to this, right, then you start to give a, it's very easy to get into the idea, oh, but all the, all that the reasoning is all of the, all that the rationality is it's not a way of being, it's just a way of calculating

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Hobbes proposes this, right. So, right, the enlightenment gives us something that is tremendously of value and I don't, I don't think we want to go back to and give that back again. We don't want to go back to master slide.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And so we have to get to that, that, that point where no, no, no reason isn't about calculation, it's about being with each other in a way that we are reciprocally responsible to each other.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
So we are governed by authority rather than by power.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:18.000
That's, I'm trying to answer you that that is, that is possible for us. There was two things in the enlightenment that got inappropriately bound together. I think the very legitimate understanding of the difference between authority and power, and then the illegitimate reduction of rationality, not as a way of being with each other, but as a way of calculating each other's behavior.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Which is, in my terms, the handing over of reason to mere rationality, rationality being schematic logic as a way of understanding things, whereas the reason is a way of balancing rationality with the intuitions that come from a life where we live from experience.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And that is what is reason. It was always thought to be the main purpose of an education for 2000 years in the West to produce a reasonable person.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yes.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
And that's what one would expect of a wise judge or a good politician, but we don't have that.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Right. So my language for that, and I don't think it's in any way different. I talk about the ancient notion of logos and with Descartes, you get it reduced to logic.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:20.000
And then we reduce reason to just logical manipulation of propositions. And we lose all the other. We lose the perspectival and the participatory notions.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:30.000
So you said something at the beginning I want to come back to, which is how can the left brain have reverence for the right if it doesn't have reverence as a capability?

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Yes.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And I think this is something I said to Ian when he and I had a brief visit yesterday is what Gertl did with the incompleteness theorem was use math to show the upper boundaries of math.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Sure.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.000
But that's the Socratic project. That's what Socrates does, almost all of the dialogues end in a poria, for that reason.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And it's what the Guyanayog path and the Vedic tradition did.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Exactly, of Poans in Zen.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:08.000
It's what Tarski did with formal logic, using formal logic to show the upper bounds. And I think it's exactly what Ian is doing in describing the master emissary relationship in a way the left brain can understand.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Because, you know, I was saying earlier, wouldn't the master be the more responsible party? I think they're both responsible, right? And so there is a reverence the left hemisphere has to have for the right.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:26.000
There is a recognition of the developmental maturity capacity and relationship with the environment the right needs to have, right?

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And we're of course using left and right hemisphere than the individual to also represent forces in the world, distribution of people and like that.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And I think the very best thing that the parts based, one of the best things the parts based mind can do is recognize its own upper boundaries being insufficient to what is actually worth caring about.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.000
In which case, it has its own kind of transcendence, right? It has its own recognition of something beyond itself worth listening to.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:11.000
So, again, evolutionary provenance for this, right? I think one way I would say of Ian's histiography is like the what should be properly opponent processing and I'll explain what I mean by that has become adversarial processing.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:27.000
And this is also the problem at the level of our distributed cognition. If you look throughout our biology, you have opponent processing going on opponent processing is when you have two systems that have complimentary biases, and then you lock them together so that each is the best

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:38.000
the best corrector of the other. So, non controversial example is the autonomic nervous system. You have the sympathetic system biased in one way that views everything as a threat and opportunity.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:49.000
The parasympathetic is everything is right. And they're like this. And so your level of arousal is constantly evolving and there's doesn't have to be any king or emperor over this, because it is a self correcting system.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Your attentional system, the task focused default, you're constantly moving between focusing your attention and varying opponent processing opponent processing between foregrounding and backgrounding and I can go on and on.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Why does nature keep coming to this because it is how you solve the no free lunch there every heuristic has a complimentary bias. This is a mathematical theorem or proof.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:26.000
But, and this is one of the things I put in my original 2012 paper, but if you put two complimentary heuristics together, they can toggle between each other, and you don't fall prey to the no free lunch.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:41.000
You can escape the trap that you have to constantly fall into the bias from your heuristic nature figured this out. And I think I would put it to you if we understand it the way I've explained it to you that the proper relationship between the

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:58.000
left hemisphere could be opponent processing, rather than adversarial processing, if each hemisphere could come to see the other hemisphere as a valuable source of self correction, because as you say they solve different sets of problems well defined

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:08.000
problems left hemisphere, very ill defined gestaltish problems in the right hemisphere. And but this is also something not at the individual level democracy history.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Democracy requires this commitment, which is not game theory, but it is has evolutionary provenance, you are the best possible entity for me overcoming my self deceptive bias because you have alternative biases, and I am the best for you.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:38.000
And if we both commit to the guys the logos between us, we can get the best self correcting system, which is what democracy is supposed to be but not just for individual cognition, it's supposed to be for cognition, distributed cognition.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:50.000
But again, I'm trying to offer you the theme you have that I keep wanting to answer is there's evolutionary providence for the alternatives that are being discussed here that can be tapped into.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Yes, I want to propose something in relationship to this in here, both your thoughts. One very simple way I would sometimes describe the generator of the metacrisis is that humans have radically beyond evolutionary capability via technology development and still using relatively close to evolutionary motivations.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:32.000
That you can't apply apex predator theory to sapiens and have a biosphere that doesn't self destruct, because a polar bear can't make nukes, and an orca can't kill all the fish in the ocean, but we can do both.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:48.000
And so we're obviously not an apex predator, we're, we obviously are something well beyond that, because the evolutionary process, having most of the adaptive capacity and the other animals be corporeal and very slow evolving and slow evolving through processes that create co selection.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Creates a symmetry of power, whereas the orca gets faster sort of the tune and they get away and as the polar bear gets faster, the walruses get bigger and all that kind of thing.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:13.000
And with the complexification of our cognitive processes that could start to do technique and I would say, I'm just going to call it technique in general, both physical technologies and language, capitalism, etc.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:25.000
That our adaptive capacity and our predate of capacity increased rapidly faster than any of the rest of the environment, increased its resilience or relative capacity.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And so I would put the origin of the metacrisis not with evolutionary processes, but with the beginning of stone tools, right.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And it's stone tools were pretty slow evolutionary curve.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
And so then with the agricultural revolution, we got a big bump.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:53.000
And then the industrial we get a big bump. I think we get a big bump in the upper pillar of the transition and that's my response to, which is we get a big bump in the upper pillar of the transition in which we seem to get the advent of the appreciation of the sacred that goes along.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:01:07.000
It is so into some of our biggest cognitive, cognitive advancements. So you have the technology like you said is like this, right. And then we get this bump, and we get projectile weapons, we get calendars.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:14.000
We get, but we also get music. We also get representational art. We've seen it.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Here, here's my argument actually it's a you're, you're making it.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Okay, humans have been a very mixed bag in from a ethical perspective of the only creature that really scientifically optimized tortured of the most subjective suffering possible, but also the only one that will sacrifice itself for other species and that can make the

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:47.000
value of the Bodhisattva, right. Our abstraction allowed us to search a very wide search space. So the most kind of beautiful, numerous stuff and the most kind of horrific stuff.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:57.000
What I'm arguing is that that mixed bag that we have been with exponential tech near planetary boundaries self terminates, and that we don't get to keep being that mixed bag.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And this now comes up to the vulnerability of if the relationship to the sacred is forced or compulsory, it's not actually a relationship to the sacred. If you remove choice, it's not ethics anymore, it's mechanism.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
And so there's a vulnerability in the recognition of actual choice and in the honoring of choice.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:24.000
But we have to do that and fundamentally differently than we've ever done because if you say how well have we stewarded our power historically.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:36.000
If you ask the other species that we inhabited the planet with or the lower classes within civilizations or whatever, that mixed bag stewarded it pretty poorly in many places.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:51.000
But we couldn't split atoms, and we couldn't change genomes and we couldn't make AI. So the question comes. And so let's take AI for a moment because splitting atoms takes

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:04.000
G8 nation state level capacity to do it actually does and the G8 has made sure nobody else gets to use it through the AI and making sure that if anyone even tries to bomb them preemptively because we don't want the power to get distributed.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:14.000
And yet we're distributing the power of synthetic bio and AI rapidly that is every bit is destructive to not just other state actors but anybody in a way that is unmonitorable.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:31.000
So when you have decentralized catastrophe weapons and things that can create the catastrophe even by the intentionally good use but with mistaken externalities from doing too much narrow problem solving and not enough is this a good goal is this the right problem orientation.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:37.000
And anybody does the AI weapon everybody has to do the AI weapon or they lose by default those types of dynamics.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:52.000
And I would argue that that our abstraction capacity exploring that whole search base, the power sides of it end up and you know, Robert writes non zero.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Of course you have in you have a selection for increased coordination within an in group that can do sometimes coordination with an out group that we call trade but sometimes zero some more negative some competition within out group.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And there's a shelling game where I'll coordinate with you when it's in my benefit while reserving the right to defect on you and that's in our benefit and if anybody does that then everybody's in that kind of game theory.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:22.000
And if someone says well we'll just sacrifice ourselves comprehensively great and there's just no more of those people those people are gone and the people who made it through the people who won the game theory thing.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:35.000
What I'm saying is that both through conflict theory people who want to do messed up stuff with this much technological power and through mistake theory people who are just, I don't want to cause climate change but I want to do stuff that requires energy,

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.000
multiplied by the content imperative of there's a billion people all wanting to do the same thing.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:50.000
We go extinct in all those scenarios or we at least radically lose civilization any definition of civilizational progress anybody could want to argue I would already say when you talk about the enlightenment.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:01.000
If you ask how was the enlightenment and how was civilizational how is generally the narrative of civilizational progress to the Native Americans, or to any of the indigenous species that works, you know, indigenous people that were

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.000
extinct or any of the other species or whatever the progress narrative is a very challenging narrative.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
And I'm not going to throw out all of the baby with the bathwater but we have to hold the complexity of it.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:28.000
The question that I'm really curious about is, given the amount of technological power that we have and that we're rapidly getting, and given how much that power has already eroded the biosphere to the point of tipping points,

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:35.000
and given how distributed all the people are and there is no one king of the world I'm not saying we would want it, who can make choices.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Can we imagine a humanity that has the wisdom to steward that power, reasonably well.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Well, here's my here's my challenge back to you, because you've made this argument before and I find it compelling but I also find it frustrating, because the argument is set up.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:08.000
It basically says, we have no examples from the past that we can rely on, and then asked us to imagine the future, where, how can we possibly imagine the future without relying on the past examples.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
It's a request to do, and I know you're not trying to do that.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:29.000
I would argue that we have examples from the past temporarily that were able to use restraint via wisdom, via relationship to the sacred, adequate to have their own population and some relative sustainability with its environment and some reasonable quality of life producing.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:42.000
I have indigenous scholar friends who've said that the early indigenous wisdom traditions, we're talking 40,000 years ago, actually emerged in relationship with human extinction of megafauna.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:50.000
And that they had already messed up and were like, whoa, we're too powerful to be this dumb, we have to be a lot wiser, men are not the web of life, we're a strand within it, whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves,

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:55.000
that the first wisdom traditions were already their response to the anthropogenic crisis.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:07.000
And so then they might have had a while of relatively good binding of that level of tech, then someone else got a higher level of tech, didn't have the same binding, and then those people got wiped out or had to join the thing.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.000
So I'm not saying we have no precedent of people doing a wisdom binding power thing.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:19.000
I'm saying we have no adequate precedent to the current situation, because obviously we have a totally different power dynamic.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:25.000
But it's okay to say that new stuff is required, right?

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
So this is an innovative question.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:34.000
It's an innovating in the domain of wisdom question that, of course, draws on but is not limited to what we have done so far.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000
So to my ear, this just sounds like an exactive proposal.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Can we take stuff totally that's been working one way and repurpose it?

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Like the way the tongue has been repurposed for speech.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Am I understanding you correctly?

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Because sometimes I've heard...

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.000
It has to be exactive.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Right, okay.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.000
So it is...

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:55.000
I don't think we were evolutionarily selected to wisely steward AI.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
No, I don't think anyone would argue that.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:02.000
So we were evolutionarily selected to have hemispheres that do this stuff, and it created...

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000
In the same way, I don't think we were evolutionarily selected to cause the Anthropocene and all of the problems and cause climate change.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Right.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:13.000
So I think the problems and the solutions are both exactive to the evolutionary capacities.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Right, okay.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Excellent.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
Okay.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:31.000
So the question is, how much hope can be placed in the sapiential, the wise oriented acceptations, compared to, like, let's call them the power dynamic acceptations, the technological power dynamic acceptations.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And it's difficult to know where we...

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I'm not trying to be difficult.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I'm just trying to say, for me, it's like, where would we stand to ask that question?

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Like what would be the place in which you see us being able to...

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Like where are we standing such that we can look at these two and say, I can make sort of...

02:08:51.000 --> 02:09:00.000
I don't want to say objective, but a relatively neutral evaluation of these two and say, here's how we can place hope here.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Because you're not just asking people to place hope.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I hear you saying, can you give me good reason to place hope?

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Is that fair?

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I think...

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:23.000
So, you know, my process coming to this with regard to global catastrophic risk obviously involved recognizing none of the other species were causing global catastrophic risk and people with stone tools couldn't cause global catastrophic risk and people with bronze tools couldn't.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:33.000
So it was a relationship to human mind, our mind's ability to create vast economic, industrial communication, educational governments, technological systems.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:44.000
The way those systems in turn reinforce patterns of mind, they lead us to a novel situation of self-induced global catastrophic risk that is increasingly eminent.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:55.000
And then saying, what do all these different risks have in common in terms of the patterns of human experience and behavior, individually and collectively, particularly collectively, that give rise to them?

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Because if we can identify those generative dynamics, then we can say a future that is not described by these catastrophes has to deal with these generative dynamics.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:15.000
And so we talk about the third attractor of like neither a future defined by increasing catastrophe nor a control response to that that gives dystopias what's left.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:25.000
And so really it's a what are the necessary criteria of a civilization that could steward the amount of technological power we have well.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:33.000
So then this is great. This is helpful. I think Ian and I have been trying to point out what some of those underlying generative dynamics are.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Exactly.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And I don't mean to put words in your mouth. So if I say something inappropriate, please intervene.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:58.000
But proposed, you know, these ideas of wisdom, correct interest, cerebral, intra psychic relation, correct distributed cognition, replacing adversarial with opponent, bringing back love of virtue, love of the transcendentals,

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:08.000
just every fairy, they have an evolutionary provenance so we can depend on deep motivations to empower them. But I sense that you're still sensing an inadequacy in this.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Well, I think at an individual level, these are good thoughts.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Right.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:25.000
At the, how do you have those define the way AI is developed and rolled out and the way synthetic biology is developed and rolled out and the way that NATO and Russia engage over Ukraine is different.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:40.000
So one is saying, what would more why, like, is there a basis? There's a philosophical questions. Is there a basis in reality for intrinsic purpose or meaningfulness or sacred?

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Is there, are there different capacities, maybe hemispheric orientations within humans to understand that better?

02:11:49.000 --> 02:12:00.000
IE, are there ways of developing wisdom that could steward power better? That's like the philosophic and then developmental at the individual level.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:12.000
But then it's the, you pointed out the word defection earlier, right, which is the defection from the wisdom that is directing the power that can end up leading to these kind of slippery things.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:20.000
You can never totally close that. But in the time of stone tools or bronze tools, the worst thing it could do was way less bad than the worst thing it can do now.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:38.000
So I'm asking for better thoughts on what would it take to develop wisdom at the scale necessary to actually have a human, a continuing human presence on the planet that doesn't destroy itself or totally suck.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:57.000
I've offered an answer to that, I thought. Okay. But my proposal is we need to basically co-opt and exact the machinery of religion because religions have been able to do, they've shown that they are proper distributed

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:07.000
indigenous and collective intelligent machines that can fundamentally reorient at a civilizational level. They can do that for good or for ill.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:20.000
And that what we need is something like that, and I'm not proposing that I'm going to start a religion because that's a ridiculous proposal, but I'm saying we have done this in the past.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Yeah. And of course, nobody makes a religion. There's an algorithm. There's a way in which I'm sort of high to Gary about that. The sacred has to somehow break through the way the complicated has failed in the face of the complexity of reality, and speaks in a new way, and something is called to that.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:51.000
And then we have something like, but it can't be like the axial religions. It has to be as different to the axial religions as the axial religions were to the Bronze Age religions. This is the proposal I'm making.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Okay, great. So this relates to what Ian said a few moments ago when he said, if I'm getting anything out of this conversation, it's how powerful something like Christianity must be.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:21.000
So you were speaking to this hierarchy of values and the utility values at the bottom, which obviously is not how the world is oriented currently, and some sense of the sacred at the top.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:35.000
We mentioned wisdom being something that has a concept of restraint bound so that utility is not always maximized, that power is not always maximized in service of something that is other than utility.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Absolutely.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:46.000
You're proposing that religion has served this function before, and that something like that is probably needed.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:59.000
What, obviously, we know the history of why church and state have been separated. We know all of the critiques of religion that are worthwhile.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:17.000
What do we imagine the relationship to some sense of sacred that is developable, that creates something like wisdom, that creates something like restraint and power binding, that creates something like increased felt meaningfulness,

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:24.000
increased sense of coordination that is other than game theory.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:45.000
What might that look like, because it probably won't be just religion as its own domain, it'll probably be how it relates to the educational system, and to media, and even how it's encoded in economics, and what are some of your thoughts on what the criteria of such religion might need to be,

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:54.000
and what it might look like, and what the transition from here to there or its development might look like.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:07.000
So I really want to be really clear that I am not proposing the founding of a religion or anything ridiculous like this, because relevance is not subjective.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:20.000
It has to be co-created by reality, and thus, religion has to be co-created by reality. There's a sense in which reality has to disclose something to us, so I just want to reiterate that contextualization.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Now within that, what I've been trying to do are two related projects.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:41.000
One is to try and look for what can be exacted from the past, and I want to use that language very carefully, and see some of the central things that come out of that.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:47.000
These are both very long arguments, so it'll be very compressed.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:58.000
One is, you take a look at what becomes pretty much the spiritual backbone of the West, and Arthur V. Lewis I think has argued this very well, which is something like Neoplatonism.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Neoplatonism has this tremendous capacity to enter into reciprocal reconstruction with Judaism, with Christianity, with Islam, with science. It does this at the beginning of the science.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So it has this tremendous thing, and I think Filler, in his wonderful book, in his series of essays, has made a very clear case, a very good case, that what Neoplatonism is trying to get us to do is give up a substance-based ontology.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:51.000
And I mean substance, not just in the Cartesian sense, but the Aristotelian sense, that we think of the world. The most real things are spatio-temporal physical things to which properties bind, and that relations emerge out of these things.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:06.000
And that what Neoplatonism is trying to say is, no, reality is ultimately about intelligibility, or we can use something analogous from our modern thinking. We have to play with it, though, information, and this is inherently relational.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Intelligibility, information are inherently relational, and so reality is fundamentally, primarily relational, but it takes a lot of transformation of individuals for to get them into seeing the ground of being as that the relations have ontological.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Don't think about this temporally, because that's a mistake, but they have ontological priority over the velata, the things that are bound in to the relations. And that way you can ground intelligibility and information as fundamental, well, I don't see any word I use in appropriate, but fundamental features of reality, even that word is inappropriate.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:19:10.000
And then what you see, and it's this sort of grand, unifying field theory of Western spirituality, then you see Zen gathering together elements of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintoism, and also coming to a very convergent kind of, no, no, underneath it, right, is it, right?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:29.000
It's actually the interconnectedness and the interconnectedness and time, relationality is the deepest ground, and you have, you have like a philosopher in the West like Heidegger trying to open us back up to that, and then you have the Kyoto school in, right, in Japan, trying to bridge between this.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:45.000
And what that brings back, what that brings up is the possibility of what I call the philosophical Silk Road. The Silk Road belonged to no one, and it allowed people to commerce, not only a commerce of things, but a commerce of ideas, but they needed a lingua franca.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:20:00.000
And it was sort of Neoplatonism from the West, and Zen from the East, and then there also seems to be interactions with Vedanta and other things. And what it gives you is it gives you, right, nobody owns this.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:20.000
No, just like nobody owns English, but it gives people a grammar, right, a deep grammar by which they can, right, they can enter into these large scale recreations of fundamental understanding of human being in the world.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:36.000
And so I think that's a real possibility for us. And we, by the way, there's a, there's a, there's a long history of trying to bridge between, there's, there's a, there's like 40 years of history in the West of what's called Zen Christianity, where people have been mapping Zen.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:58.000
This is something that people are, are, are. No, I'm not saying that the religion of the future is Zen Neoplatonism. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is these two could be brought into, because they have important differences, they could be brought into a profound opponent processing that could be that from which the

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:15.000
acceptation can occur. That's that side of the project. The other side of the project is, can we build ecologies of practices? Can we build networks of communities like what happens in the early Christian church? Can we, can we, and can we get them integrated with our best understanding of meaning making of religion?

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:29.000
Can we build these communities? Can we build these ecologies of practices? Can we network them together? And I'm invested in involved in creating that and trying to get, can we get this and this going together? And the hope is, out of that can emerge the possible

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:39.000
acceptation. And it has to be as different from the Axial religions as the Axial religions were from the Bronze Age religions. That's the proposal.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:22:01.000
It's a project, even. Now notice what I'm not saying. I'm not saying I'm going to make this. What I'm going to say is, can I get the very best of what drew everything together, draw it together, put it into a living community, living ecologies of practices, so that there's a possibility that the sacred could speak to us again. That's what I'm proposing.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I think the sacred is beginning to speak to us again. That's my observation.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Yes.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:32.000
And I notice one of the nice things for me is that a lot of young people are very interested in my ideas and extremely dissatisfied with the thin gruel of, if you can call it a philosophy, by which our civilization now lives or fails to thrive.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:53.000
So I think there's a thirst for it. And I think it can't be compelled in any way. I don't believe we can invent religions at will at any rate. I think they grow organically or are founded by communities in a way that we don't need to think about reinventing religions.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:21.000
There are religious traditions, wisdom traditions, spirituality traditions that are very robust. I've become less enthusiastic about a kind of spiritual sense that is sort of made up to do with, you know, I don't want to sound patronizing, but there are some kind of almost pseudo religious cults that are growing up,

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:38.000
that I think could be quite worrying, actually, because a religion carries with it a lot of power. That's why it's one of the few ways in which we can exert power, not we can exert power, but power can be exerted through us for good.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I'm not saying it couldn't be for bad as well. That is part of what I'm saying. But if we have to think of the things that we really need, like this closely or more closely bound society in which we learn to trust one another and share values, that's extraordinarily important.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:18.000
I can't remember his name, but I think a third century Chinese emperor said, for a civilization, there are three things that are important. Guns, food and trust. If you have to give up one, give up guns. If you have to give up another, give up food. But if you give up trust, you cannot survive.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:34.000
And that is what we are losing very, very fast. There's a sort of way in which people now think which is that if I can get away with it, I should. So in other words, we're relying on external pressures, external constraints, external restraints on us.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:56.000
And if they aren't there, then we can just do anything, which is not, obviously it's not any kind of morality, but it's also very dangerous because at some point faced with that kind of philosophy, it will be impossible to constrain and restrain everybody who wishes to do wicked things.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:18.000
So I think that's, I want to just say a few things. It may take a few minutes, but so I think it will provide many things. It will provide a kind of structure, philosophical framework, a sense of a tradition through which we can re-experience something very beautiful.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Beautiful good and true in my view, which is what the greatest art of our civilization has produced.

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:40.000
And I'm not here excluding other civilizations as anyone who reads my work will know I derive a lot from Chinese, Japanese, Indian and other kinds of cultures.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:26:09.000
So there's that. And I think also there is something highly motivating, which is, I think it's very important that we get away from the idea that we are simply passive here in this world, that we come into it and certain things sort of are blasted at us and we are receptive or non-receptive to them rather like a photographic plate or a sound recorder.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I don't believe that's the way it works on a whole number of levels. The first is that I think we have responsibilities on several levels and this needs to be said because it's not known anymore.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:31.000
One is, and I know you would share this, that the way in which we attend to things changes what there is to attend to.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:53.000
And that means that we are, whether we like it or not, we have a moral responsibility to be careful about how we use and how we dispose our attention because we can create bad things by attending in a certain way or we can produce a good result by attending in another way with a different disposition of one's heart and mind.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:13.000
So I think that's one. I think another is that we may actually in some sense help to bring about, at a more cosmic level, a turn for good, for promoting the sacred.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:35.000
So my model of whatever it is that we mean by the divine ground of being is not that it's just sort of sitting there passively, but that it is interacting with its creation, the creation that it has grounded, and that it is coming to know more of itself and its creation is coming to know more of itself in the dance of evolution that the two do together.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:44.000
This is really a Whiteheadian idea, but it's one I find compelling as I find much of Whiteheads philosophy deeply compelling.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:57.000
And I think there are other ways to that we can help prepare things in a way which is, even if we don't succeed is a fine project to devote our lives to.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:19.000
So, in the Lurianic cabala, there is a story of creation which is rather different from the one in Genesis, but it begins with the divine being the ground of being ends off, bringing something into existence because ends off is essentially relational, the foundations of everything are relational.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:29.000
And I believe, and I think you have said this too, that I certainly think the relationships are prior to Relata relations are the foundations of everything.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:37.000
And the Relata come out of the network of relations at the intersection points. We see things that attract our attention. There's a thing.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:48.000
So if that's the case, then anyway, you'd expect this divine being to want to create something that was other than itself in order to have a relationship with it.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:29:05.000
And if God is as is held in almost all spiritual traditions, love, then love needs to have another and it needs also not to compel that other, because it cannot, it cannot love something that is under entirely predictable and under its control.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:23.000
So that view of the cosmos, which I think is wonderfully developed in Christianity through the idea of a God that makes himself vulnerable by a creation that is free, either to reciprocate his love or not reciprocate it.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I want to come back to the cabalistic story. So the first act of this creative God is not to stretch out a hand and make something happen.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:41.000
It's to withdraw. It's to rein itself in so that there's a space for something other. That's called Sim Tsong, which simply means withdraw.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:55.000
And then the second phase is called Shepharat Hekellim, which means the shattering of the vessels, because in this space that's been created, there are 12 vessels and a single spark comes out of it and it often lands on the vessels and shatters them.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:03.000
In fact, it only shatters eight out of the 12, explaining why it would take me too long. So let's just accept that.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:20.000
And then the third phase, in which humanity, according to the Judea tradition, has a particular role that only it is capable of carrying out, which is to repair the shattering, to couldn't repair.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:32.000
And the idea is that we are tasked with creating again these vessels so that they are more beautiful than they were before they were shattered.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:49.000
And the image that always comes to mind for me here is the Japanese art of Kintsugi, whereby a piece of ceramics that is broken is repaired, sometimes with lines of gold, and is considered more special, more precious, more beautiful afterwards than it was before.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Now, if it is true that we have the capacity to see how to repair things, and no other beings can see that, and I think that is probably right, there's no disrespect to the rest of animal life, that probably we have this ability to see other things and see beyond and foresee things in a way that they probably don't.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:26.000
So I think if that's the case, then we have a special role there, and we may even have a role in bringing about the existence of God, because that may sound very strange, and possibly blasphemous, but the way in which I think this works is like this.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:41.000
We all know Pascal's wager, Pascal's wager with a simple one, either there is a God or there isn't. If there is a God, then it's very important that we should recognize and reciprocate our relationship with that God.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:46.000
If there is no God, then it won't do us any harm to behave as if there was a God.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:32:05.000
But I think there's a third possibility, which is McGilchrist's wager, and it has the first two of Pascal in it, but there was a third one, which is that maybe we play a role in the development, the evolution, the furtherment, the fulfillment of whatever is divine.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:19.000
So if that's the case, then once again we have an incredibly ennobling obligation, which is to make sure that we do help that good progress in the world.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:30.000
So on various levels to do with how we dispose our attention, the role we play in repair, the role we play in furthering and bringing about the divine, we can influence things.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:46.000
And we may not be able to stop certain specific wars or whatever, but that's never been part of what is imaged here. Part of what is imaged here is that we, like it or not, are gathered up into something that we have to respond to.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And I believe that the reason for the being life at all, and especially human life, is because whatever it is that is the ground of being needs response, it needs that response.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:09.000
And while it can be satisfied by the response of the inanimate world up to a point, what life brings, because I believe all life is sacred, but also the inanimate is sacred as well.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:26.000
The difference is not that one suddenly is involved with consciousness and the other isn't. I think they're both manifestations of consciousness, but the thing about life is that it can respond enormously much faster and to a greater extent so that things can move

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:43.000
instead of having to wait for this very slow, slow process with creatures like us that can be an acceleration of the evolution of the cosmos and the divine being that grounds that cosmos together.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:59.000
So, all in all, there is an enormously optimistic in my view and real and I'm a skeptical person in many ways, but I'm also skeptical of skepticism when it rules things out that we should open ourselves to.

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And if I'm honest about my thinking, my reading, my experience of life as a person, as a doctor and so on, I do believe that this is the way the cosmos is and how we relate to it.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:20.000
And that is surely something that brings hope, brings dignity to the human condition.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:30.000
And it also takes the burden of having to solve certain specific problems. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to solve those specific problems. We must.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:42.000
But it's innocent secondary. It's like the role of the the the emissary is to get on and find ways of, you know, purifying the oceans. This is terribly important.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:52.000
But it mustn't stop there because as I say, you could purify the oceans. You could save the rainforest. And the only reason we did that was for our own economy and for our own flourishing.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:35:11.000
We would have lost the main reason, which is because these things are powerful, beautiful, rich, complex entities that have their value in themselves. They are intrinsic in their nature, not of extrinsic use to us.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Do you have a question or do you want to reply?

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Go ahead.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:29.000
First of all, I share that vision in a lot of ways. As I mentioned, Kabbalah comes out of the intersection of Neoplatonism with Judaic thought.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:43.000
But what I what I would like to try and afford and not make, and there's a big difference, you don't make wisdom, you cultivate it. You don't do nothing. You cultivate the conditions and it has to take us and it has to flower.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Right.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:56.000
I would like to afford something that can work at the global level that needs to be addressed here, given the novelty of the global level of the problems that Daniel is.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:07.000
So I'm trying to find something that is properly pluralistic. So running through Whitehead and running through Kabbalah and running through Sufism is this Neoplatonic framework.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:16.000
And then running through many things in, for lack of a better word, I don't like the word, but the East, right, is its end sensibility.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Absolutely.

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:25.000
And then there's ways in which really helpfully they converge, but they differ. So proper opponent processing between them is possible.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:36.000
And the idea is this could take on a life of its own such that something could, well, it exact out of it, emerge out of it. That's what I'm proposing.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:52.000
So I think that's needed because we need something where, like the Silk Road, everybody can participate in it, but the Christian can go on the Silk Road and then return with their Christianity enriched.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:37:05.000
The Buddhists can go on the Silk Road and return and Buddhism is rich, but there's also something that's alive at a global level that is also affording something new to be born.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
That's the proposal I'm making.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I agree with you. And there was nothing in what I said that suggested that it was restricted in its scope.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Yes.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:26.000
In fact, I was talking about the way in which we actually have power, which is not mechanistic and therefore to do with the effects of individual actions.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Yes.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:39.000
It's a relationship with the cosmos, in fact. And, you know, one of the great sayings, of course, is to live the change or be the change that you wish to see.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:47.000
And so in all these movements, I think there has to begin with one's own orientation and one's public commitments.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Yes.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:49.000
These two go hand in hand.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Yes.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:54.000
You can't instill wisdom. It's not like that.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.000
But you can follow people or admire people or model yourself on people.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:15.000
We all do this whether we realize it or not. We have people that we have thought exceptionally inferential and venerable that we don't somehow have rules about how to be that kind of person.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:22.000
We know intuitively there is this kind of a person and we get moved towards what that is. And so, sorry, do you want to come in?

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000
Well, there's two things about that. One is, yes, there's empirical evidence supporting this.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:38.000
That the singularly most predictive of people aspiring and carrying out an aspirational project, properly aspirational, not utilitarian, but I should be better than I am.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Yes.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Yes, absolutely.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
That's the thing and that's the perspectival.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Exactly.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:55.000
And then the second thing is, you know, what Thich Nhat Hanh said, the next Buddha is the Sangha. I think there's a way in which the role model doesn't have to necessarily be an individual.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000
It can be a community in a powerful and new way that is also something.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
We also need that.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Yeah.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:09.000
And if there's going to be regeneration and, you know, tomorrow I'm going to Bristol to take part in the local futures symposium.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:17.000
The idea there being that if there's a future for us, we must generate it locally. We mustn't rely on the global everything to supply us.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:31.000
We must start growing our food locally and trusting and using the contributions and gifts of those around us, not just through an abstract machine like Amazon.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Now, I mean, that may be difficult, but it's an important aspiration and I think it's necessary too.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:41.000
So we need to be balancing in the sense of opponent processes.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Yes.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:49.000
We need to be able to pick up the things that need to be done at a global level, but we also need to be modeling that at the local level.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And what we need to do is create the circumstances in which wisdom can grow because it can't be made to happen.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:06.000
All you can do is stifle it or permit it. It's like a gardener cannot make a plant. The gardener can either permit the plant to flourish or stifle it.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:11.000
This brings up a place where I was wanting to go, which has to do with more local religion.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Yeah.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:23.000
First, I just want to acknowledge you were kind of reifying choice that we're not just receptive beings here, but we have choice and inherent to reifying choice was obligation.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:29.000
And that obligation was not imposed from the outside, but was the result of the kind of recognition.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:37.000
And I really like that. I think that's an important thing, that obligation, wisdom, restraint, I think are all going to be critical topics.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:45.000
And as you said, we can't impose that on people. We cannot mechanistically make it, but it can be cultivated.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:57.000
To your project, the idea of a deeply respectful giving the benefit of the Tao inquiry into the previous religious, philosophic endeavors that had some success.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:08.000
And some kind of synthesis, not homogenization, but a synthesis that recognizes that they might orient towards different but meaningful things and holding those together useful.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I think this is really good. And I am appreciating that you said Western and certain Eastern things.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:20.000
But what comes to mind is that both what we call the Western and Eastern traditions are very new relative to most of sapient history.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:28.000
And there's a reason I'm saying this that isn't just kind of like the obligate point to point out that there is a global south and there's things pre-civilization.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:38.000
There's actually a really important reason I bring it up is if we've had some hundreds of thousands of years of sapient existence,

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.000
and we've only had these kinds of religious, philosophic structures for some small number of thousands of years.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Most of human experience is in this other thing. And a big part of it was that it was always local.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.000
And that means that it wasn't trying to create a mimetic structure that's scaled.

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:05.000
And there's something intrinsic to mimetic structures that scale that goes along with techno-economic military structures that scale that I think is worth exploring a little bit.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:14.000
You were mentioning in one of your talks that intelligibility is not just about abstraction, where all the differences go away.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Being able to notice uniqueness and instantiation and distinction.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Difference has to be as real as sameness. And that's the fundamental challenge to reductionism.

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Reductionism says only what things haven't shared is the same, counts as real.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:36.000
So there's something about scale, standardization, and reduction that go together very well.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.000
This has been pointed out that this is deep to the post-modern critique.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000
And wisdom cultivation is always unique to the moment. It's not trolley problems.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.000
It's instantiated what is a good choice in this moment utilizing all of the capabilities.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Left hemisphere, right hemisphere, all the chakras, however you want to think about it.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:57.000
And also unique to this person, unique to this time and context.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:07.000
So I find it interesting that almost every indigenous wisdom tradition that developed in much smaller contexts,

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:11.000
where everyone had much more intimate relationships to each other, rather than abstracted relationship,

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
we're all Christian, we're all Hindu, whatever, that they were all animistic.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:23.000
And so in terms of the Catholic and Hindu conversation around is God transcendent or God eminent,

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.000
if anything aired on the eminent side, right, that the Creator is indwelling within the creation.

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000
And if the Creator is indwelling within the creation, maybe also beyond any part of it.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.000
So transcendent, not meaning elsewhere, but beyond any aspect.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:44.000
But in dwelling in each aspect, then any destruction of anything is sin, is a violation of the sacred.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:49.000
There's something about airing in the direction of eminence that is less dangerous.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Airing in the direction of eminence, yes.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:59.000
And there's something about also at the small scale, like we're talking, we're having a conversation,

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000
a lot of people are going to get to see, but we're not necessarily taking people through a practice

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.000
that is inducing the kinds of states, the right hemispheric state where the numinous is there, right?

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:13.000
Where the sacred is there, where the intimacy is there, and I don't want to violate something I'm intimate with.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:19.000
There's something about the small scale that has high intimacy, high touch,

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.000
in which I'm not relating to the abstract concept of they're Christians, they're on my side,

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
they're not Hindus on the other side or whatever.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000
I'm relating to this unique person, and this one, and this one.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000
It is inherently, I think, hemispherically different.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:41.000
I was also thinking about, so I'm curious how much you see hemispheric dominance having to do with scaling is one question.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I'm also very curious about, and I've had other friends want to ask you this,

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.000
if matriarchal and metrophocal cultures had any difference in this particular way,

02:44:51.000 --> 02:45:01.000
given the, is there a evolutionary difference in tending the babies and tending life at warrants in this way?

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:07.000
And then we come back to the challenge that we have global scale problems that have global drivers.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.000
If the Chinese are, the US has to, and because the US is, the Chinese have to, we have to deal with that.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:21.000
But scaling, if it involves standardization, abstraction, and a loss of instantiation, is inherently part of the problem.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:27.000
So how do we get something that is profoundly instantiated, profoundly unique, profoundly local,

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:33.000
and also cultivate that in a way that has the distribution that it needs?

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Yeah. I'm sympathetic to animism.

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:53.000
And one interesting thing here is if you experimentally suppress the left hemisphere for, say, 10 or 15 minutes,

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:59.000
people describe things that they would normally consider inanimate as animate.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:06.000
So they see the sun as animate moving across the sky and giving energy.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:14.000
And if you do the opposite and suppress the right hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as living as not.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:20.000
So people are like bits of furniture, like zombies or simply machines.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:26.000
So there is a clear difference now. I'm so fascinated. I'm a panentheist.

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:36.000
I think that's an important analogy, if you like, but it goes further than animism and it manages to bring together eminence and transcendence.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:40.000
So pantheism simply says God is all the stuff that there is.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Panentheism says God is in all the stuff that there is, and all the stuff that is, is in God.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:47:01.000
I think that is a, maybe we don't need to explore that too much, but I would say that is a very, to me, important and sounds to me, feels to me a wise way of thinking about the world.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:15.000
And would also, if taken seriously, stop us fighting between religious groups and would stop us just spoiling the natural world and would instill the sense of proper reverence.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:21.000
And there's nothing, of course, in religion that says that we've got to see ourselves over and against other people.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:26.000
In fact, in many religions, your first duty is those who are not of your kind.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I mean, I know that's part of Zoroastrianism, actually, but it's also in Christianity.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:39.000
And that doesn't mean that the history of these religions has not been a war between those who really understood the mystical meaning of it,

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:52.000
and those who used it as a lever for power and influence and for adversarial approaches, paragraphs.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.000
So, all of that, now you said something else.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:59.000
How do we, what was the first thing that you did?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Scale.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:09.000
Yeah, the thing about scale actually brings me to something that I was thinking when I was listening to your talk to the Consilience Project or conference,

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:28.000
which is that you made the important point that what gives something a sense of reality and tells us something about itself is in the differences, not in the sameness.

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.000
But of course we need to be able to aggregate things in order to be able to live.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:36.000
We can't experience everything as new and original and unique.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Of course.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:41.000
And both hemispheres generalize, actually, but in different ways.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:55.000
So the left hemisphere generalizes by, there's a feature here that they have in common, whereas the right hemisphere generalizes by there being a sort of what Wittgenstein called a family resemblance.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:00.000
There being a general gestalt holding together of things.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:21.000
But what's it really intriguing is people think that because the left hemisphere is focused on detail, that it must somehow not involve generalization and that because the right hemisphere sees the whole, it's neglectful of the individual case.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:29.000
It turns out that to understand the unique case is very strongly dependent on the right temporary parietal region.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
It's the right hemisphere that understands uniqueness.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:38.000
The left hemisphere doesn't understand uniqueness because it's already categorized things as I see it's another one of those and goes in that box.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:49.000
So there's a huge literature on that and some of it that I reported in my previous books, but the point there is that there are two ways of thinking of the small if you like.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.000
One is the tiny part that is a detail.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.000
The other is the uniqueness of something which is not strictly measurable.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
It's how big is the uniqueness of your wife?

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.000
You know, excuse me, this is not a sensible question.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:15.000
And also in generalizing the right hemisphere doesn't generalize in the sense of trying to find a way in which it all fits a known schema, but sees the bigger picture.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Whereas the left hemisphere manages to get that wrong by not seeing the bigger picture but seeing lots of examples that can be generalized.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:34.000
So the conflict between sameness or oneness on the one hand and difference and multiplicity on the other crosses the hemispheres in a recognizable different way.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:44.000
And I think what's important about union and division is that we need them both, not just one, but we need them to be unified, not divided.

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.000
So the meta level union trumps division, but it must not abolish division.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:59.000
So we need in our in our ontology to be able to at least distinguish, but that distinction doesn't mean there's an irreparable separation.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:12.000
And unfortunately, the way we talk we often think that if we differentiate we've completely divided and sundered, whereas it's very important to realize that distinction is enormously important to be able to discriminate differences.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Is what we have a mindful functioning of and how we come to experience the multiplicity of life, but it doesn't entail us in in in a sort of abandonment of a sense of the togetherness as well.

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Well, I'd like to reply to that and reply to both of you.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:46.000
And again, and the argument I was making at the Consolian's conference is that intelligibility is actually the complete togetherness of the integration and the differentiation.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Exactly.

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:48.000
So that's good.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Yeah.

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:53.000
But like there has to be both for there to be intelligibility.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:54.000
We agreed then.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Right.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:02.000
And then the neoplateness we're very much on about that the one is that it is not the one of the numerical sequence.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:08.000
We're not only using that word because they're so they go on and on about this is not the numerical one.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:16.000
This is not we're talking about the oneness of of integration and differentiation, which are very hard.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
There is no logical oneness between them.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:25.000
There is the deeper oneness of intelligibility upon which logic rest logic logic presupposes that deeper thing.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
And therefore we're called to it.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:36.000
And what they get to see we we were Cartesian and we think the appearance reality distinction is just the inner outer the subjective objective.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:41.000
The ancient world has had a different way of understanding the appearance reality distinction.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.000
It was the one mini, which is the problem we're talking about.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:56.000
And it and what it did is it said, there's a deep reflection of neoplatonism on intelligibility and the one in the midi, the emergence up the emanation down to completely

02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:14.000
right. What it came to in like the coincidence of the opposites is this idea, right, that skiancia intuitiva, right, that you have to be able to see the whole and every part and the part as properly participating in all of the whole.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:19.000
You get the same thing in the Zen, not the same thing. Sorry, wrong word. That's a logical word.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:25.000
You get something convergent from the Zen tradition in Indra's net, how everything is the center of everything else.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.000
And that it's a different way of framing things.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:40.000
And I would also say the transcendent and imminent have to be completely interpenetrating and you see late neoplatonist like Nicholas of Cusa and like Erogeena proposing this.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:53.000
I'm worried about our category of animism because for me it sounds like us trying to capture this transjectivity and this transjectivity and then stick it into substantial things, which I think is, I'm worried about that.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:54:03.000
For example, I don't think life is a property of an organism. I think it's a property of an organism in relationship to its environment in a profound way.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:22.000
And so again, I think we're agreeing and I'm just trying to say that I think that if we can teach people sets of practices that get them to realize this is a deep ontological truth, then they will be called to new ways.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:29.000
And we can't say what they're going to be, but they can be called to new ways of bringing the small and the large.

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:37.000
I'm not happy with even those words, the imminent and the trans, but they'll be called to new ways beyond our current grammar for how to bring them into relation.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.000
That would be, that would be for me evidence that the new religion is emerging.

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.000
What do you think about that?

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Well, I'm curious, because the term new religion is provocative and especially, right, especially in the presence of there being existing religions that have billions of people in them.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:04.000
I don't think you mean that has to replace or supersede those existing ones. I think it can reify them.

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Yes.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:17.000
And I think, you know, we probably all agree that all of the religions have different ways of interpreting them, some of which lead to holy war and some of which lead to sacred responsibility in different ways.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:31.000
And so the question of, because it's very interesting, obviously, Zen and Vedanta and Lurianic obelism and Christianity are culturally different historically, mytho poetically.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:39.000
But you could say that there might be certain underlying structures they all have to have to orient the human adequately.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.000
There's almost like a meta-metaphysics that is necessary.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Where does it get the relationship of the one and the many? Does it get the relationship of the determined and the free? Does it get all of those things?

02:55:50.000 --> 02:56:10.000
And it might be that those meta-dynamics have both the capability of giving rise to new philosophic inquiries as well as reifying the versions of the existing ones that are capable of being in a harmonious relationship with the other ones

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:16.000
and capable of being able to understand and steward the power of our technology well.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Which I would say, if a religion doesn't do that, it's not adequate for the purpose of being able to orient humans in the world today to steward the world.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
You almost sung that and it was beautiful.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Yes.

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Sorry, I got into that.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:45.000
So then I think one question I have for you, since you've been thinking about this project, but for all of us, is how might we imagine the reification of the existing religions

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:58.000
in a direction that allows them to have something meaningful to say about ecological overshoot and planetary boundaries and AI and synthetic bioregulation and the war in Ukraine and whatever?

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:09.000
To orient them to be able to play a role in the stewarding of the world, in the development of the wisdom individually, but the stewarding of the world locally and not just locally, because it's all that.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:19.000
How might we see the reification of those religions and the development of new ones or at least new philosophic metaphysical systems?

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:26.000
And then how do we see the interface of those with the other systems of human coordination?

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.000
If I value things differently, does my economic system change?

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:36.000
If I have a different relationship to what is a good problem to solve, does my tech design change?

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.000
How does education and media change since those are affecting the nature of human minds so profoundly?

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:53.000
So the reification of the religions, the development of new philosophic traditions, but also the development of those, when we say you can't force it but you can garden or nurture it, how do you imagine being able to garden and nurture

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:57.000
the type of adequate wisdom moving forward in all these ways?

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Can I just ask you a little terminological thing? You used the word reify and reification a lot.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
He uses it positively.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I know, but do you mean validation?

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Sure.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:11.000
Because reification to me means making it a thing, and of course that's what we don't want to make it.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:14.000
So I mean...

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:15.000
...signifying.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:28.000
So when I was saying to reify, I mean to be able to interpret the religion in a particular direction that is commensurate with what it must be, given the constrained humanity faces.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.000
So there's kind of like a pragmatic forcing function on the metaphysics.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:42.000
It's like ray in the respect, looking at it, probably, right? That's how I was getting it, and you're nodding, so I think that's lining.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:46.000
What is the real interpretation is what the scholars will argue on.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:51.000
So there's an interpretation of what does this really mean that can be different.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:59:00.000
And also, as you said, we're not just painting meaning on the walls of a meaningless universe, but there is actually something intrinsically real they're pointing to.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:04.000
There is, but there's no one way as you were saying it.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000
That's very important.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:14.000
That's what I was saying, is that there's something like almost like how every personality, very healthy, psychologically healthy people don't all become the same.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Right? As we become psychologically healthier, we don't become the same.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Cultures also wouldn't become the same, but they would be, and the culture is almost like the psychology of the many.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
The religion could be thought of that way.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Yeah, but that's how proper pluralism differs from the relativism.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Let's use a biological analogy.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.000
There are universal principles of evolution, but evolution doesn't say that all the creatures are going to be the same.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:43.000
It in fact tells you that all the creatures are going to be very different and intellectually sensitive, not only spatially, but temporally.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:49.000
So there can be universal principles that predict why you must be contextually sensitive.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Yes.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.000
And I think that's the kind of thing I'm trying to point us towards.

02:59:53.000 --> 03:00:02.000
And then what you can do with, I mean, I think Ian has said this off camera and me too.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:11.000
I got a lot of people that come to me and say, you've given me a language so that I can go back and re-home myself in the religion I was brought up in.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:18.000
And then you can think of, and you can think about that homing process is a much deeper kind of education than what we now have.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:23.000
It's closer to what Zach is talking about when he's talking about education as an installment, et cetera.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:28.000
So let's talk about that kind of education and then we could properly empower people.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Let's do a concrete example.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Okay, let's see the proposal I've been making, not just me, people like Filler, a whole bunch of people, Carson, I think all these people are wrapping into this in powerfully.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:41.000
But Filler makes this argument, and one of his reasons for focusing.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Look, really try to get, really, really, try to get that the trinity within Christianity is saying that relationality is primordial.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Really get it.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Don't think of this as three guys stuck together.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Think about them completely interpenetrating, interconnecting, relationality, intelligibility, the logos, the reality, the indwelling in people, the spirit.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:08.000
See, all of that is deeply profoundly relational.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Go back and start to practice your practices that way, live that way.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:20.000
And then people are going to find different things relevant and salient in the world and their relationship to the world.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:26.000
And it could open up, like it could switch people from the having mode to the being mode.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:34.000
It could make a difference in their relationship to their spouses, but also in their relationship to economic systems.

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
You understand this.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Yes.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:49.000
The pragmatic question I'm asking is, so let's say the Vatican calls you up and says, we agree.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:59.000
We would like to have a uniquely Catholic version of this, and maybe we're stoked if there's a uniquely Muslim and a uniquely Hindu kind of enlightenment of similar types.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.000
But we would like a kind of Catholic version.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:06.000
How would you change the way we approach our practices, philosophy, et cetera?

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Or let's say that the minister of the Department of Education reached out and said, we want to implement K through 12, a wisdom development process.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:25.000
I'm very interested to hear your thoughts on how could the institutions start to actually implement wisdom development practices.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:32.000
Insights, philosophies, such that rather than just we're compelling the person on YouTube.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.000
So this is where I think it's different from Zach.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:45.000
I think we have to create enough ecologies of practices within the community before a reformation of education becomes possible.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:53.000
Because unless the lived normativity of the culture changes, attempts to change the education will just be co-opted by the current machinery.

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:57.000
So we have to start inside education long enough to see how that works.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Everybody gets, you've got to do stuff with the parents, and you've got to do stuff with the culture.

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:05.000
If the kids are getting trained for the market, that has inherent limitations.

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:09.000
So it becomes tricky because to change anything, you have to change everything.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000
So there's some sequencing.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
You can't start with one thing.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
You've got to do lots of things together.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Exactly.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Which if you change the grounding that has led to the problems we have, will lead naturally to these things flourishing at the slightly higher level.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:28.000
But how we do that has got to be through an implicit process.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Because if we try to, as I'm constantly saying, if we try to instigate the things we think are valuable into people, we have not instigated those things.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:43.000
Instead, we've instigated a kind of chain of thought, which is actually contrary to the way in which we...

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
This is your very first book, right?

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Yeah.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.000
Cannot make implicit things explicit without damaging them.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:51.000
Yeah, that's right.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Because again, it's criticism.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.000
Yeah.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:56.000
So Apollonia's argument was...

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:59.000
And this is Plato's argument, too.

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
You can't make people wise.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:08.000
You can properly, again, seduce them so that they can come to love with stuff.

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
But I was getting on to say that, really.

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.000
I mean, all I was going to say is we can't do it by a direct approach.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:18.000
But we can do it by a more implicit and less direct approach.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:28.000
And that approach is actually, sadly, not original, but it is actually to start re-educating.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:31.000
I mean, or educating, what I'm trying to say.

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:35.000
I think we stopped educating children about 40, 50 years ago.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:42.000
We started indoctrinating them and giving them information and testing them on how much of that they've retained.

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:46.000
But we didn't do the really important things, which are relational.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:52.000
All the people who really inspired me and taught me did so by their being who they were.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:58.000
And by the way in which the spark jumped across the gaps in the way that Plato describes in the Seventh Epistle,

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:02.000
that this is how philosophy is done, not by writing it down.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:07.000
I mean, mysteriously, Plato completely betrayed psychocraties into doing this.

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:14.000
So we need to reimagine what an education is.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:19.000
That would mean freeing up teachers from a dead weight of bureaucracy.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:23.000
In fact, that's one of the very practical things that could be done tomorrow,

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:29.000
which would be go around universities, go around hospitals, go around schools,

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:35.000
and look very critically at all the superstructure of management and so on.

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:40.000
And I reckon about 80% of that could go tomorrow and nobody would suffer.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:44.000
In fact, there'd be a lot more money for doing the things that we really want to do.

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:53.000
We've become sucked by a parasite, if you like, which is the externalization of the left hemisphere's drive for control,

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:56.000
which is administration.

03:05:56.000 --> 03:06:00.000
And so, I mean, that's a practical answer to the question.

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:07.000
But also, we need, apart from freeing up teachers to teach in a way that is individual responsive

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:11.000
and alive rather than just a carrying out of procedures,

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:17.000
we need actually to, I'm sorry, give people back their cultural tradition.

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:20.000
They need to read literature.

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:24.000
It's not fashionable to say this, but they need to understand the last 2000 years,

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
otherwise they don't know what they're doing here.

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
They have a very shallow rooting.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:37.000
So we actually do need to teach history, literature, philosophy, music, all like, not just IT,

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:46.000
not just procedural learning, but actually creative, empathic understanding of other people,

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:50.000
not sitting in judgment on our forebears or on other cultures,

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:54.000
but in fact, trying to see our way into how they saw the world.

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
But I'm stupider than we are.

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
And they might actually have seen something we've lost.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Okay, so I have a proposal specifically, more practically, about this, which is,

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:08.000
first of all, I'll put a pin in something.

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:15.000
The problem we face, of course, is the bureaucracy has wrapped itself around a pseudo-religious ideology that justifies this.

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.000
Absolutely.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:17.000
Tremendously.

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:18.000
So that's problematic.

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:19.000
It's a pseudo-religion.

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:20.000
Yes, very much.

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:26.000
And what I would want to say is, I don't think we should have teachers in any one institution.

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:30.000
So if you look, I'll just take the West, but there's parallel things elsewhere.

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:36.000
You had the university, you had the monastery, and you had the church, and they were all interrelated.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:40.000
And one is a knowledge institution, but it has reverence for the wisdom institution,

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:41.000
or that's the monastery.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:46.000
And then you have the church, and the church is, oh, but all of these ideas and all of these philosophies have to be,

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:49.000
have to transfer to real lives.

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
If I may just add, also hospitals.

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
Yes, yes, yes.

03:07:53.000 --> 03:08:04.000
And what I think we need is we need to have teachers in multiple kinds of institutions that are acting again in this opponent processing with each other,

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:05.000
not adversarial.

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:09.000
Part of the problem is, you know, and then the Protestant Reformation comes in and splits them from each other,

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
and we get all that, all that.

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:18.000
But the proposal is, because what we have is we have this idea that teachers are only legitimate if they're in this one,

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:24.000
institution, and that, and if we have anybody out, I face this.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:28.000
But the stuff I do outside of the university is like, why are you doing that?

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Why are you doing that?

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:30.000
All right.

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:38.000
And I know lots of excellent teachers that can't find a home in the university because they want to do the kind of stuff that universities

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
don't any longer do.

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Right.

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:51.000
And I think we need to think about, we need to think of a living system of teaching institutions where you've got people sort of,

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:55.000
but they're bound together in a field again where the relationality is important.

03:08:55.000 --> 03:09:00.000
This is the pole of knowledge, this is the pole of wisdom, and this is the pole of life.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
And they have to all, and we have that.

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:10.000
And I think that's also something that we need to think about bringing back in terms of institutional structures that can actually transform society in the way we're talking.

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:22.000
And I'd like to just add, sorry, we need to encourage and provide institutional support for people who are bright to oversee the whole picture to some extent.

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:23.000
Yes.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
That doesn't happen in our culture anymore.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:35.000
It used to happen, and it used to happen in this university, but now everything has shifted here as everywhere else in the Western world towards ever greater specialization.

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:36.000
Yes.

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:39.000
And now we need specialists, of course we do.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.000
It's not one or the other.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:48.000
We need people who also are able to take the broad right hemisphere view and see, Cracky, look what's happening here.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:52.000
And, you know, I believe that what I've done, if I've done anything in my writing, is to open people's eyes.

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:53.000
That's what they're writing here.

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:57.000
Of course, once you see it, you see what's going on here.

03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:00.000
And we don't have any institutions that do that.

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:07.000
Back in the 60s, I think the Rand Corporation and others sort of put money behind people that they thought were going to be good.

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:15.000
And they just gave them a desk and an office and a Xerox machine and said, you know, do what you want.

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:22.000
And out of that came a lot of, you know, genuinely innovative creative thinking.

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
And we need to bring that back.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Could I respond to just one thing?

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:40.000
So, because this is dear to my heart, because I represent the discipline that is all about the synoptic integration across the disciplines, cognitive science.

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:41.000
Right.

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:51.000
And trying to create the lingua franca between neuroscience and information processing, machine learning, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy.

03:10:51.000 --> 03:11:13.000
And trying to do that. And the, I mean, there, there has been a turning, an increasing recognition by some about the value of this because the specialization went into psychology in which we incentivized people to innovate something that nobody else had discovered before,

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:25.000
finding the effect, the new effect. Right. And this is one of the driving motivations of the replication crisis because if you don't pursue synoptic integration, you don't work out your theoretical grammar.

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:42.000
Well, your conceptual vocabulary is vague and equivocal. And what you and then you're the fact that you get empirical data is almost irrelevant because if you get a vague enough construct that isn't bound responsible to anybody else's work of course you can find empirical verification.

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:51.000
The replication crisis has basically started to put up a flag. Some people are recognizing it that we need the synoptic integrators as much as we need the specialists.

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
So, that's, I just want to put that.

03:11:53.000 --> 03:12:05.000
You both made this point. And I think when people look at the arguments about all the things that are supposedly getting better in civilization, some of which are they relate to things that specialization does well.

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:15.000
And when we look at the things that are getting worse and heading towards global catastrophic risk, they look at the lack of integrate, they arise from the lack of integration across specialty areas.

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:20.000
I think that's actually very important.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:35.000
So, you were speaking to that the existing educational institutions have a history that we actually want to revive some things from and that we've actually lost some very important aspects.

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:52.000
You were also speaking to not just the educational institution as a single thing but lots of them. You didn't mention guilds but also there that education needs to be many institutions and maybe in light of the current situations of the world some new institutional design as well.

03:12:52.000 --> 03:13:02.000
But you said something else that I found really interesting when you talked about cutting some of the bureaucracy and administration which was almost like an externalization of left hemispheric dominance.

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:06.000
What David Graber calls bullshit jobs.

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:22.000
There's this recursive relationship between kind of left hemispheric process and building a world that is the result of that that in turn conditions that and that kind of recursive relationship means we're not just asking how can we develop things that will give people more wholeness,

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:35.000
more integration, more numinous, more sacred but also how can we undo some of the things that are excessively making us hypertrophic on the wrong modes of mind and I think we have to do both.

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:45.000
One good thing that might come out of a scarcity crisis is that we find quickly what are the things we can dispense with and what we can't.

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:59.000
At least if we maintain enough right hemisphere overview of what's going on but I fear that now the power is concentrated in the hands of frankly mediocre people who occupy administrative jobs.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:12.000
And they're not willing to really relinquish that power and it's their validation but we do desperately need to do it and you're quite right with what happens in a culture like that.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:27.000
People are trained to go into jobs like that and the people who fit the role best are not the people you'd want to be making big decisions about our lives but they go into it and the thing is a positive feedback loop.

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:44.000
So how do we break the positive feedback loops that orient us towards the futures nobody wants and how do we or at least weaken them and how do we simultaneously develop other positive feedback loops because they have to have some positive feedback where they won't be able to do anything

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:56.000
that move us in a recognition of the sacred wise individual and collective governance. We did not answer that question in full.

03:14:56.000 --> 03:15:06.000
We spoke to different elements of what it might need to entail but the clock is saying that it is time that we must wrap.

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:16.000
Well there are questions that we can answer questions that we can offer a direction for and questions we simply can't in the nature of things answer.

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:19.000
So I think we've done the best we can.

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:20.000
Yes.

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:26.000
And I'd like to think that we could shout this from the rooftops and people some people just a few might listen.

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:37.000
So this is my kind of closing question is if some people do listen and respond and there's interest maybe we'll deepen this conversation and explore some of these.

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:50.000
How do we weaken the existing positive feedback loops. How do we deal with the fact that power is entrenched in certain ways currently like there's a lot of very interesting open questions we could get into further.

03:15:50.000 --> 03:16:12.000
But in closing thoughts of I guess now for the listeners who have made it through all of this any closing thoughts that might give them some sense of orientation or agency in the relationship to all these topics.

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
Well I'd say.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Don't despair.

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:21.000
That is achieving nothing whatever and it's bad for the soul.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:30.000
So we have a duty to see what is hopeful and do we not ask nobody has asked to do the impossible.

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:43.000
We can only do the bit that we can and that means doing things in our own life and with our own life and furthering larger causes in the way that we are best in a position to do.

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:53.000
But we all have a role and I think one of the things I try to emphasize was that although the materialist reductionist picture.

03:16:53.000 --> 03:17:02.000
Results in a vision of the cosmos as a heap of junk with no meaning beauty or purpose and that we have no role here I would.

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:18.000
You know I go to my death to defend the opposite point of view that actually it is beautiful is rich and it is our pleasure duty and something we should be grateful for to help further that.

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:28.000
I like that you said I would go to my death that's the sacrifice and service of the sacred.

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:39.000
I would want people to hear that the love of wisdom and the love of being are real possibilities that there are already.

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:55.000
People of good faith and good talent doing this individually and collectively and that that opens up a possibility for a kind of transformation so that.

03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:08.000
As you fall in love with being again instead of the reciprocal narrowing that we've been just been talking about and how we get addicted because that's what addiction is reciprocal narrowing a reciprocal opening is equally possible.

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:26.000
This is what Plato proposed with the Anagaga and that that is still actual and there are people and communities and practices that you can go to to actualize that to realize that and there is nothing stopping you from doing that right now.

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.000
May I make a hemispheric comment.

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:37.000
The left hemisphere closes down to a certainty the right hemisphere opens up to a possibility.

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:48.000
And so what you've really said is we need to further the processes of the right hemisphere which are always expanding and exploring rather than those that close down to the arid bit of something we think we know.

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:52.000
Yeah I don't want I'm not proposing cognitive closure I want continuity of contact.

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:55.000
I know you.

03:18:55.000 --> 03:19:12.000
I think the religion the concern about religions that many people have actually has to do with people orienting to certainty with them and then close mindedness and holy wars and whatever as opposed to the exact opposite holding the mystery at the center holding

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:16.000
the unspeakable the unknowable but the real.

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:20.000
And so there is an epistemic humility that is built in forever.

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:23.000
We spoke about this yesterday and you said don't despair.

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:39.000
We actually I liked in our conversation you're saying when we are actually open to the beauty of reality there's a sense of awe and gratitude and humility that comes with that.

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:47.000
But when we're open to the beauty of reality being harmed which is in the factory farm and on the war field and whatever we're also.

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:59.000
Feel the suffering of others such that it's overwhelming and the overwhelm in the suffering and the overwhelm in the beauty are related because if the reality wasn't beautiful you wouldn't care.

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:05.000
And both of them make you transcend your small self and both of them motivate the sacred obligation.

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:17.000
So there's something where the sacred obligation just comes from seeing clearly letting yourself be moved by the beauty of reality and associated with that the meaningfulness to protect it.

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:32.000
And the role of the new religion philosophy whatever in so far as it can help people be more sensitive to both the beauty and sacredness and thus a protective impulse towards reality is what I am hoping people take away.

03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000
Excellent.

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:35.000
Well, thank you face.

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
Yeah, likewise.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:38.000
This is joy.

03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:39.000
It has been a great pleasure.

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
I really enjoy the interview.
