00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Reveki. I am here with Kazara Mirzai.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
Kazara is going to be part of this ongoing discussion. We're having on this channel

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,520
with people who are practitioners and also researchers about IFS, Internal Family Systems

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,240
Theory. And I'm very excited about this. I've met Kazara offline and we've got a really interesting

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,360
conversation. I'm rather looking forward to this one. But Kazara, why don't you introduce yourself,

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,120
tell us a little bit more about your background, and then maybe we can talk about some of your work

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,120
and how it weaves into what we're doing here at the Reveki Foundation. And then we'll just take

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,400
it from there. Yes, thank you very much, John. Thanks for having me. Oh, great pleasure. Yeah,

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:56,560
so I'm a psychotherapist by training. I'm a practitioner. I'm a clinician. And I'm a researcher

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,880
and teacher at the university in Hildesheim in Germany. And what I focus on is like there are

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,120
a couple of things I focus on. So my research is on emotion regulation and developmental

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,280
psychopathology. So I'm looking mostly on adolescent, on the adolescent age and the age group. And

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:26,000
what I'm doing there is I look at how psychotherapy has an impact on it. So we know that

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,040
psychotherapy works, but we don't know why to a lot of degrees. And I have a more of a dynamical

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,120
systems theoretical view on it. And I look at affect dynamics and see how affecting emotion

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:48,640
fluctuate and have their ups and downs and look at those in especially teenagers. But at the same

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,600
time, I'm also more oriented to more global view, more theoretical view. And I'm also deeply

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:04,240
influenced by one of my doctoral supervisors, Werner Greve. He's a professor for developmental

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,080
psychology. And he's actually, I'm in this academic ancestral line of Balthus and Staudinger.

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,720
You mentioned them in the meeting process. So Werner Greve, he actually, he did his PhD under

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Paul Balthus. So he has this lifespan, lifespan perspective on, on development. And

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,080
yeah, I try to bring in those aspects, but also the theoretical aspects. And he's also deeply

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,400
into action theory and philosophical psychology. So I also follow this, this trend to look more

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
broadly onto meaning making, I would say. And this is where IFS comes in. And as a practitioner of

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:48,960
IFS and a research, I also do research on it. Yeah, I'm deeply interested in the also in the

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,400
cocci of it and the cognitive science of it. And yeah, and this whole machinery of meaning

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,080
making. So yeah, that's where I come from. What would you like to talk about first? I mean,

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:10,160
we could pick up on a particular thread and give people, you know, a more specific example of

29
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,920
what your work looks like and how it's related to meaning and the meaning crisis, perhaps that

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,840
would be great. Yeah, I think, oh, that's a good question where to start. I think there are several

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,080
paths, paths that could, that we could take. And maybe start, I know that your audience knows

32
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,000
IFS by now, but maybe just to sum up for them. I think we could, we can always talk more about

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,600
it. I mean, I, yeah, the work with, with Seth, Seth Allen, Seth Allison has been

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:53,200
really, really profound. And, but I think having many voices articulate what it is could be very

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,600
helpful to our listeners. Yes. And I really enjoyed those videos. I also wanted to extend that and

36
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,120
tell you that I think you both have done a very wonderful job. It was, it was actually really

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,320
different to experience both of you. I mean, Seth does, you know, did an excellent job. He has this

38
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,240
wonderful personality. And you also show different sides and aspects of yourself, John. So I really

39
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,760
like that too. Yeah, well, thank you for saying that. And I apologize to Seth. I think when I

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,480
first mentioned him, I confused him with Seth Dillinger. I apologize about that. But Seth Allison,

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,520
yes. Yeah, he, we spoke before time and he proposed doing this. And yeah, I knew it would be

42
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:51,440
challenging. But I thought people needed a concrete example in order to get a deeper sense of what

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,680
was going on. I agree. I agree. Hey, I think sometimes we tend to be way too abstract and

44
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,440
theoretical. So we need something to ground ourselves again. So yeah, maybe to connect to that.

45
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,440
Yeah, just really, really briefly, shortly at what I, what I think or my take on IFS is that

46
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,360
it's actually a model of a living and self organizing psyche that is composed of, I would say

47
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,600
living things. And Dick Schwartz would say sub personalities or we could call them parts.

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,040
And yeah, those interact with each other in a certain, and again, this is my language in a

49
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,920
certain qualitative space and relationship that we would call the self. And so you see again,

50
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,520
this is my notion of it. It's actually tainted there. I don't assume a monadic self. I rather

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,720
assume a relational, flexible, and the self is more as a process than a product.

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,280
So in that sense, IFS assumes the multiplicity of the psyche or a multiplicity of the psyche.

53
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,240
And yeah, I would, I would, I would want to start maybe by linking it to the meaning crisis,

54
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,160
because I think this is so deeply important. And then we can come to my work and how

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,080
my perspectives from I also forgot to mention that I worked many years in psycho oncology and

56
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,680
pediatric psycho oncology. And, and I currently work at a residential adolescent residential

57
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
crisis center where I work like with borderline personality disorders and very, very traumatized

58
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,240
young people. And I'm so confronted with this whole absurdity and the meaning crisis that

59
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:48,080
you automatically you try to find ways and try to make sense out of it. So, and I see deep,

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,400
deep connections there. And so I would say the short answer is that IFS helps both the cognitive,

61
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,760
as well as the existential and spiritual machinery of meaning making. So that's, yeah,

62
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:09,600
that's very powerful. Yeah, and I think via a dialectic, it's a dialectical approach.

63
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,640
And, and I think we can add in more mythos. And I mean, not only the logos, but also the mythos.

64
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,360
And fundamentally, IFS, again, is a dialogical practice and a form, I would say a form of

65
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,000
serious play to use one of your terms or you to use your language. And the serious play,

66
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,200
it helps to systematically modify salience, in a sense. And, and, and obviously to switch and,

67
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,600
and change perspectives. So this perspective taking is very, very important. And I think

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,400
IFS is powerful in doing so. And it helps you forward and come into contact with your,

69
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,440
yeah, with different aspects of your, of your being and your identity. And, and, and, and, and

70
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,160
doing so get a grasp on your inner conflict in a platonic sense. And to resolve, hopefully resolve

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,280
those inner conflicts. That was just, wow, that was just wonderful. So let me see, I want to,

72
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
I want to make sure I get all these. So as you mentioned, salience and perspective taking,

73
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,040
you, you mentioned people get sort of an enrichment of their self awareness. They, they

74
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,080
discover, uncover, realize different aspects of themselves. And then

75
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,840
there's also you, you were talking a little bit. Well, let's start with those three, first of all.

76
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:51,120
And then we can pick up on any threads that are remaining. So I get, I, I get that it alters

77
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:01,120
salience. Because it gets people to pay attention to things they weren't previously paying attention

78
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,560
to within their psyche. Is that the main, that's the salience? I know I might be oversimplifying.

79
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm just trying to get the initial idea. No, I think, I think that's, that's totally fair.

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,560
And, and I think there was, there was again, a machinery behind that. And I think this has deeply

81
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,480
to do with, I think, dynamical systems theory can here can help us understand what we mean also

82
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,920
by this idea of salience. So what I understand, or what I mean when I talk about salience is that,

83
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,440
and again, I would say this is deeply psychodynamic or depth psychological. That's

84
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,800
IFS is really related to that. That you're not the master in your own house. Something is driving

85
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,440
you. Right? Yeah. And that's the poconic theme you were bringing up earlier about. Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,960
Exactly. Something is driving you. So those different forces. And they have their own framing.

87
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,560
They have their own sets of glasses that they put on, right? Yeah. They see the world

88
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,440
from their perspectives, because they have their own agent arena relationship.

89
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,160
Yeah. Yeah, that's what this is what I was bringing in. And, and what I mean when I talk

90
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:20,480
about dynamical systems theory is that I think those forces that drive us, they, they are a system,

91
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,680
in a sense that they are a complex system, biological system. That's why I'm talking about

92
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,760
living things, which means, and living things are memory systems. And I think this is, this is an

93
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:41,200
aspect of dynamical systems theory that is often overlooked. But we're, it's, they are deeply,

94
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,240
so biological systems are memory systems. And this has to do with this technical notion of

95
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,800
non-urgidicity. And I don't know if we should expand on this or not, but... Well, we could.

96
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
I mean, it overlaps with some of the significant work Michael Levin's doing in some of the

97
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
conversations I've had with him. Can I, can I, can I, can I ask you a question at this point?

98
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,320
Yeah. So I get that this is wonderful. So let's at least say there are sort of autopoietic systems

99
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
right there. They, they're, they're seeing the world in a certain way, and they have a certain

100
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,160
function, and they're trying to maintain themselves and, and satisfy that function or functions. I

101
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:24,560
don't want to be simplistic. Is that okay so far? Absolutely. And then, and I like this idea of they,

102
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,200
they each have a different framing and agent arena relationship. And that means, of course,

103
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,120
they can come into conflict in some significant way. And this is the platonic model you were

104
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
alluding to earlier from the Republic, right? You've got this inner conflict. And then I,

105
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:48,720
I've been wondering about this. So I have a question to ask. So Plato posits the idea that

106
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,720
we have metadrives. We have two fundamental metadrives. One is a kind of inner justice,

107
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,600
inner peace. We, we, whatever it, however we try to satisfy our goals and our desire, sorry,

108
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,400
satisfy our desires and reach our goals. We don't want that to cause more internal conflict. We

109
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,880
want it to bring resolution to that conflict and an inner binding and an inner religio. And then we

110
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:23,920
have another important drive, which is we want to be most in contact with what is most real. We

111
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,840
don't want whatever is satisfying our goals or satisfying our desires to be illusory, fraudulent,

112
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,360
anything. And so the question is this, I, I'm not very happy with, you know, thinking about the

113
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,520
self as some sort of thing. And you seem to be also like that. You described it as a space. And I,

114
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm thinking, I'm wondering if it's a functional space. What do I mean by that is maybe perhaps

115
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,200
the self is understood as that which is these two metadrives. The self is that which is driving

116
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,000
for the resolution of inner conflict and bringing us into conflict, sorry, bringing us into contact

117
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
with reality. What do you think about that as a proposal? That that is maybe how we could understand

118
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,200
the fundamental functionality of the self. Given that you raised the platonic model, it seems like

119
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,640
there's a way of understanding the self in terms of that platonic model. That's wonderful.

120
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:21,840
Can you repeat that again? That's so, that's so rich. I have to think about this again.

121
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah. So Plato has this proposal, right? He doesn't state it like it explicitly as a,

122
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,200
as a standalone proposition, but it very clearly comes out in many places, in many dialogues,

123
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,840
most prominently in the Republic, which is the one you were alluding to, that we, we have a desire

124
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,680
for inner peace. But this is not just, that's why he also uses the word justice. It's that,

125
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes, it's the optimal gripping. It's the optimal gripping. It's this harmonic interplay, right?

126
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Yes. Yes. And so we want, we have this, there's a, there's a meta drive to bring about that

127
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,960
harmonic interplay. So you can call it sort of this vertical optimal gripping, if I can allow

128
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:14,000
that. And then we also have this meta drive of horizontal optimal gripping with the world

129
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,800
and other people. And the self is those two functions. And what Plato talks about is it's

130
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,960
possible to actually coordinate the satisfaction of those two functions. And I would put it to you

131
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,640
that it sounds to me like IFS is exactly a practice for coordinating them, because you're

132
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,480
trying to get the parts in this harmonious sense so that you can get a better grip on reality

133
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,080
thereby. Wonderful. That's exactly what I'm, when I'm thinking, there's so many things there

134
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:54,240
that I can, I can follow up on maybe. So I absolutely think it's about meta desires,

135
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,680
because, and I, and I would bring also in the good, the true and the beautiful, especially the good.

136
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Yeah, it's these two axes, right? The two are good and the beautiful are going both ways. Yes.

137
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,800
Because when you actually do parts work, and, and they, they get into this harmonic

138
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:22,160
self organization and self realization, is that now, at least it feels like they're committed to

139
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,120
something that they share, what parts share, and if this transcends their individual desires and

140
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,960
needs. So there are meta desires and meta needs. And I think that is to be deeply in contact with

141
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,600
reality. That's one aspect. And, and for, for this harmonic interplay to go on, because it's an

142
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,400
iterative game, right? So I, so, so the, the efficient, the resiliency is in this long term

143
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,200
efficiency. So not only for the sake of self maintenance and in an auto poetic sense. And,

144
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,960
and I think this makes it deeply human. And we should definitely talk about anthropology

145
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,800
as well. And this connects to my work in, in oncology, and also as in psychiatry,

146
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,280
because I think it's missing, we have deeply dehumanized anthropology going on. But

147
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,320
what I mean by, by, make us human is to not only to care for ourselves, but also to care for others.

148
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,840
I think that's, I think that's wonderful. So this, this, so Plato has a term, and you might

149
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,160
have heard me talk about it, the anagoge for, right? And, and, and so I, I think you're in

150
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,760
agreement, the self is kind of the anagoge function. It's these two meta desires, right,

151
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,840
coordinated together to bring about the reciprocal opening of the human being,

152
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,120
the flourishing with the world. And I think this connection is, I think, really, really

153
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:53,360
powerful. Because I think if we, if we agree that what Plato is proposing is something that

154
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,520
increases our inner peace, our connectedness to a reality, affords our capacity for self-transcendence,

155
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,080
cultivation of wisdom, we're not talking about something that can properly be called spiritual

156
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,640
without having to invoke any supernaturalism. And this, I think, and as I've had discussions

157
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,200
with people doing IFS, many of them want to sort of bring out the fact that IFS has this sort of

158
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,960
spiritual dimension to it. And I think that lines up with your wanting to bring in the mythos and

159
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:31,680
the imaginal. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Wow. Thank you, John. That's, you're exactly saying what I am,

160
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,880
what I was thinking. Thank you for watching. This YouTube and podcast series is by the

164
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
I want to propose something to you. And this is really something to do with your work. And,

165
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,680
and I hope I get your work right. And you can now see if I get your work right. And if not,

166
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,400
please correct me or add or compliment to it. Yeah, we'll work, we'll work through,

167
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,160
we'll work through anything that comes up together as friends. I want to compare you to Kant,

168
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,520
okay? So I want to see where both overlap. So the way I understand your work is,

169
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,960
and where I see you both in agreement, so Kant and Verveke, is that you both understand that

170
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,320
reality ultimately cannot be framed, right? So where I see you both differ is that what

171
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:44,240
reality ultimately is. Now whereas Kant sees reality as this thing outside of our cognitive

172
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,080
and rational faculties that uses frames and filters to make sense out of experiences,

173
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,040
which leads Kant to the conclusion, right, that we cannot have this access to the thing in itself,

174
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,920
this thing on sich, the Númena, and that we are ultimately trapped within our mind, I would propose

175
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:10,000
John Verveke would say that although our frames prevent us of grasping the whole reality,

176
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we can still participate in it, right? We nonetheless participate in reality via

177
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,440
these things like myth-making, mythos, mythopoieses, music, symbols, art, rituals, poetry, and all of

178
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,400
that. So I want to go on, if you just allow me, and this dance and this serious play between,

179
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,160
so basically the imaginal, what I wanted to say. So basically the dance and serious play between

180
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:49,120
the ultimate and the finite is a constant process of opening and closing. I would also say of homing

181
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,920
and adventuring, right? So getting back to your home, to your basis, but also, you know, leaving

182
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,400
this safe haven and also going to exploration, this meta assimilation, accommodation that you

183
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,600
talk about. And this leads me to following conclusion. And now let's see if you agree,

184
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,240
and because this brings, again, back in the idea of self. And where I see IFS overlap, but at the

185
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,440
same time also different, where I also have problems with it, obviously. So I would say

186
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,160
there is no soul beyond the body, that that's my first proposition. So there is no soul beyond the

187
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,560
body. So the self-organizing process of me being in the world, being in space and time, infuses

188
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,440
in nature, physical, right, is the soul. So the whole, the soul is that emergent thing out of the

189
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,520
body, the interaction of the body, but at the same time that that emanates back, right? So the

190
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,800
idea of emanation is important. So at this animating principle, the anima, the suke that we talk about.

191
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:04,480
And the second proposal is there is no self beyond otherness. That's what I would propose. So

192
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,720
meaning the self is this emergent thing out of the interactions of those parts. And again,

193
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,880
this is why I think dynamical systems theory is so important, also from a scientific perspective,

194
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,040
because it brings in this whole idea of myriology, this part's whole relationship.

195
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,680
Yes, yes. And one of the many. Yeah, exactly, one of many, exactly. So the self that is that which

196
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:39,200
homes otherness as spectrality, at the same time, it's the, you know, it's the parts and the otherness

197
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,160
that gives home to the self. So I mean, Kirkegaard has this, has this, what's the quote, the self is

198
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,680
a relation that relates itself to itself. So what I mean by relationship and process, and that's why

199
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,280
I would agree it's not a monadic thing is that the self isn't is a constant process. And I love the

200
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:04,640
idea that it's, that it's this two axis kind of thing that you mentioned, those two dimensions,

201
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,400
the inner conflict, the resolution of inner conflict, as well as

202
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
getting into contact with reality. Now, the third one, when I what I want to propose is that

203
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:22,160
there was no, no thing, not a thing, no thing beyond the spirit of intelligibility. So beyond,

204
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,360
in other words, beyond this organizing principle, the God beyond, beyond God's that you're talking

205
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,960
about. And so, and I think this is what, what Jung would call the anima mundi or the uns mundos,

206
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,560
and I think this is similar to the idea of self. So I think it's Jung is not talking about this.

207
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I mean, there are parts we're talking about this monadic self, but I assume he, I think he assumes

208
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,080
something different when he talks about self, and it becomes clear when he talks about the mandala,

209
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,000
like this four dimensions. To me, they are similar to those four dimensions of meaning-making,

210
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,960
the nomological, the normative, and the narrative, as well as the connectedness. So,

211
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,560
yeah, not to intellectualize too much now, but what I was trying to refer to is that

212
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,640
in IFS, you often talk about the self as the part that is not a part. And to me, this

213
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,960
eludes a lot, or there sounds very similar to the God that is not a God, or the God beyond God,

214
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,120
the religion that is not a religion, so that it doesn't have this thinness to it.

215
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,520
Yeah. What do you think? Well, that was incredibly rich. Yeah. Okay. So I'll try and trace through

216
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:45,200
some of this. I think, yeah, what you said about my relationship to Kant is amazing. I take, of

217
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,760
course, from Kant, the idea of framing, and then that's what the relevance realization,

218
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,440
but unlike Kant, I don't think the mind is the author of framing. I think the mind participates

219
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,960
with the world in framing. So I would add that E, right? There's in framing going on,

220
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,880
relevance is something co-created by the world and the mind. And that's what makes me fundamentally

221
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,880
different from Kant and makes me a plateness, because I believe in this sense of participation.

222
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,680
So I think if that lands back with you well, I think we understand each other very well. You

223
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,800
understand me very well. I think that's true. Yes. I even think I understand why you think that

224
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,680
that is. And I think it's because of those bioeconomic constraints that we have. I mean,

225
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,920
it has to be to make, so that we can give an account of evolution as well. So we have to

226
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,400
participate in being in contact somehow with reality. So it wouldn't make sense with evolutionary

227
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:51,600
theory in a deep sense. And it also means that we can sidestep a lot of significant contradictions

228
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,240
in Kant. Kant denies, because the mind does, in his view, mind frames only in terms that are

229
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,960
relative to human experience. We can have no knowledge of God. But as other people pointed

230
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
out almost immediately, that same argument applies completely to the thing in itself,

231
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,760
which means Kant becomes a kind of Berkeley and idealist, and he resisted that. And I don't want

232
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:26,560
to get into the technicalities. But I think you very much have caught the deep gist of what I'm

233
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,880
saying. Thank you. That's important to me, John, because I think in this way, I understand you

234
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,240
better. I think if I speak your language, we can communicate better. So that's why it was

235
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,360
important for me to get your feedback on that. I appreciate that. Now, I want to thank you.

236
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
Sorry, this may come off as arrogant. I don't mean it to you. It's just because of my

237
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,960
particular education. It's usually me trying to reach the language of the person I'm talking to.

238
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Yes, I get that. And so I really appreciate this. The idea that I think there's two

239
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:12,960
ideas. Your first two proposals about the soul, I put them together. I think they belong together

240
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,520
in the claim that the self is not substantial. The self is not a substance. The self is not an

241
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,520
independently existing thing. We give up that Aristotelian model that the self is a substance.

242
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,040
And I think a standard model of the soul, not all models of the soul in all versions of Christianity

243
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:37,040
by any means or in Islam or anything like that. But many central models of the soul is that it is

244
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:44,800
a substance. It is a standalone thing to which all properties and relations and actions belong.

245
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:52,080
And I think that is fundamentally misplaced. I think it is to get things exactly the wrong

246
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,480
way around. I think this goes to what you were saying about no-thingness and other things. I

247
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:07,440
think the relationality, the intelligibility is primary and that relata emerge out of that

248
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,960
relational field. And this maps very well to the bottom of our physics and the top of our physics.

249
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,800
And so I'm not saying anything really bizarre or weird. And I won't go into that argument,

250
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:27,760
but I am totally in agreement. And therefore, understanding the self as inherently dialogical

251
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,160
as self and other bound together. And I think of it as there being a deep continuity. I think

252
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,280
John Verweyke is a distributed cognition of the collective intelligence of parts of his brain

253
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:50,240
all the way down to sorgans and systems and cells. And I think John Verweyke is part of systems of

254
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,720
distributed cognition and collective intelligence that make up various cultural

255
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,840
environments and historical environments that he's operating in. And I think there's deep

256
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:08,640
continuity down and up. And I think that means the self is inherently non-substantial. So it's

257
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:16,000
not a thing. If by thing we mean a bounded, basiotemporal, independently existing thing.

258
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,960
And I think there is this deep continuity down into the depths of our body and up to the heights

259
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,200
of our spirit, because that's what we're actually talking about here. And in that sense, it is a

260
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,800
body double. And I agree with that, right? It's sort of, it's bound to the body in this and our

261
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:45,200
embodiment in a very powerful way. And then this idea that we, like the cosmos, are enmeshed in

262
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,920
the issue of the one in the mini, the emergence and the emanation. I think that is correct. And I

263
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,400
think that's a profound example of participatory knowing. It's not that we know the one in the

264
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,880
mini. We are the one in the mini. We know it by participating in its very principle and processes.

265
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,240
Of course, the content of your cognition and mine are different, but they share this same

266
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:18,000
fundamental grammar and we share it together with reality. And I think that is a deep, deeply

267
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,240
important thing. And so I like the final proposal. I'm coming to your final proposal and then I'll

268
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,600
shut up, which is there's something. Thank you. There's something in us that is like the neoplatonic

269
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,080
one. There is something in us that is that participates, but, but it is not a part because

270
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,920
it is the very principle of participation itself. And there is something in reality that is no kind

271
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:47,680
of thing. It is the very principle of thingness, right? That of things emerging, of them being

272
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,920
intelligible, of them entering into relationships with each other. And so I do think they're,

273
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,760
and Proclas talked about this. There is the one within us that participates in the one without us,

274
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,320
but of course they are ultimately just in some important and very hard to articulate sense one.

275
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:14,160
And so I like that proposal. I like the proposal. Turning young, young into more of a neoplatness

276
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,840
would be, I think, a wonderful thing to do. He's very platonic. I often call him the plate

277
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,800
of the psyche. His notion of archetypes is just the notion of the forms, right? And so I think all

278
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,040
of this deeply resonates. I hope I've done it justice in my reply to all of your proposals.

279
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
Thank you, John. That's wonderful. And especially the last part that reminded me of

280
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:45,280
we being the one that reminded me, I mean, that's such a platonic idea.

281
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,320
So I want to circle back to the meaning crisis with that. I'm really grateful for

282
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,880
you bringing back also this Persian heritage into the meaning crisis. I'm an Iranian.

283
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm Persian. And so first of all, thank you for that. Well, my partner, my partner, who is

284
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:23,520
the profound beloved love of my life, is Persian. I didn't know that. Okay, that hits my heart.

285
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,960
She's easily one of the best people I have met in my entire life.

286
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,120
Yeah, I believe that.

287
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,600
And what you said with the one, we being the one, this reminded me

288
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:52,640
of a Persian myth by one of those Persian mystics and Sufis,

289
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,280
Attar. I think he's one of the teachers of Rumi, if I'm not mistaken.

290
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,360
The name is familiar to me. I'm learning a lot about the Sufi heritage right now.

291
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,040
And there is this philosophical Silk Road. Yeah, it's so interesting. And there is this

292
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:17,120
mythological being. It's called Seymour. Seymour is actually the spirit of intelligibility.

293
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,800
I didn't know this. Say this again. How would I spell that?

294
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:32,720
So S-I-M-O-R-G-H. Okay. The spirit of intelligibility. That's amazing.

295
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,640
Yes. And Attar had this idea that, I think it's the conference of the birds, I think it's called.

296
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,120
If I'm not mistaken. Parliament of the birds, I think I've heard of the birds ones.

297
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,800
There are like thousands of birds that fly to find Seymour. And they have to go through seven

298
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:00,880
valleys. And that's one is the valley of self-deception, one is the valley of detachment,

299
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,640
and all those things. And ultimately, what happens is that out of those thousand birds,

300
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,680
only 30 survive and they get there. But they don't find Seymour. They don't find this thing,

301
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,480
this big bird, this mythological creature. They understand that they are Seymour. And you know

302
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,440
what Seymour means in Persian is C means 30 and more means bird. So 30 birds, they survive and

303
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,600
they realize they are actually the one. Yes. Yes. So that reminded me totally of that.

304
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,440
I got to get this. I've heard of this and I've never read it, but I'm going to order it once

305
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,280
we're done speaking because I've got to read this. This is wonderful mythos. So this brings us into

306
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,600
that by which, and this is where Kant struggles, in fact, and where I'm trying to be very much

307
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:01,920
more influenced by Corban. Yes. Ibn Arabi, Corban, in some ways sort of already the imaginal as that

308
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:08,240
which bridges between the one and the mini and the inner and the outer. And it's not the imaginary.

309
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,120
We don't look at these images. They are like icons. We look through them like the way I'm

310
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,080
looking through my glasses. But it is also the way in which the world can reach back through them

311
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:28,880
into us. It is not that way. It's both ways. It is in a sense. Go ahead. It's so wonderful that

312
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,800
you invoke this idea. And I think this is so important to understand that the imaginal is,

313
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,520
again, not a thing. And that's why we think imaginary or imagination or imaginal is not

314
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,440
something real, but it is deeply real because it has this power. It's something like a catalyst.

315
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,000
And I learned this also when you look at, and that's why I love coming from the place of children

316
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,320
and adolescents as a psychotherapist for children and adolescents and working and researching on

317
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,080
them. You learn so many things. And again, this is also what I want to add to IFS and to this whole

318
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,080
ecology of awakening to meaning and all of that because you can learn so many things from them.

319
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:21,520
I mean, Rodgers, Carl Rodgers, he was a school counselor, guidance guide. And you learned

320
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:30,240
so well from developmental psychologists. Like when you take Piaget or other development psychologists

321
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,440
Mahler or even Winnicott, when you have this kid, let's say it's two or three years old,

322
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,600
right? And it has to learn this normative developmental task of separation, the modern infant

323
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:48,960
separation. And in psychoanalytic theory, you would call, what it needs to is it has to have this,

324
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:56,480
how would they call this object, like the doll?

325
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,720
There's the, it's a transitional object.

326
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,840
Transitional object, exactly. They have the transitional objects. I only had the German name

327
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:13,600
for it. And it's a serious play. It's a catalyst. It's this imaginal thing that they involved in

328
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:20,000
so that they can understand. And I think this is where it comes together, is that how can I have

329
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,760
my mother's love, while at the same time, be able to differentiate, right? So you bring in

330
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,480
the spirit of the mother of the caregiver, into this liminal space, and I would say into the

331
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,840
playground, when we talk about this, when we talk about this play. And Winnicott would too.

332
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:47,200
Yes, exactly. And I would, and this is where I would want to add Vygotsky to, right? Yes.

333
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,600
Yeah. I love what you're doing here. You're bringing Vygotsky and Winnicott together

334
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,320
with the imaginal. Please go, go on. Yes. And I think it's so important because

335
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,880
what it does is that the doll or the transitional object that I'm playing with, what I do is I

336
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:11,120
immerse into, into something that, that catches me, that is outside of my faculties. At the same

337
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,880
time, it's in me and it grips me. And I think where Vygotsky comes in is that

338
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,680
it's, it's this, the zone of proximal development. I think where we really transform and develop

339
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:30,960
is this imaginal space, because it is between this overload and the under load. It's between

340
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,200
the infinite and the finite. And that's why I think it's into essay, right? So it's my interest

341
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,600
that guides me, that guides me into this imaginal, liminal space where I can, where I can have,

342
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,040
you know, have the cake and eat it too, right? So I have the spirit of the caregiver at the same

343
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,080
time I have the spirit of individuation. And this only can happen when I have this catalyst,

344
00:37:54,080 --> 00:38:00,480
this, in this sense, transitional object or the serious play. And I think interest is such a

345
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,400
wonderful marker. And what happens is that there's so interesting research, I'm sure you know about,

346
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,280
about private speech, right? So when you, and I think, again, this is where IFS comes into play.

347
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,800
It's this dialogical practice. Now, what, what developmental psychologists

348
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:24,320
talk about when you talk about private speech or self talk is that you can observe this behavior.

349
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,680
A kid is in exactly in this liminal or, or imaginal space or in the zone of proximal

350
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:39,360
development when it starts to talk to itself, but not internally, they talk loudly to themselves.

351
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,440
Yes. Yes. They

352
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,160
have to talk aloud to

353
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,320
exactly. And what I think what happens is that we, we, we, we, we complexify, we

354
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,560
particularly raise, we individual way, no, sorry, not individual but

355
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,800
individual in a sense, but you know, differentiate in a sense. And what we do is then by this,

356
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,600
we learn how to internalize those voices, let's say of the caregiver or the parent,

357
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,640
and then we talk to ourselves. And I think this aspect of dialogical self is so important.

358
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,480
And this is actually where development happens. And I think IFS, and I would say now two things

359
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:30,800
about this. In one sense, IFS helps us through this inner dialogical self process. At the same

360
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,160
time, I think IFS can still also learn from the practice of children and adolescents and enhance

361
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,320
its own methodology. And that's why I think it's so important to bring in back those aspects of

362
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,640
of childhood and adolescence too. So yeah, I'm sorry, I shut up now. So what do you do?

363
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was beautiful. First of all, I'm going to have to

364
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,720
remember to cite you on this, this bridging between you made between the imaginal and then

365
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,200
transitional object and Winnecott, and then integrating that with Bogotsky. And of course,

366
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,560
when the child starts to talk to themselves, that's how they develop metacognition,

367
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,520
exactly essential for essential for rationality. And I think that and for self direction,

368
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,680
long term planning, all of that stuff, even sense of self is modified significantly.

369
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,400
I think that's right. I think the fact that I have a book, I haven't read it yet,

370
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,440
a person looking at self talk. That's another name for the private speech, right? And the

371
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,480
fact that we devote so much time for it means it probably has some very powerful adaptive

372
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,240
functionality. And yet we don't investigate it. We treat it as noise or silliness or some bad habit.

373
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,840
This is because we're bound up to the buffered self that Charles Taylor's talked about. We're

374
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,440
bound to the monadic self. We don't realize, no, no, talking to yourself is like, you will kind

375
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,880
of go insane if you don't do that. I imagine there might be some people who transcend to a

376
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,720
witness consciousness. But I think of Castaway and I think of Wilson and how powerful Wilson

377
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:15,280
became, right? And the profound grief, a spoiler, by the way, the profound grief that

378
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,320
Tom Hanks's character has when he loses Wilson. And I think all of that is just

379
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,400
so pregnant with something that is deeply culturally relevant, significant, pertinent to

380
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,360
addressing the meaning crisis. Because I'll just make a quick proposal to you. I think part of

381
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:45,200
what drives the meaning crisis is this notion of the monadic self, the single static substance

382
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,240
self. And because that drives us into a kind of nominalism, it drives us into a radical

383
00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:00,000
self other adversarial kind of processing. It's an important driver. And it makes us resistant

384
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,560
to alternative states of consciousness, because they are seen merely as deviants from the true

385
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:12,640
self or something like that. And so I think I'm proposing to you that I think IFS and related

386
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,560
practices, you know, there's, you know, empty chair therapy. Yes. There's ally work. And I'm

387
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,440
talking a lot with Barnaby about this, right? I think all of these things are attempts to both

388
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,880
bottom up from practice, real transformative practice and top down from theory, provide us with

389
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,160
a significant and rich alternative to the monadic self. I absolutely agree. I think this whole idea

390
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:47,600
of monad is difficult. Because I think it's also bound to this idea of having and being in the

391
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,640
having. Oh, yes. And I think this is much about, yeah, it's modal confusion all the way through.

392
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:00,720
It's modal confusion. And this and being trapped in the having mode, I think is one of the most

393
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,880
important drivers of the meaning crisis. And again, now we can circle back to what I, how I, you know,

394
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:17,440
in my own biography, saw how not only the the bad place that we are in, but also how IFS played

395
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,240
in into this. So, and again, I think there are two ways now to where we can connect to the

396
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,800
meaning crisis again. And one is via the mental health crisis in adolescence and the in the

397
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,120
meaning crisis in adolescence. And we can talk about this in a second. And the other one is,

398
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,520
again, this missing anthropology that I see in modern human science, and to related fields like

399
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,040
medicine, psychiatry and psychotherapy, etc. And I think it's devastatingly contributing to the

400
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,840
meaning crisis. And I saw this. And again, I see this in practice. And also in my research,

401
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,960
and because there we have these deep problems with the current notions and our theoretical

402
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:09,200
notions of of psychopathology, that's one, but also as well with this evidence based translation

403
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,720
into into treatment. And, and there are several reasons that we can, you know, have have a whole,

404
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,400
you know, podcast on this alone, but they're like, understanding illness is something

405
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,440
as symptom aggregates, which is, you know, a deception or, again, the ignorance of non-urgidicity,

406
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,600
right? So independent, assuming independent events, then committing ecological fallacies,

407
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:43,120
right? The generalizability to individual problem. There are like deviation from protocols. If you

408
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,600
if you deviate from the protocol, which is actually only protocol for randomized control trial,

409
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,040
then it's, it's not, you know, it's bad practice or pseudoscience. And there, there are plethora

410
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,600
of problems, which I again, I would say it's a lack of proposition and non propositional knowing.

411
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,720
So by reducing, again, I'm not, I'm not saying or advocating that evidence based is wrong or

412
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,840
bad. I want to be clear about this. I think evidence. Yeah, I get and you get that. I think we

413
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:16,560
have to go beyond this notion of non propositional, of propositional and bring back all those other

414
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,080
piece you talk about into this. And this is where I really see this landscape that it's missing. And

415
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:28,080
it's, and it's, it is deeply problematic because we have this dehumanized anthropology. And

416
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:35,840
it's so interesting. Roland May talks about this and the discovery of being, he actually,

417
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:42,320
he points to the behavior modification therapies. And by training, I am a behavioral therapist.

418
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,240
So I have deep sympathy for that. I think there was a lot of wisdom in it, because there is,

419
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,120
it's embodied, you do things, you experience things. So, but what he wonderfully points out is that

420
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:58,560
especially in those types, we have this, we have this missing anthropology, we actually don't have

421
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,400
a conception of men, of human beings. So, and I think this is deeply, deeply difficult. And now,

422
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,360
I don't know if you know this, John, but what happens right now in the field of bioethics is

423
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:15,920
that there is a return to phenomenology, actually. Oh, that's good news. That's really, really

424
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,560
interesting. There is this philosopher. He's called Frederick Sveneos. He's a, he's Swedish.

425
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,160
And he has this book, even it's called Phenomenological Bioethics. And it's so interesting,

426
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,560
because there are several scholars and people in this academic field that argue now for even a

427
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,920
definition of illness, being defined as a meaning crisis, as a crisis. Oh, wow. Yes. And that's so

428
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,320
interesting. It's even called illness as, and now listen to the language as an unhome-like being in

429
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:57,360
the world. DSEs, like going back to the etymology of the original word. Yes. So, fortunately,

430
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,240
this happens. But I think all those technological advancements, and we know this, you talk about

431
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:10,800
this all the time, that they, the technological changes happen before the meaning crisis and

432
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,160
et cetera. So there is this whole disenchantment that runs through this modernity, also runs through

433
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,640
medicine and psychotherapy, et cetera. So I think this is what I'm really concerned about. And again,

434
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:30,960
meaning is, so what we can, the lesson that we can get out of is that meaning is not an epiphenomenon.

435
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,600
It's not easily dispensed with. It's crucial. It's necessary, even from a bioethical standpoint,

436
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:44,960
right? And again, because we're more than just a sum of, you know, cogs and gear wheels and

437
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,080
this mechanistic, reductionistic thing. And now there's Thomas Fuchs. He's actually a professor

438
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:58,320
of phenomenological psychiatry. He has this Carl Yaspas. He's a professor for Carl Yaspas in

439
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,880
Heidelberg, I think. He makes this. Oh, I love. Yeah, he makes this wonderful point that medicine

440
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,480
is actually a relational medicine is relational. It's a relational, I don't know what to call

441
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:18,320
science, but a practice. It's a relational practice. So. Wow. Who is that second person? Does he have

442
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:26,880
a book or Thomas Fuchs? He has lots of books. Oh, I think he even has one in English. He publishes

443
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,320
a lot in German, but there is one. I will forward it to you or I can look it up in a second. Thomas

444
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:39,360
Fuchs. Really interesting. I had the privilege to talk to him once in a conference. So, yeah,

445
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:46,080
it's, I mean, it is there, but it's still concerning. And so to me, to me, it was, again,

446
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:52,000
by gravity to link my work to the meaning crisis and to IFS is that to me, it was clear from the

447
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,160
get go from the beginning that we're not only in a funerary predicament, but also in the spiritual

448
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,080
one. And yeah, obviously due to our affinity and it's related to that, but there is this deep

449
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:09,120
spiritual deprivation that we have. And you see this when you work. I mean, I worked in oncology.

450
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,000
Meaning is really, really important. And even the evidence based practice,

451
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:20,240
you have meaning centered psychotherapy that is actually you have efficacy right there. So it's

452
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:28,080
actually Victor Frankl's logotherapy revisited and done for oncology. It's done by Breitbart,

453
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,920
his called, he's a wonderful researcher. And it's getting there. And again, working with adolescence

454
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,720
and especially those auto line types and in this crisis center that I'm working with is that

455
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,800
it's so salient. It's so present. And it's so

456
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:52,640
obvious that we are lacking this how we meet a person. And, and IFS helps me there to to again to

457
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,520
meet and not to reduce it to some, I mean, obviously a model is always prone to reductionism, and I

458
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:06,640
can reduce you to your protectors or managers or exiles to, but it helps me if done correctly again,

459
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:13,920
I think it helps me to, to connect to the human being again. And, and this is where I see IFS

460
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,240
helping because John, ultimately what I think, and let's see what do you think about this?

461
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,040
I'm sorry, if I'm talking that much. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're great. Keep going.

462
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,360
Ultimately, what I see what is happening is that

463
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:36,480
this momentum of healing in especially experience in IFS, but I think it goes beyond IFS. I

464
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,560
think IFS is just the proxy. It's a placeholder for what is happening is there.

465
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:50,480
What happens is that agape heals. I see it as a deep agape love that happens. And I see this

466
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,680
in therapy interpersonally, right, this, this, this horizontal axis you're talking about. But I

467
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:04,960
also see it in the, within the model itself in those, in this, in those technical steps

468
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,680
you do, especially for example, you talk about the Socratic shift, right. And, and I want to propose

469
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,560
that before we do the Socratic shift, we need the process of validation. I can't get you to change

470
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,720
and to into the state of a poria. I mean, I could, but it's only, maybe it's not long lasting,

471
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:31,760
I get back into this attractive state after a while. But if I really am with a part, I am with

472
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,960
a partner, it's like being with a part, right? It's like I validate you. Validating means that

473
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,680
you are valid. Your whole reason, your raison d'être, the reason of being, it's, it's valid. You,

474
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,680
you have a reason to be there. You're functioning, you're, you're framing whatever you do. It's,

475
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,480
it's so important that you get acknowledged because what I think, I think I want to propose

476
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,600
to you, John, that we do the Socratic shift a little bit later. So before we do the Socratic

477
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:08,640
shift, we validate, because if we don't do this, we get into again, the having mode, and then it's

478
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:17,360
again the court, not the courtyard, but the courtroom of debate. It's not the courtyard of, of the

479
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:25,680
dialogue, but it's the courtroom of debate. Because if I just spill this over you, and I, and I, and I,

480
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,160
it's, it's, well, well, let me reply. Yes, yes, please. Okay. So first of all,

481
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,800
to your point, a couple minutes past that, you know, propositional tyranny has infected medicine,

482
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,560
and we've lost, we've lost touch with the non propositional knowing, and that's where a lot of

483
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:52,640
the meaning participation occurs. And the meaning participation is a fundamental being together,

484
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,000
being with, and that's part of what participatory knowing is, knowing by being with.

485
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,200
Exactly. And so all of that, I think, I think that tracks very well. It goes to the work I'm

486
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:11,280
doing with Terry Dentry about trying to open up what we mean by health and, and, and medicine.

487
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,680
And so I'm completely constant with that. I think the thing you're, you're saying right now, I, I take,

488
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:25,280
I mean, it is, it is exemplary constructive criticism. I think you're right. I, and this goes

489
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:29,680
to what Seth Allison was talking about, where, where you're talking about Agapa, he talks about

490
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,640
integrating attachment theory and IFS, and you actually have attachment relationships with

491
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,800
your parts. And you have to bring in sort of EFT, Emotion Focus Therapy kind of techniques

492
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,120
to get into proper relation. And then I said to him, once you're doing that, what I've done,

493
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,640
though, is I've also brought, and maybe this is the bridging, I sort of bring some of the

494
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,520
Socratic into my interaction with my parts, because I try to get them to recognize their

495
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:59,920
function. I try to recognize, get them to, I try to enhance their own self-awareness and their own,

496
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,520
therefore, responsibility to themselves. So they go from just enacting their functionality to

497
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:13,280
reflecting on it, which also opens up spaces of possibility for them, which I think is.

498
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:18,000
And that's great. I learned that actually from you. And I, and I actually,

499
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,440
now I'm trying to incorporate it more into my practice. I love this Socratic move and shift.

500
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,560
Actually, when you, when you said that in, I think it was episode eight in, in, after Socrates,

501
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:35,280
it's like, whoa, yeah, I've never done this, you know, do the Socratic shift on the part. It's like,

502
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:42,000
wow. Yeah. But I think that you and Seth are correct that it's premature to do that unless the

503
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:48,800
attachment issues and the, and the, and the, and the reciprocal recognition has taken place. The

504
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:55,440
being with has to be in place, right? In order to shift you out of the having mode, in order to open

505
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,320
you up for the real possibility of genuine Socratic practice, as opposed to just using or having a

506
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,720
Socratic technique, that's how I would put it. And I think you are exactly right about that.

507
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,360
And I've been trying to incorporate that in to my practice, and we are going to try and see how we

508
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:17,680
can feed this in. We see the problem the Verveke Foundation faces is we, we, one of our stead

509
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:24,160
past principles is we are not offering therapy because we are not properly vetted or certified

510
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,440
to do that. We have, we have affiliate relationships with therapists who can come in if people

511
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,680
hit crisis or distress, but we, our practices are not therapy and trying to figure out how to get

512
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,760
that what you just said, which I agree. Do you see the problem we're struggling with? Absolutely.

513
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,680
Right. It's like what you said, I think is deeply right, but we will not offer therapy

514
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:52,160
for principled reasons, right? I think then genuine bioethical reasons, we will not do that. And so

515
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,120
there's a struggle here. And maybe, you know, off-camera, you know, you and Chris and Taylor

516
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:04,560
and I could talk about maybe a way of doing this that could, could pick up on, I think, the very

517
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:10,000
legitimate point you just made while still respecting our ethical requirements of not

518
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:16,400
engaging in therapy. And can I add to that? I want to compliment you for that. I think

519
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,080
it is actually, even from, from the ethos, it's the right or the tell us, it's the right move.

520
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,200
I think, and this is again, the problem that I have and that I was trying to allude to when I,

521
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,800
when I talk about evidence-based practices in psychotherapy, I think it's, it's, it's a fatal

522
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,440
mistake. And again, contributing to the meaning crisis, if we pathologize everything, not everything

523
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,400
has to be a psychotherapeutic modality and intervention or technique. Now, obviously,

524
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,560
it can inform our practices, but I, but for it to be pathological, I think it's way more important.

525
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,400
So I think therapy can help there, the techniques. And to be fair, the Socratic move that I'm

526
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,760
proposing, IFS accounts for it. Now, this is when you do the integration, what you do when you talk

527
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,720
to the exile, for example, and then you have this unburdening, and now we don't have to go into the

528
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,320
details right now, but you invite back the protector. And now you do do Socratic move,

529
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:20,080
now you hopefully do the aporian. And you say, now how can you contribute to the,

530
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,840
to the state after the alleviation of pain and suffering, after the unburdening? Now, again,

531
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:30,640
I still think that you're right. And I think, and I, and I love that you're doing the pathological

532
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:39,920
work because again, I think it's, I'm, I'm actually really afraid of the fact that we,

533
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,080
that we are pathologizing everything, especially when it comes to adolescence. And

534
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,360
you know, we talked about the archetype of the adolescent, and we should talk about this maybe

535
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:57,440
another time, but it's the idiosyncrasies of, of adolescents are so important and crucial.

536
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,880
And we tend to, I mean, not only with regards to adolescents, we tend to pathologize a lot of

537
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:10,320
things. So I'm deeply grateful for the work of the Viveki Foundation, but not just, you know, being

538
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,600
psychoterapeutical, but it's more pathological. I think it's a wonderful and noble thing to do, John.

539
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:26,160
Thank you. But and you, of course, are coming back because I do want to talk about the archetype

540
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,840
of the adolescent and how it fits. I can talk about everything for like, or anything for like hours

541
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,320
with you. Well, honestly, I think talking with you and having other people hear what you have to

542
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:47,280
say, I think is extremely valuable. Yeah, I mean, so I just, yeah, I do want to pick your brain

543
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,480
and your colleagues about that particular problem. I, we don't, I'm not asking us to solve it here,

544
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,560
and this is not the right place to try and solve it. But I do think, you know, there's a way of,

545
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:02,240
I want to recognize, I want to recognize and be responsible to the truth you've articulated,

546
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,880
while still, still being governed by the principle, the ethical principle that I've

547
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,440
articulated. And that's a tricky thing to do. And trying to figure out how to do that is

548
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,520
something I'd like to talk about. Yeah, it's a dance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's,

549
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:24,160
it's a very careful dance. I want to, I want to bring back a little bit about, because you've,

550
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,160
you've said it a few times and it's deeply, deeply impactful to me. And we had to talk about other

551
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,720
things. I wasn't able to pick it up, but I want to pick it up now. Yes. So you've often invoked,

552
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:41,280
you know, and I think the self is metaxu. This is the ancient Greek word for between. I think the

553
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:48,960
self, well, I should be careful. This is Highland's interpretation of what the, the central argument

554
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,560
of Plato was, which is we are the relationship between finitude and ultimacy, between finitude

555
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:02,080
and transcendence. And if we, if we try to identify with either one of the poles, and if we lose the

556
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,200
polarity and try to identify with either one of the poles, we either fall into cert, into

557
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:15,840
servile despair, or we, we go through inflationary hubris and spirituality in the, in the proper

558
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,520
sense, in the, or at least sorry, that was inappropriate. Spirituality in the Platonic

559
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:30,800
sense that would be proper to Plato's framework is that we enable, we induce and educate, we draw

560
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:36,880
out and we also transform people so that they are capable of holding that tonus, that creative

561
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,520
tension between that, like a profound opponent processing that gives them the most profound

562
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:49,920
optimal grip on their fundamental orientation reality is you have to get this opponent processing

563
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:58,240
between your finitude and your transcendence, right, between, right, how you are as a, as a single

564
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,800
being and the relationship you have to ultimacy, but that you are that tonus. You're like the

565
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:11,040
tension of the bow as Heraclitus talks about the logos of the, of the psyche, right? And that,

566
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,520
and that, that is kind of the deepest, most profound opponent processing and that is the

567
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,520
source of our deepest, most profound optimal gripping, our most profound orientation.

568
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:27,120
And I want, I want to know it because you've invoked the, that, those, that pair multiple

569
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:34,080
times in our conversation. How does that proposal land to you that that's a deep thing? I'm about

570
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,520
to teach a course for the Reveki Foundation on literature and the meaning crisis and wrestling

571
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,680
with these books in which you see human beings wrestling with the meaning crisis and it's

572
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:51,920
precisely the way the meaning crisis throws this tonus into WAP and either drives people into despair

573
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,920
or drives them into inflation. The heart of darkness is a, is a classic example or Moby Dick,

574
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,880
right? Do you think, sorry, this was a long preamble, but I hope it's landing. Do you think that

575
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:13,200
IFS, especially because it's doing the imaginal, it's getting us related to the transitional

576
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:19,600
object, it's moving us out of the matter itself, getting us to inhabit and be a Metaxu, a pure,

577
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:26,640
a purely relational being in the deep relation to relationality, which is ultimate. Do you think

578
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:34,720
IFS in there for can help us with this fundamental commitment to our true humanity, which is the

579
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:41,280
tonus, the creative tension, the opponent processing between finitude and transcendence? Do you think

580
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:50,720
that is that just too far afield or is it a good situation? Because to me, it seems that a big part

581
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:57,360
of the meaning crisis is the way we lose the polarity and we get attracted to either one of

582
01:02:57,360 --> 01:03:03,840
these poles in either nihilism or narcissism and they're not opposites. They are two sides of the

583
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:12,320
same coin. Yes. Wow, what a question. I hope I can be fair to this question because obviously I'm

584
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:20,400
not, I cannot speak for the whole IFS community, but only from my perspective of it. But I think IFS

585
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,800
has the potential to do so. Now, again, with the monad, I think, or the having mode, I don't think

586
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:33,360
it's the panacea. You said it yourself. It cannot be a panacea. It has to be embedded in an ecology,

587
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,440
and no matter what method, technique, paradigm, whatever you want to use,

588
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:51,680
there are ways to do it good or better and worse. So I think it has the potential to do so.

589
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,080
And I think if IFS is done properly with this whole sapiential framework around it,

590
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:07,440
then I think it's so powerful. But I've also seen people, again, being trapped in the having mode

591
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:14,480
at the same time using IFS and do the spiritual bypassing. So I think it's a matter of, it's the

592
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:22,960
how-ness, how we do things that matters more than the what-ness, right? Well, you know, that's a

593
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:30,080
standard definition, or at least the distinction between knowledge, which is a what, and wisdom is

594
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:40,640
the how. Yeah. So again, to be, yeah, I think if done properly, it has, because I think of this

595
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:47,200
essentially agopic element to it. And I really think, and this is what I see happening in therapy,

596
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:57,600
John, there is this magical moment happening if you, and I'm at, in this time, I'm really proud

597
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:04,080
to be part of it, to participate in it. When you, when, and I'm, and I think I'm privileged to witness

598
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:11,360
healing at times. Now, and this is so interesting, I don't consider myself as, as the one that

599
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:19,520
heals. I only participate in it. And it's so interesting because Plato has this critique of

600
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:30,560
therapy, a theon, and anything, because it relates to this, to God, right, to theon. And, but, but

601
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:37,600
therapy, a theon, I think it's, if you properly do it, what therapy means, or theon means, or

602
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:44,400
therapy means in this case is that, in its deep sense, etymologically, is it's your certain,

603
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,760
your servant of God. Now, I think what happens in those moments in the therapy room is when

604
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,800
you witness healing is that you are part of something bigger, what you're relating to. And,

605
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,640
and, and it's a beautiful thing that happens. And that's why there, you can invoke the

606
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,440
anesthesis, right, the, the perception, the aesthetics, these, and that's why I think that

607
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:13,600
beauty is the, as the primary thing is absolutely correct. It has this beautiful, elegant thing

608
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:20,480
to it. And, and, and what IFAS brings here is this moment of not only of logos, where the good,

609
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,240
the true, and the beautiful, I think where, where they are one is actually the logos, I think in

610
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,800
meaning is where the good, the true, and the beautiful are actually, you cannot, they're not

611
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,760
the same thing, but at the same time, you cannot, you know, they're not separated, right? And, and,

612
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,920
and, and this, this wonderful, you said that IFAS is platonic and Jungian, I would also say it's

613
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:49,920
Augustinian, in the sense that it's, it's agape, right? This moment of love that's happening is

614
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:57,760
what transcends both. And this is what Jung also referred to is that when it's, or Rogers too,

615
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,240
in the sense that when, when good, when you need a soul, there is this potential transformation

616
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,360
for both of them. And I often have this, have this feeling that when I go out, you know, when I

617
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:16,480
have my session, when they're done, I am changed myself. Yeah. Yeah. So I hope I was fair to your,

618
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:23,600
to your question. You're more than fair. You brought, I really, really enjoy talking with you.

619
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:30,560
This is really just catching fire. Thanks for me. So I thought, thought what you said was great.

620
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,320
We're, we're coming to a close. I'd like to bring up one question. And then I want to,

621
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,520
but first I want to propose what we could talk about next time. First of all, I think I want to

622
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,440
give you space and time to talk about the archetype of the adolescent. I think that's

623
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,880
important. Yeah, that will be, and I think that, I think it's essential. Yeah, necessary, especially

624
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,480
for the mental health crisis, especially for the meeting crisis. I think, I think you're

625
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,160
bang on about that. The second thing I want to talk to you about is now that we broached,

626
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:03,280
you invoked Agape, you invoked the possibility of something bigger and God, the logos. I mean,

627
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:08,240
this has to do, and there's also Jung, and you know, the red book, and he has Philemon, and he has

628
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:13,840
these, these, these, these, you know what I'm talking about, and there's no good name for them. I

629
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:19,280
mean, Ralph calls them allies. And of course, I've had this experience, and I've been doing ally work,

630
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:24,640
and I'd like to hear, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not expecting you to be an expert on this or anything.

631
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:30,480
I just want your reflections from an IFS. I've been asking Seth Allison about this and other people

632
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,440
about this. And we, so if we could talk about those two things, we'll talk about the, the, well,

633
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,920
that we got a triple A here, the archetype of the adolescent and the ally. If we could talk about

634
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,920
that next time, I would appreciate that. That would be great. Okay. And so thank you for that.

635
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,360
Thank you. And what I'd like to talk to you about right now is our final point. And it, it's a

636
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:58,720
Socratic point, which means I hope it comes off as constructive. So I think all of, all of this is

637
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:07,200
very, very well said. And then a Socratic concern would be, and this is one of the critiques I've

638
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:18,400
had of sort of romanticism, right? Which is, how do we look for notice and ameliorate self-deception

639
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,920
that might arise in all of this work? Because pretending that there's no self-deception at

640
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:30,880
play in this, I think is foolish. And I seriously doubt that you would make, engage in that pretense.

641
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:38,800
So how, so here, here's the concern. Within therapy, I understand you are beholding to the

642
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:44,000
goal of healing. And that is important. But given a lot of things we've said, and given that we're

643
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,960
trying to make connections outside of therapy, to pedagogy, and where there are deeper goals of,

644
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,240
you know, right relationship to reality and the true, the good and the beautiful, the virtue,

645
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:03,120
then this issue around self-deception, I think comes up. And I would like to know, and if you want,

646
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,760
if you want to bleed into the next, our next conversation to address this more, that's fine.

647
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,480
But maybe just an initial concern. How do, and I mean, I mean it in that, I mean it in the

648
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:22,000
Platonic sense. How is rationality as the concern for self-deception, which can often mask as

649
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:34,880
self-transcendence, right? How is that concern properly, properly met? How can we be responsible

650
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:42,720
to that within an IFS practice? Is that a fair question? That's a very important question.

651
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:50,080
I really have to think about it more deeply to give an appropriate answer. But I would say the

652
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:59,280
initial, the initial response would be, and this goes back to the question you had before,

653
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,400
and I forgot to mention it because I also have critique for IFS. And I think now this comes

654
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:14,000
together, I think what IFS still can do better is to enhance the notion of something like

655
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:21,680
evil. And I think the ally work that you're alluding to and the archetypal work,

656
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:29,520
you know, the Hillman work, that is, I think that is still missing. Now, to be fair, IFS

657
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:36,000
is not one thing. This community has very diverse thinkers and there are, of course,

658
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,760
beautiful people that bring, that bring different aspects to it. But I would say to answer your

659
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:49,280
question is to address the self-deception is that I think it needs to be embedded within a system

660
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:58,080
of systems. And I think what we need to do in order to overcome self-deception is that

661
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:05,040
we cannot overlook the body. And I think this is very, very important. And there is this

662
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:12,400
brand of IFS, which is called Somatic IFS. Susan McConnell, she's wonderful. She's actually one

663
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:19,440
of those that close friends to Dick Schwartz who actually made the whole curriculum for the training

664
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,720
of IFS. So she's a brilliant mind. And she has this book, I have Somatic Experience, I don't know

665
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:30,240
if you know this. I have it. Oh, awesome. She writes really poetically and beautifully. I think so,

666
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:37,600
the body work is needed. And this is, I think, something you know as a practitioner of Tai Chi

667
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,960
Chuan and Greg Kelly. And we need to bring back the body. But we also need feedback systems and

668
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:51,520
people can be feedback systems, right? So if I do this work alone, so I have to have a community

669
01:12:51,520 --> 01:13:03,760
to do so. And this witnessing of healing is, again, it's tenfold if you witness it in the

670
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,000
community of healing. And I was privileged or I'm privileged to experience that over and over again

671
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,160
and say what happens when a collective comes together. Now, I think there is also a danger,

672
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,240
right? And this is also what Jung talks about when he talks about being one and not a zero.

673
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:24,880
It's like, okay, well, you have this or Nietzsche when he talks about the mass is going to one

674
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:33,840
direction, the ideological thing. So I really have to think about it.

675
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:42,000
Well, I mean, it links what, so let's just say that that's your initial foray and we'll come back

676
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,840
to it next time. But what you said does connect with what you said before about IFS needs to be

677
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:54,720
situated within a sapiential framework and ecology of practices. But I like your invocation of,

678
01:13:54,720 --> 01:14:01,120
you know, Rafe Kelly's work, the stuff on embodiment. I think that is deeply appropriate.

679
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:09,920
This is Marla Ponti that the body is really fundamental to keeping us anchored to the world

680
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:19,120
in a way that if we train the mind to properly listen, can act as, you know, a significant

681
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:25,040
counterbalance to spiritual bypassing and hubristic self-deception and other things.

682
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,920
So let's pick that up then. We'll pick up that in addition to the archetype of the adolescent

683
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:44,560
and ally work. We can talk a little bit more about bringing Ratio, a logos in the in

684
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:51,280
rationality in the Socratic-Platonic sense into conversation with IFS. So I really look forward

685
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:59,200
to this. I love my guests. This was, first of all, just, wow, really catching fire. Love this,

686
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:07,360
love this. You have a brilliant and scintillating mind, and yet it is clear that it is connected to

687
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:14,160
your heart. And I just, just enjoyed that. I talk about, you know, how certain people taste,

688
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:22,560
right, like the way, a work of art, you know, you taste really wonderfully. So that, I really

689
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,960
appreciate that. But I'd like to give my guests, I'd like to give my guests the last word.

690
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:38,800
Thank you, John. I deeply appreciate it. I don't know what to say. I'm grateful to be able to,

691
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:44,480
you know, to be talking to you. It's something that I've wanted now for years. And I think now

692
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,920
the time is right. And also, with regards to your viewers and followers,

693
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:59,360
I really think it's, it's, it's a kairos. I think we are at a pivotal point where things now come

694
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:09,920
together. And I want to thank you for everything you've done and you do. And I consider you a

695
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,680
really close friend. I mean, we haven't met personally yet. We can become that.

696
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:22,880
Yes, I hope so too. And we are 10,000 kilometers apart. But I don't know if you know this, but

697
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:31,600
you are, your voice and your spirit is, you know, fills my home and life and work every day. So,

698
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:38,080
in a sense, you're, you know, very close to me on a daily basis. And to be able to participate in

699
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:45,440
this whole endeavor is I'm really, really grateful for. And I want to thank you for also allowing

700
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,160
and giving the platform to come together. So thank you for that, John.

701
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:58,000
So we will speak again very soon. I would like that. I would love that, actually. Thank you.

702
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,240
Hello, everyone. I'd like to announce a new course. I'm going to be teaching at Halcyon Academy.

703
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:09,440
It's called Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond. I'll talk in a minute about that very provocative title.

704
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:16,640
First important things. It's going to be starting April 5th. It will be eight weeks,

705
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:21,920
not eight consecutive weeks, because I'm attending conferences, but it's all scheduled out. The link

706
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:30,960
to the home page for the course will be put in the notes to this promo. And each session will be

707
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:38,560
two hours. There'll be one hour of me doing a lecture and then one hour of Q&A. Now, there are

708
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,720
options you can purchase where you can attend the lecture live and participate in the live Q&A,

709
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:51,520
or you can also go through this course asynchronously and you can purchase it at that level if that

710
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:57,600
works better with your schedule and or your finances. I've done one of these courses before,

711
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:07,520
Beyond Nihilism, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I consider it, by all the feedback, a success,

712
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:15,760
and I very much wanted to follow it up, which gets me to the title. The Beyond was a way of

713
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,800
pointing to some continuity with the previous course, Beyond Nihilism, which is also available

714
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:28,800
asynchronously on Halkian, if you wish to take a look at that. I'm not assuming that people

715
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:34,960
have gone through Beyond Nihilism. The course Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond, is a standalone

716
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:41,680
course, but I've also structuring it so those people who have taken Beyond Nihilism will find

717
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:47,680
connection and continuity. That's a bit of a tricky thing to do as a teacher, but I do have quite a

718
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:52,720
bit of experience with doing that kind of thing for my many years of teaching at the university.

719
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,320
So that's one reason for the title. Now, the other title is God and Beyond. What could possibly be

720
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:07,600
beyond God? What could that mean? That's just a silly contradiction, isn't it? Well, that's the

721
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,840
issue. That's the issue that the course is going to wrestle with. When we come into or try to enter

722
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:20,480
into a philosophically reflective and deep relationship with what we consider to be Ultimate

723
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:28,320
Reality, is that relationship best captured by what we think of when we think of God? Now,

724
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,800
what many of you will say to me is that there's many different possible meanings,

725
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:40,160
and that's exactly what this course will explore. But the idea that there is a somewhat standard

726
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:47,920
notion, Abrahamic notion, perhaps, of God is one we'll be making use of, and whether or not

727
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,720
that actually is the best way of understanding Ultimate Reality.

728
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,120
So in order to do that, we'll be taking a look at a bunch of thinkers. The one is Robert Carter

729
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,520
in his amazing book, The Nothingness Beyond God, and you can see the title of that book,

730
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,360
Resonating with the title of the course, in which he explores the work of Nishita from the Kyoto

731
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:18,400
School, which is somebody deeply influenced by both Heidegger and Zen. And of course, Heidegger

732
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:25,360
famously, in his famous critique of ontotheology, criticized that our standard notion of God as a

733
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:33,840
Supreme Being fundamentally misrepresents being itself, because being itself is no kind of individual

734
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:40,160
thing or being. And that's the no-thingness beyond God. If God is some kind of super thing,

735
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:44,720
then Ultimate Reality is a no-thing beyond that. And that was explored, of course,

736
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:49,680
by Nishita, making use of both Heidegger and Zen. And we want to enter into discussion about this.

737
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,520
Please understand that this is a very exploratory thing. This course is helping me

738
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:01,680
do some deep thinking in dialogue with others who are coming in good faith and want to engage in

739
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:07,760
deep reflection and discussion in preparation for the next series I'm doing on the Philosophical

740
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:16,320
Silk Road. And so being part of the course is a way of participating in the contribution of

741
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:23,680
that project. We'll also be taking a look at the work of the Canadian atheist, Schellingbert,

742
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:30,240
especially in his book Evolutionary Religion, but we'll also be taking a look at all, at least,

743
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:35,520
be bringing in his book Religion and Religion After Science, and also talking about the

744
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,360
hiddenness argument. He is famous for being the author of the hiddenness argument,

745
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:47,120
which is considered a sort of new argument against the existence of a personal God. Now,

746
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:54,000
you may say, oh, an atheist. Be very careful. Schellingberg is not a typical atheist.

747
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:03,440
Schellingberg is somebody who wants us to look at, take very seriously the possibility of ultimate

748
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:09,920
reality and very seriously what he calls a triple transcendence. That ultimate reality

749
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:17,600
is transcendent in being most real. And also, it's also, in some sense, most valuable, you know,

750
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:23,680
beyond the true, the good, and the beautiful, and also most transformative. And he thinks this

751
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:28,480
proposal that human beings, that there is such an ultimate reality, that human beings can enter

752
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:35,280
into a relationship with it and be transformed by it, is one that we should take very seriously,

753
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:41,600
but within a particular frame. He says he points to deep time, how science has discovered deep

754
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:48,560
time, billions of years in the past, billions of years in the future. The species has existed

755
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:54,480
for 200,000 years. We seem to be spiritually oriented from about 40,000 BCE. So we have all

756
01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:02,160
of this going on, and yet we also have this deep future ahead of us. And he poses this question.

757
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:11,440
He says, given the depth of the questions we're asking about ultimate reality, is it like

758
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:17,520
that we are mature enough as a species that we have got complete answers to this? When, of course,

759
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:23,200
we don't have complete answers about the nature of the atom, or that we don't have complete answers

760
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:28,720
about how disease works, or how the mind works, or how the body works. Isn't it presumptuous to

761
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:37,360
think that we have finished complete answers about ultimate reality? So he wants us to engage in

762
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:44,960
the reflect upon the proposal that we might be as a species, not individual, spiritually immature.

763
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:54,480
And then he asks, what do we need to do in order to mature ourselves across time and across generations

764
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:01,520
such that we could come into the kind of work that would give us

765
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:10,800
a plausible claim on getting an answer to that question of whether or not ultimate reality

766
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:16,960
has that triple transcendence for us. And I think this is a very profound idea, because I think the

767
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:24,400
deep time aspect of our reflections upon ultimate reality within standard axial age religion,

768
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:32,560
and philosophy has not been properly understood or taken into account. And so this is very

769
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:38,320
provocative. It opens us up and it, of course, allows science at the table. Now, of course,

770
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:43,120
he also criticizes, and this is what makes him so interesting, he also criticizes the atheists

771
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:50,320
who think they can come to a complete conclusion about ultimate reality from a framework that

772
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:58,720
is very plausibly one of spiritual immaturity. So we will be taking a look at that, and we'll be

773
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:06,720
looking at what happens if we adopt deep humility with respect to the question of ultimate reality,

774
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,400
God and beyond. What happens? What do we open ourselves up to? And what becomes really important

775
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:19,760
for him is the role, the aspirational role of imagination, especially in the imaginal sense.

776
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,520
We'll then be taking a look at the astonishing work of James Filler, who I will actually be

777
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:31,200
meeting in person in April. Unfortunately, his book is quite expensive, so instead we'll be reading

778
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:38,560
three papers where he makes the argument that the Neoplatonic tradition made an argument,

779
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:45,280
which is that ultimate reality is pure relationality rather than a substance. Now,

780
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,920
when he uses substance, he's ultimately meaning it in not just a Cartesian sense,

781
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,200
but in Aristotelian. Substance is our individual things that are considered to be able to exist

782
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:01,760
independently and are the subjects of properties. They're the owner of properties,

783
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:08,320
and they enter into relations with other things. And so there are things from which

784
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,840
relations emerge. And Filler's arguments go to show that that seems to have things exactly

785
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:20,320
the wrong way around. It looks like relationality is ultimate, and the things emerge out of it.

786
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:25,680
And so, of course, this relationality is a no thing, because that's just what things emerge from.

787
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,880
And this meshes, of course, with some of the fundamental arguments of Neoplatonism.

788
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:39,680
And I think moving off of that thing-based substance ontology is a fundamental shift,

789
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:46,880
a new way of thinking profoundly and relating to ultimate reality that takes us into that space

790
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:54,960
of God and beyond. The final person is Bracken, whose book The Divine Matrix is written from a

791
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,440
Whiteheadian perspective, which I think is very important, because Whitehead, in some ways,

792
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:05,440
integrates that pure relationality with the dynamic view of the world given to us by science.

793
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,560
But what he does is he takes a look, Bracken, at the Western traditions, reflections on ultimate

794
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:20,320
reality, and Eastern reflections, Taoism, Vedanta, Buddhism. And he is trying to propose

795
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,760
what we can see being held in common. And this, of course, is very much like a through line,

796
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:30,000
like the philosophical Silk Road. And he comes to some very interesting

797
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:38,240
conclusions from this argument about what ultimate reality is and how we could come to

798
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:43,280
a shared understanding. It doesn't mean we all will become Hindus, or we'll all become Buddhists,

799
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:48,240
or we'll all even become Whiteheadians, or that we will all become Christians or Jews.

800
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:54,080
What he says is this gives us a shareable relationship to ultimate reality between people

801
01:27:54,080 --> 01:28:00,400
who talk about that ultimate reality as a God, and people like Taoists with the Tao,

802
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:05,440
or the Vedantas with Brahmin, or the Buddhists with Shunyata, who do not talk about ultimate

803
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:13,200
reality as God, but nevertheless consider it to be triply transcendent. And so this is all in

804
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:19,920
service of an observation that I have been sharing with a lot of the people that I enter

805
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,280
in deep discussion with, which is in response to the meaning crisis, there seems to be an advent

806
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,720
of the sacred taking place in many different parts of the world, different communities,

807
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,880
different philosophical currents. And I've just pointed to you a bunch. There's many,

808
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:42,560
many more that converge on this. People are fundamentally reframing our relationship to

809
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:48,640
ultimate reality. And I think this is a way of trying to give us a new way of living in

810
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:55,360
relationship to the sacred, which will offer people a living response to the problem of

811
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:02,320
the meaning crisis. Now, this is all something I am proposing. And I am proposing that we discuss

812
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:09,600
it together. And you help me as much as I try to teach you that we discuss it together as we

813
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:16,560
try to wrestle with this question about ultimate reality, God and beyond. So I look forward to

814
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:23,440
seeing you in the course. As I said, the notes for both the date, which starts on April the 5th,

815
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,400
and the link and how you can register will be found in the end, will contain the information

816
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:36,400
in the notes to this promo. So thank you very much. And I look forward to seeing you in ultimate

817
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,400
reality, God and beyond.
