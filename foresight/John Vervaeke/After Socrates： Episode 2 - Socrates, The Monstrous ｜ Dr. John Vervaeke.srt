1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Educing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself, that is to be on

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,160
the horizon of wonder.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:19,480
It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question so a

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:43,720
new self in a new world can deeply be born.

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,920
Welcome back to episode 2 of After Socrates.

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,920
First time we looked at four ways we are after the way of Socrates and we also reviewed

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,120
the basic format of the series.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,280
Now let's continue being after Socrates.

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:09,080
Right now at the beginning as we orient ourselves to find our way, let's follow Socrates.

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,600
In order to follow Socrates we have to understand how he understood himself and this is going

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,440
to be perplexing.

12
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:29,760
Socrates' self-knowledge, he found himself and frequently described himself as a tipos,

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:39,360
not belonging to any particular category, like our word atypical but deeper, more powerful.

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,560
He explicitly refers to himself sometimes and Plato has other characters refer to him

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:53,840
in terms of monsters, as monstrous, he's like a satyr, he's like a stingray, he compares

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,800
himself to a titan, many different kinds of monsters, this is a recurring thing across

17
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,320
many of the dialogues.

18
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:16,200
Namely, he describes himself as metaxu, as fundamentally in between, in between the human

19
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
and the divine.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,080
I'm going to come back to that because Socrates never thinks that he becomes anything other

21
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,960
than a human being, so he says we like him, at least he's challenging us to realize that

22
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:39,840
we like him, are somehow in between human finitude and the transcendence of the divine.

23
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,080
Drew Highland, excellent book and we'll come back to it, talks about finitude and transcendence

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,680
in the platonic dialogues.

25
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,240
Socrates does something really interesting when he says that he's metaxu, he says so

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:08,200
is eros, eros isn't a human but it's a transhuman force, it's not a god, eros is a daemon, d-a-e-m-o-n,

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:18,760
not a daemon but a daemon, a being that is between and therefore mediates and unites

28
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,040
the human and the divine, just think about it, isn't there something really insightful

29
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,280
in that about love?

30
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:40,200
So Socrates he understands himself as fundamentally liminal, he's within and without, sort of

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,280
fits our categories but he doesn't, he's monstrous, the monster takes the normal categories

32
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:55,800
and distorts them in a way that is startling and challenging and disruptive.

33
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Somehow Socrates transcends our normal framing in a way that is challenging and even at times

34
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,760
threatening.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,800
How is Socrates within and without, how is he liminal, how is he monstrous in a way that's

36
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,880
constantly challenging and threatening to us but nevertheless beneficial to us?

37
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:37,920
And how does he do this while never claiming to be anything other than a mortal?

38
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:47,920
A mortal doomed to die human being.

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,400
So Socrates enters into these intensive in terms of how he's involved with people but

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,680
extensive in terms of how much scope they take in, how much they zoom in and zoom out,

41
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,680
probative conversations with people.

42
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,480
And in these conversations questioning, not just questions, questioning, it's even better

43
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,600
perhaps to hear a related word to questioning, questioning.

44
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,360
Questioning plays a central part rather than concluding.

45
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,160
These exploratory dialogues are often centered on what is virtue, what is wisdom, related

46
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,280
things, what is knowledge, what is goodness, what is real?

47
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,360
And these are questions and this is the importance.

48
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,200
These are questions we cannot ignore, this is why we cannot ignore Socrates, we can't

49
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,280
ignore these questions, we can pretend to ignore them, but then we're just giving answers

50
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,440
to these questions given to us implicitly, unconsciously, automatically and we reactively

51
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:10,480
acting them out rather than acting on principle.

52
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Yet these dialogues frequently and frustratingly and profoundly inconclusively, inconclusively,

53
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,280
everybody including, really hear that, including Socrates, they've been talking about courage

54
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
at the end of it.

55
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:46,680
Everybody says, I don't know what courage is, including Socrates.

56
00:06:46,680 --> 00:07:02,080
Socrates claims to have achieved human wisdom in that he, by practicing this kind of dialogue,

57
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:11,880
has come to know that he does not know and we go, what, that's it, we're all ignorant,

58
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:21,640
I know, there's tons I don't know, well how is this, what's going on?

59
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,760
Socrates doesn't mean that generic belief.

60
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:36,680
Existentially in the situation, specific realization in both senses of the word, it's a palpable

61
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,440
reality and one is coming to a deep understanding awareness of how one is ignorant in this situation

62
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:53,280
in a way that matters because one has been pretending deeply, unconsciously, automatically

63
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,960
reactive to know, know both the situation and know oneself relevant to and relative

64
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,640
to that situation.

65
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,200
This is a profound kind of realization.

66
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,120
It requires disciplined mindfulness.

67
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:23,920
He has cultivated, and this is going to become an important phrase, he has learned, learned

68
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
ignorance.

69
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,720
In fact, when I say learned ignorance, I want you to hear both pronunciations, learned and

70
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
learned.

71
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
He has learned ignorance.

72
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:46,720
He has become aware of his ignorance in a way that makes a huge difference to specific

73
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,400
actual concrete situations.

74
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,560
So let's explore the dynamics of this a little bit better.

75
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,480
So we have, on one pole, we have conversation.

76
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,200
Socrates is engaging in a conversation.

77
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,160
I want you to start to get a feel for this.

78
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,480
I want you to think of those conversations you've been in, where you're asking each other

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,320
questions and you're not giving sort of pat answers.

80
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,760
You're really opening up, a person's opening up and you're opening up, you're reciprocally

81
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,160
opening, and the conversation starts to take on a life of its own.

82
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,200
And it's not wandering aimlessly, it's wandering fruitfully, and you both find you're getting

83
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,360
to places and having insights, realizations that you couldn't have had on your own.

84
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,280
When the conversation comes to an end, you say, that was one of the greatest moments

85
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,760
of my life.

86
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
Socrates is like that.

87
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,480
He talks about it.

88
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,880
You may not get that sense when you're reading the dialogues, because it seems like there's

89
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,360
a lot of conflict and argumentation.

90
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,240
But Socrates says, in more than one place, but in one space specifically, he says, I'm

91
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,560
willing to follow the logos, dia logos, and we're going to come back to, what is this

92
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,040
logo he's talking about?

93
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,640
But he's willing to follow the logos wherever it goes, like the wind.

94
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
Isn't that amazing?

95
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,160
The wind.

96
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:38,160
It seems to have a life of its own, but the wind, spiritus, wind, inspiration, aspiration,

97
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
spirituality.

98
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,360
When Jesus is talking to Nicodemus and telling him he has to be born again, he talks about

99
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
the wind is like, the spirit is like the wind.

100
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,760
It comes and goes as it would, and you know where it's coming from, and you don't know

101
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,200
where it's going to, but you can get caught up in it and follow it and breathe it and

102
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,480
been inspired to aspire by it.

103
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,480
That's one pole.

104
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:16,560
It's important to realize that Socrates is being just as surprised by the way the conversation,

105
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
the dialogue, is going.

106
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,880
He's just as much surprised by the dia, by way of, by means of logos, the dia logos as

107
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,200
anyone else participating, and you'll see how much he comes to deeply value this.

108
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,560
He's not experiencing this just as rough, you know, back and forth adversarial thing.

109
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,200
There's a deeper thing going on, and you'll see this in what he says about this practice.

110
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Now, this is one pole.

111
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,880
The other pole is this learned ignorance.

112
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,680
You say, what's, like, why is that valuable?

113
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,560
Well, think about it.

114
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:05,240
What the dia logos is doing is it's taking you to the horizon of wonder.

115
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,800
Securiosity is when I don't know something, I need that information, there's a gap in

116
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,280
my knowledge, hey, look, this fills it, and now I'm done.

117
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,480
I have what I need.

118
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,680
It's very much as Fromm would say in the having mode, but wonder, at least the way Fuller

119
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,960
and others argue about it, wonder is the being mode.

120
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,520
You come to the horizon, now think about the horizon, you can actually never reach it,

121
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,620
but there's a horizon, and at the, when you look at the horizon, you have a sense of what

122
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,880
is within your understanding, but how it is, how it is on the cusp of what is beyond your

123
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,440
understanding.

124
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,200
The horizon of wonder.

125
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,040
Socrates famously said that wisdom begins in wonder.

126
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,320
Why, what's going on?

127
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,880
In wonder, you're not filling the hole.

128
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,000
You're opening it up to the horizon.

129
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,400
You are calling yourself and the way you have framed the world into question, but in a way

130
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:27,160
you feel called to, in a way that is somehow beautiful to you, that is drawing from you.

131
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,520
This is, the word for it to draw forth is educe, this is where we get the word education

132
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,760
from, but think of it, it's a different kind of education.

133
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,040
This isn't here's, the knowledge you need, and so you can service the workplace and the

134
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,040
market until you die, and otherwise meaning was death.

135
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,360
They don't mean education like that.

136
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,440
You mean inducing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself.

137
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,400
That is to be on the horizon of wonder.

138
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:04,760
It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question, so a

139
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,560
new self in a new world can deeply be born.

140
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,080
That is what's going on in this process.

141
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:23,480
So notice, there's a discipline.

142
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,800
What does the word discipline mean?

143
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,200
It means to follow.

144
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,960
It means to track.

145
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:37,960
It means to follow and track so that you are transformed by that following.

146
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:48,560
There's a discipline to following the logos, dia logos, letting it call you into question,

147
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,880
letting it call your world into question, so that you and the person you're in dialogue

148
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,840
with are giving birth to yourselves, mutual midwiving.

149
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:06,240
Socrates was clear that he was not only examining others and helping them give birth to themselves.

150
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,920
He repeatedly emphasized it was reciprocal.

151
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,360
He was also examining himself and giving birth to himself.

152
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,160
They were mutually interwoven.

153
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:32,400
So the discipline of following the logos that allows us this mutual midwifing allows the

154
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:48,520
logos to take on a life of its own and thereby transform the way we are living.

155
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:57,880
Socrates, and it's often talked about using this practice called unlinkus, this questioning

156
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,680
and answering and probative.

157
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,560
And as we'll see, the unlinkus slowly in the hands of Plato becomes dialectic.

158
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,720
This disciplined following of the logos, this mutual midwifing and affording of the logos

159
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:23,440
to take on a life transforming life of its own.

160
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,680
So we've got a discipline.

161
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,840
So there are a set of practices.

162
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:39,080
Let's call those with Plato dialectic, this is not Hegel's dialectic, this is a way of

163
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:46,840
structuring dialogue in a disciplined manner so that it will take on the features of the

164
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
logos.

165
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,040
So there's a practice, there's something we can do dialectic, it's doing this mutual

166
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:03,720
midwifing and affording the presencing of the living logos.

167
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:12,360
That practice can result in a process that we do not make.

168
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,160
It's a process between us and between us and the world, the taxu, and it's like eros,

169
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:27,080
it's like love, especially in the platonic sense.

170
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:36,120
You don't make love, well we do say you make love, but what I mean by that, let's think

171
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:44,200
of it as analogous, oh it's a kind of love itself too, in fact it's a kind of platonic

172
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
eros.

173
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,360
Platonic love, friendship, profound friendship.

174
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,120
You can't just make somebody your friend.

175
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,920
You can't say you're my friend now, that's it, I've decided it, I make it so.

176
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,880
That's in fact, that's going to go nowhere, in fact it's probably going to have the opposite

177
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
result.

178
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,880
You can't just sort of passively wait around, someday a friend will come, somebody will

179
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,880
come up to me and say I'm your friend, probably not.

180
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:24,360
That's why we use metaphors of like falling in love, growing in love, we participate in

181
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
it.

182
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:34,480
So it's a practice we can do, we can discipline ourselves, to follow the logos, to mutually

183
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,760
midwife, to afford the logos taking on a life of its own.

184
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:50,400
That's dialectic, but the process of the logos is not something we do, it is something we

185
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,840
participate in profoundly, the way we participate in love, friendship, it is between us and

186
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,160
between us and the world.

187
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:14,040
The practice of dialectic, the process of the logos, that's why Fowler put in both

188
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:25,640
the logos and dialectic in the classical tradition, but there's also a state, here's

189
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,120
the the logos and learned ignorance and they're mutually affording each other, the the logos

190
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:40,000
gets us to the horizon of wonder and that opens us up and makes it possible for us to

191
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,640
reciprocally open with each other and reciprocally open with the world and then that affords the

192
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:55,760
logos and the the logos affords learned ignorance and we cycle the practice of dialectic, the

193
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:04,360
process of the logos and the paradoxical state of learned ignorance.

194
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:15,760
But is not all of this problematic, you should say to me, you should say, this looks like

195
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,760
you know a lot of knowledge, a lot of learning and Socrates is claiming, right, that all

196
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,680
he knows is that he does not know. That's actually not accurate. Many people put that

197
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,680
talk, all that Socrates ever said is that he know that he know, no, no, he doesn't

198
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,080
say that. He said that's what his wisdom consists in. Socrates actually claims to know a bunch

199
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,120
of things. So first of all, we have to modify it, but then we'll come back to your point

200
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,360
because you are making a good point in posing that problem. What does Socrates claim to know?

201
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,400
He famously claims to know erotica. He knew he knows about the erotic things. That doesn't

202
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,320
mean he's really good in bed or he just knows about sex. He's talking about eros in a much

203
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,800
more comprehensive sense about how we seek to bind ourselves to things. And this seems

204
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:17,360
inherent to us. We seem by nature to be looking for things other than ourselves to complete

205
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,040
us. And notice how that gets us into self-transcendence. I'm looking for something that's other than

206
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:28,360
me to become me so that I am more than me, but completed as me. And so as you think about

207
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,360
this, you start to go, oh, how does that make sense? Hold on to that vertigo. We're going

208
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:49,080
to come back to it. Socrates knows how to track eros. Do you? Well, I know what it's... Yeah,

209
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,680
I know you know what it's like to feel eros. I do too. But can you feel eros in a way so

210
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,080
that you don't do all the self-deceptive, self-destructive things you've done because

211
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,760
of that feeling? Because when you track, you're following, but you're also able to know and

212
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:17,080
see where something is going to go. When you're tracking a storm and following it, you're

213
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,280
trying to predict where it's going to go so you can avoid being overwhelmed by it. Socrates

214
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,320
knows how to track eros. He knows how to follow the trail of signs. He knows how to properly

215
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:42,560
apprehend and appreciate the significance of eros. He knows what to care about. He would do this

216
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,680
provocatively. As I already said, he would go into people and he'd say, why are you spending so

217
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,880
much time on your hair and your clothing and how you smell? And so little time on your psyche,

218
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:01,160
so little time on your mind and your soul and your character. You go, yeah, why am I?

219
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,480
Socrates would walk into the marketplace and say, look at all the things I don't need.

220
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:18,280
You go, oh, right. Why don't I do that? That's the socratic question. It's a question about

221
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,160
Socrates that reverberates back and becomes a question, a wondering about yourself and the world

222
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,160
that you live in. So Socrates knows erotica.

223
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:42,120
How can we know this? How can we do this in practice? How can we realize it in practice?

224
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:51,480
We will come back to this. Socrates also, and he states it very confidently, he knows the difference

225
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:59,880
between belief or opinion and knowledge. He knows it. Now, how can he know this when he claims to

226
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,640
know that he doesn't know anything? He actually claims to know a lot of things.

227
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,800
He knows how to do geometry with Domino.

228
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:31,160
He'll often say he knows how this practice works, how this art, or actually more specifically,

229
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,480
more technically, how this technique, how this particular kind of expertise works.

230
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:50,600
See, what Socrates means is he knows how to track, he knows how to follow, he knows how to quest

231
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,680
after knowledge in a way that's not just haphazard.

232
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:07,880
That doesn't mean he's got there. He knows what virtue is in a sense the way you know by being.

233
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,680
He certainly doesn't claim to have wisdom.

234
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:25,400
But he doesn't claim to be completely ignorant of it. He claims to be a lover of wisdom. There's

235
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,440
the connection to love, except this time it's not eros, and this is important. It's philea.

236
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,240
It's the kind of love between friends, or even more importantly, fellowship,

237
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,880
people working in concert together. He knows how to work with people.

238
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:52,680
In order to be properly oriented towards wisdom. When you really love your friend,

239
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,640
when you really love your romantic partner, have you got them?

240
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:07,080
Like, I figured you out. We're done. I don't need to learn it. I got it. We're finished.

241
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,120
I've got the perfect framing for you that holds you perfectly in place,

242
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,040
reveals everything that there is possibly to know, but I've got you. Yep.

243
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,960
I say to you, in fact, if you say that, that's a strong predictor that your relationship is actually over.

244
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,040
What are you actually?

245
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,880
You have a faithfulness to this person.

246
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,800
You know how to follow them, to track them. They're going to change, and you know how to

247
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,040
dash. You don't know where they're going. You don't know what kind of changes you're going

248
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:57,000
to go through, how you're going to dance with them. But you keep teaching each other how to

249
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,160
follow each other. And the person, although you have a continuity of contact and you're

250
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,440
loving them, and they're opening up to you, and you're opening up to them with supercal opening,

251
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,920
there's always that which exceeds. It's funny, you can meet people

252
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
been together for a very long time, and this has probably happened to you.

253
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,600
Our friends come up to you and say, you know, I've been with her for like 10 years. And then,

254
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,720
wow, I just like, she did that. And wow, totally caught me by surprise. I just, poof.

255
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:40,440
Because you have to remember learned ignorance. How much you really don't know,

256
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,280
because of how really dynamically complex another person is.

257
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:56,040
And wisdom and virtue are excellences of persons. And you can never fully know a person. How could

258
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:03,800
you possibly fully know the excellence of personhood? But you can love it the way you love

259
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,560
a particular person.

260
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:22,040
Think of the connection between able to really wonder, not in the sense we sometimes overlap

261
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:31,000
with anxiety, but wonder about your friend or your partner to be amazed by them.

262
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm very fortunate to have a romantic partner that she's one of the best people I've met in my life.

263
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,920
And she constantly exceeds. And this is something I have to keep remembering,

264
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:58,280
relearning. Sati, mindfulness means to remember, not in the sense of just recalling, but reminding

265
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,960
yourself, bringing that memory into action. Mindfulness, I have to constantly remember,

266
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:12,280
remind myself that she exceeds all of my personal experience, all of my professional expertise.

267
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,840
And she does this so regularly. And yes, so beautifully. I have profound friends. You're

268
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,240
going to meet one of them, Christopher Master Pietro. Same thing within friendship.

269
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:46,200
Wonder. Love. The cultivation of wisdom. Deep continuity of growing contact.

270
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,520
They're all bound together and learned ignorance.

271
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,440
Socrates also claims to know two really deep and fundamental things.

272
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,000
He famously, in his defense at his trial,

273
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,160
knows that the unexamined life is not worth living.

274
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,400
He knows this with such confidence that he is willing to die for it.

275
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,440
No propositional argument could convince you of that.

276
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,120
But somebody with such powerful presence as Socrates was willing to die for it.

277
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:40,200
That's at least challenging. He claims a life without dialectic into deologos.

278
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,240
Affording learned ignorance is not worth living.

279
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:55,800
Socrates is as ignorant as we thought when we just thought, oh, he just doesn't know that he

280
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:02,120
knows. He says, I know that I don't know. I'm skeptical of a lot of things. I'm cynical. I live

281
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:09,880
in modernity, postmodernity. No, no, no. This is not knowing that at the same time

282
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,280
gives him the confidence to die as he's telling you and I, because I'm feeling it too.

283
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,360
The unexamined life is not worth living. And what do you do with that? Think about it.

284
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,040
Because I'm sure my life is pretty unexamined. I don't have that self-knowledge.

285
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:41,800
My life's not worth living. Sometimes I wake up at 3 a.m. and he's sort of right.

286
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:49,000
I don't want to think about that. He's saying that. And then relatedly, he's saying

287
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:58,360
that doing this dialectic into deologos and cultivating this learned ignorance, this wonderful,

288
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:10,440
wonder-filled, learned ignorance is the best activity that human beings can engage in.

289
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
It's the best kind of life.

290
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:25,080
But how? How could a practice that is so frequently frustrating

291
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:33,240
it does not produce conclusions? It does not produce clear answers? It does not give us

292
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,320
resolution in the sense of completion and finality?

293
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:45,560
How could that be worth dying for? That sounds like an utter waste of time at best

294
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,800
and endlessly annoying and frustrating and undermining of all of our projects.

295
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,680
How could that be? How could that be?

296
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,080
Savor that question because I've actually returned to the question you asked a few

297
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:09,400
minutes ago and I've made it deeper on your behalf. By the way, that's me exemplifying Socrates,

298
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,400
taking your question and making it deeper on your behalf.

299
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:21,400
Take that question in. Savor it. Let it roll around in your mind.

300
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,600
Try to feel into its monstrous challenge.

301
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,120
Think about how it challenges all of our assumptions,

302
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:47,960
how it crashes into so many of our presuppositions about success and purpose

303
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:56,440
and achieving your goals and completion, consummation, conclusion, and how all of these

304
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:05,000
are so central to a good life. That question about Socrates just smashes into all of that

305
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,840
monstrously.

306
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:20,200
How could this Socratic proposal possibly be true in any way? In fact, in any way that we could

307
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,240
actually realize in regular practice.

308
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,880
But the problematic around Socrates, the way he's liminal, atypous, monstrous is even deeper.

309
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:48,920
Socrates clearly and repeatedly argues for three things. Number one,

310
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,800
the best life is the life of virtue. First of all, really how? It's a provocative statement

311
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:05,000
and therefore claiming to know this is again really important. Socrates claims to know that

312
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:13,160
the life of virtue is the best kind of life. He claims to know that virtue depends on knowledge.

313
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,560
Sometimes some people have rendered that as an identity claim. I won't do that because that's

314
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,840
controversial. But at least virtue depends on knowledge. But what kind of knowledge does virtue

315
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,520
depend on? Okay, good question. We'll come back to it. But first of all, life of virtue is the best

316
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:36,920
life. Virtue depends on knowledge, at least a particular kind of knowledge. And then Socrates

317
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,800
repeatedly, and we've already seen it, claims that he does not have the knowledge needed for virtue.

318
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,240
How do those hang together? How can that be the case?

319
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,760
And you can say, well, maybe Socrates, if you put those three together, you can put them together

320
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:03,720
and say, well, Socrates is just realizing he's just kind of a buffoon. And of course, there were

321
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,440
people that thought that, Aristophanes famously in his play the clouds.

322
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,000
But Socrates claims to know what a good life is such that he is willing to die for it.

323
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,480
How does that fit in with that, right? That doesn't fit in with being a buffoon.

324
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:40,600
And Plato clearly and repeatedly presents Socrates as the most virtuous person living the most

325
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
worthwhile and virtuous life.

326
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:52,920
At the end of the phato, this is the dialogue in which Socrates actually dies.

327
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:05,480
After Socrates is dead, these last words are spoken.

328
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:17,240
Very last words. Super salient. The culmination point of the dialogue. Not really, but yes,

329
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,480
here salient, at the end, we're supposed to reflect upon everything else.

330
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,600
Such was the end,

331
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,920
Echocrates, of our friend. Socrates was just died.

332
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:41,720
Of our friend whom I may truly, wow, call the wisest

333
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,480
and justice most just and best of all men, best of all men.

334
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Who am I ever known?

335
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,320
How is this the case? How could this be the case?

336
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:20,280
How could that learned ignorance give Socrates the knowledge of the good life,

337
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,600
the confidence in it, for which he's willing to die?

338
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,080
How could that, that thing that challenges all of our assumptions about the good life,

339
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,920
how could that make him the wisest, the most virtuous,

340
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,720
living the most worthwhile life? How?

341
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,680
How could we possibly realize this, understand it, and such that we could put it into practice?

342
00:38:51,640 --> 00:39:02,280
When you roll this around in your mind, it feels like a profound paradox.

343
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,360
He seems to be not knowing, and yet he seems to have all of the results

344
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,240
of the knowing that he says he does not have and does not know.

345
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,680
This feels monstrous, doesn't fit in any of our categories. He's not a buffoon,

346
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,440
but he's not the typical successful person. He doesn't seem to have knowledge,

347
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,480
but he seems to be wise, like what's going on?

348
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,000
Now in response to this, and many people have done this, they even do it in the dialogues,

349
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,280
Plato repeatedly shows that, you can just reject Socrates.

350
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,240
You can say, he's just confused, he's just all messed up.

351
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,480
You can just turn away. You can reorient yourself away from the Socratic path.

352
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:13,000
It's easy to do, but that ease is only superficial, because if you stop and reflect

353
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,520
at a deeper level, it's actually harder to turn away, to disorient yourself from the Socratic way.

354
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:30,120
When you read these dialogues, and when you start to practice what Socrates does,

355
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,520
you see Socrates disclosing so much self-deceptive, pretense, bullshit,

356
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,960
misframing, failure to appreciate properly, failure to understand appropriately,

357
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:55,240
failure to love wisely. Socrates is powerful, and you go, I need all of that, and I put it to you.

358
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,680
Is this not needed now, more so than ever?

359
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,800
Yes, it seems to be. Socrates affords transframing.

360
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,000
What do I mean by that? Well, it's a combination of transcendence, transformation, and reframing.

361
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,400
You know when you have an insight, and you realize you've been misframing,

362
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:34,680
not properly proportioning and directing your attention, I thought she was being aggressive,

363
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,200
afraid. Oh, I've just been mishandling this whole thing. I was mistaken.

364
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,920
It's insight. But you can also get what John Wright following Iris Murdoch, and I talk a lot

365
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,520
about this in Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, called Sensibility to Transcendence. I can get

366
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,960
simultaneously an insight into that person, and a reflective insight into me,

367
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,880
that the way I have habitually been framing or thinking about things or being with people

368
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:15,240
also needs to be reframed. And I can be reframing that person and reframing my sense of who I am

369
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,480
and how I look at the world. And that means I start to reciprocally open. I start to transcend

370
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,680
myself. I start to afford that person to transcend my conception of them. I start to be transformed.

371
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,880
They start to be transformed in how they are and can be to me.

372
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:42,680
Transframing. Socrates affords that. And here's the thing. That transframing ability seems to be

373
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:50,760
central to becoming wiser. It seems central to a lot of spirituality. And if we want wise

374
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,560
spirituality, and don't we, can we afford to turn away from Socrates?

375
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:09,240
Socrates deeply inspires, affords aspiration of the Platonic tradition, the Stoic tradition,

376
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,160
and the Neoplatonic tradition. And all of these are going through significant revivals right now.

377
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:21,560
And for good reason, they are needed in our times. And if they are needed, so is Socrates,

378
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,000
because Socrates is at the heart of them. You can't pull apart Plato and Socrates.

379
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,880
Stoicism is the religious philosophy or the philosophical religion, I don't know which,

380
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,040
what to call it, of internalizing Socrates. At least central aspects of everything I've been

381
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:48,360
talking about. Neoplatonism is, and we'll see this, the profound pathway into the deepest

382
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:55,000
possible learned ignorance. We can't turn away from Socrates.

383
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:05,720
Socrates is like all the other sages who are paradoxical, atypos and strange. If we turn

384
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,920
away from Socrates, we turn away from Siddhartha Gautama, we turn away from Jesus of Nazareth,

385
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,120
we turn away from Swangsha, we turn away from Lao Tse, we turn away from etc, etc.

386
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,840
Can you afford to turn away from all those sages? Are you so confident

387
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:32,600
that you can reorient away from all of them and find the path to wisdom, virtue, meaning in life?

388
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:43,800
Think about it. Be honest. I propose, and this is an honest proposal, in the sense that this

389
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,960
isn't my life, this is how I try to live. I propose trying to move deeply into this problematic

390
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:59,240
of Socrates. I want to allow it the real possibility of challenging me, of transforming me,

391
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:10,040
of calling me into transforming. I want to move through, like the through of my lenses.

392
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:17,000
I want to move through this Socratic problematic. I aspire to this. I have tried to dedicate my life

393
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:30,520
to it. To do this deeply, we need to confront further dimensions of this problematic.

394
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:41,800
Socrates does not have a method. So how do we move forward in a practice? How do we

395
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:52,120
forward into the problematic? Is Socrates just Plato's mouthpiece? Are the words of Socrates

396
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,480
equivalent to what Plato wants us to get from the dialogue? That's problematic too.

397
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,200
The third wave, people like Gonzales and Hyland,

398
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:10,680
just several rapes, just so many people, so many of those books.

399
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:21,000
I'll argue, no. Plato wrote in a dialogue form in which he is only in one, I think in the apology,

400
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:30,360
in just very minor way, actually present. He's absent. He never puts himself in the dialogue.

401
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:36,600
And the dialogue is not there as sort of literary ornamentation around Socrates.

402
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,000
In fact, and this will be central to following Socrates,

403
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:50,280
the collective intelligence and the distributed cognition of all of the characters in the dialogue

404
00:46:50,920 --> 00:47:03,000
is actually central to us following the Socratic path. Socrates is central. He's important in the

405
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:13,480
dialogue. But he's also in service to the Deologos, the way other people are drawn out, the way other

406
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:20,760
people represent alternative perspectives, alternative ways of being that Socrates takes into account,

407
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,840
which is one interpretation, one translation of the word logos, by the way,

408
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,840
taking into account, giving an account.

409
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:38,760
One way in which we can understand this is can we

410
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,640
get into a flow state, logos with the life of its own,

411
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,360
of the collective intelligence of distributed cognition,

412
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:05,720
that has the capacity to cultivate both individual and collective wisdom. Can we be

413
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:16,520
Socrates to each other? Because if we need Socrates to do this, and all of the traditions say,

414
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,200
in one sense we do, but in another sense we don't, then of course we couldn't do it.

415
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:29,720
We need to know how to internalize Socrates, both within us individually and between us collectively.

416
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:45,000
One function of the dialogues, I think, and how they're not replaceable by just capturing,

417
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,240
this is an argument made by Socrates, and this represents Plato's theory.

418
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:59,480
One function of the dialog format is it affords internalization. What's internalization?

419
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:11,240
This is a notion drawn from Bogotsky. This is the notion that, let's say a child is learning,

420
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,400
and for some of you you've heard this before, but for some of you maybe not.

421
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,680
How does learning? They're taking a particular perspective on a problem.

422
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,280
The adult comes in to try and teach them. I've raised children.

423
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,200
The adult has a more encompassing and penetrating perspective

424
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:38,120
that includes but transcends. Hear that, it includes but transcends the child's perspective.

425
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:53,720
But the child does imitate the adult. And as they imitate the adult, they start to

426
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,480
enact the perspective that the adult has. As they presence the adult in imitation,

427
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:07,000
they start to fill in the perspective that the adult had on their perspective.

428
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:13,160
And eventually they do this to such a degree that they do not need the adult present. They

429
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,720
can do it for themselves, and then they get metacognition. They can step back and reflect

430
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,120
on their own cognition. They could perhaps come to know that they do not know.

431
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:32,920
You see that? See, when you're in a perspective, remember when we compared the first person

432
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,920
perspective, there's a third person perspective, when you're asking your friend about the problem

433
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:45,880
that they're having. When you're in a perspective, that framing, it blinds you to what's outside

434
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:50,120
the perspective. You can't see the biases of your perspective, and you can't take on new

435
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:57,800
interest beyond your perspective. But when you internalize other people, you transcend,

436
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,080
and you get the capacity to itself transcend,

437
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:10,920
you get the capacity to self-correct, to overcome bias, and to orient more properly

438
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:17,560
and appropriately towards reality. But as the child is to the adult,

439
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,320
the adult is to the sage, just as a child you needed to internalize adults.

440
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:35,720
As an adult, you need to internalize a sage. Why could you possibly think you're done?

441
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:58,920
Okay, but Socrates problematizes this. What? How? Well, he often speaks and presents himself ironically.

442
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:07,080
In fact, this is one of the most famous aspects of Socrates. He's ironic. Now, he's not ironic in

443
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:15,720
sort of our modern cynical sense of irony, but he's often saying something that's opposite

444
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:21,720
to what he actually holds to be the case, even though he asks people to always state honestly

445
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:27,240
what they believe. So Socrates is often speaking and presenting himself ironically.

446
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,760
Imagine if the parent was constantly being ironic with the small child.

447
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,600
That's going to destroy the internalization.

448
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:50,040
Socrates' irony seems to thwart the function of the dialogues, which is to help us deeply

449
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:55,880
internalize Socrates, have his perspectival knowing, see the way he sees, realize the way he

450
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,120
realizes, have his participatory knowing, transform our character, our identity, the way he does,

451
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:09,400
transform our self-knowledge. But the irony seems to be undermining all of that.

452
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:19,080
Is the irony just so that Socrates or Plato can avoid political censure?

453
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:25,480
People have argued that, but most people, most of the people I've been reading,

454
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:33,400
the scholars I've been reading, saying no. Is it because Socrates can't sort of directly

455
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,160
challenge people? There's truth to that, but many of the people that he's talking with know he's

456
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,760
being ironic. And he does seem to really challenge them at times.

457
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:58,520
Yet maybe, in a deeper way, irony is actually connected to learned ignorance.

458
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,280
And in that sense, it affords the right kind of internalization.

459
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,720
I'm going to throw that out, tantalizing, and we're going to give a special place to that.

460
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,560
When Chris and I enter into

461
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,320
dialogue and hopefully deal logos about Socrates and Kierkegaard,

462
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:33,320
because Kierkegaard reflects deeply on Socratic irony. And other people, especially people like

463
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:41,240
Drew Highland, Kirkland, and his work on the ontology of Socratic questioning, they all do great

464
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:53,720
work around this. So what are some points to ponder, points that we want to reflect upon so that we

465
00:54:53,720 --> 00:55:01,000
can realize them in practice? We want to realize on one hand, the dialectic and to deal logos and

466
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,720
how it's in this reciprocal relationship with learned ignorance on the horizon of wonder.

467
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,280
We want to really let it roll around in our mind, banging and crashing like a loose cannon

468
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,440
on a ship at sea.

469
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:31,560
This problematic around Socrates, only by passing through this problematic,

470
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:40,760
this paradoxical problematic, will we have any chance of genuinely following Socrates.

471
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:51,800
And for those of you who follow other sages, Siddhartha, Jesus, Maimonides,

472
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:03,240
I put it to you that following the way of this sage has the real potential

473
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,760
to deepen your ability to be a disciple of the sage that you are most trying to internalize.

474
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:19,240
Perhaps even it would be best if you had an inner symphony of sages.

475
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:25,080
One of them can be preeminent. I do not want to call anybody away from a living allegiance

476
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:29,960
that is breathing into them wisdom and orientation towards reality,

477
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,320
that's maturing them in virtue.

478
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:47,080
But perhaps a symphony of sages not only will help disclose what any particular sage is,

479
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:57,880
but also allow you to participate in a way of wisdom that allows you to understand

480
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:07,160
not superficial, polite, liberal tolerance or ideological yelling at and not really quite

481
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:14,200
sure you know what it means, diversity or whatever word you're using. These can be good,

482
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,880
they can be bad, but I'm trying to point to something more profound.

483
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:27,320
Could you understand other people's sages such that you could enter into deal logos with them?

484
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,600
You don't have to agree with them, they don't have to agree with you.

485
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,400
You don't have to come to a conclusion if Socrates is right,

486
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:43,000
but if Socrates is right that would still be part of the best, maybe the best kind of life

487
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,160
we could live with each other.

488
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:58,520
It is superficially easy to turn away from Socrates and not orient ourselves socratically,

489
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,880
but it's actually in reality hard to turn away.

490
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:18,440
Before we move into learning our new practices, rooting and humble wonder,

491
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:25,560
I remind you to continue always doing your dialogical reflection,

492
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,120
your imaginal engagement and enactment and your study.

493
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,560
So we're going to do two practices. The first one is going to help us build on

494
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:46,280
the mindfulness practice of centering. This first practice is called finding your root.

495
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,240
It has to do with developing the right kind of relaxation

496
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,360
in your meditative practice. Many people come to meditation because they want to learn

497
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:06,680
how to relax. The problem is our normal way of relaxing is opposite to what we want to be doing.

498
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:14,600
We are making our body more insensate. We're letting our mind slowly shrink and become clouded,

499
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:22,680
somewhat confused, sort of warm and fuzzy until we lose consciousness because the point of that

500
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:28,760
relaxation is to move us towards sleep. We may not go all the way, but that is its function and

501
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:38,360
it often ends in us falling asleep. That's not what we want to be doing in a meditative practice

502
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:47,880
in which we are trying to learn and we're trying to become more aware of the forms, the formations,

503
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:56,520
the functions and the processes within our mind and body. I think of the kind of relaxation

504
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:06,920
that a martial artist engages in. So very often you'll see martial arts. I teach Tai Chi Chuan

505
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:14,680
and you'll see them take a particular stance. They'll bend their legs, they'll sink,

506
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,720
they'll sink their arms into a position, they might close their fists, they might have open hands,

507
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,800
but they do this thing. It's called rooting. Why are they doing that?

508
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:33,000
Well, they're trying to do two things. They're trying to stabilize

509
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,120
their arms, their legs, their body. They're trying to stabilize,

510
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:46,280
but they're also relaxing. So if you tense your arm like this and you touch, you'll feel there's not

511
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:52,040
very much sensation, but when you relax and you find that sort of stable point and you can relax

512
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,760
into it, you'll realize, oh wait, this is a lot. I've really increased my sensitivity. So you see

513
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:05,080
what's happening here? The rooting is a kind of relaxation that simultaneously sensitizes the mind,

514
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:12,840
makes it more alert, more acute, but also stabilizes it so it doesn't start running off

515
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:18,440
and getting scattered. So you're trying to get this sensitization and stabilization that are

516
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:25,640
interpenetrating to each other. Now think about how much that would matter in a martial art situation.

517
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,760
You're coming into a situation, there's going to be all this unexpectedness.

518
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,880
If you start flailing around because of the unexpectedness, you're easily uprooted.

519
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:43,400
If you just sort of lock in, your ability to sense what's going on and respond is lost.

520
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:49,640
You want to find this optimal relationship between sensitivity and stability.

521
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,360
Now you may be saying, well, I'm not going to get into any fights.

522
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,680
I hope that's right, by the way, because when if you're fighting, even if you win,

523
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:05,640
you lose. You lose a little piece of your soul. So what's the point of, well, the point is transfer.

524
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:12,200
Think about entering into a situation in which you want to enter into a deep dialogue

525
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,760
with another human being the way Socrates does. And Socrates is all just sort of scattered.

526
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:29,320
Then his capacity for entering into the deep conversation is lost.

527
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:36,680
But if he's just rigid and closed in upon himself and holding on to his position no matter what,

528
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:42,600
you can't move me, I am so stable. It's true, I can't. But then what's the point of the conversation?

529
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,320
How will the dialogue take? How will it lead both people?

530
01:02:49,000 --> 01:03:00,600
So you want to be sensitive yet stable, stable yet sensitive, so that you can optimally flow

531
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:10,040
within any situation, especially situations of dialogical encounter. Being able to root,

532
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:21,800
really important. So often when I'm doing these discussions that I have with people and engaging

533
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:29,800
in these Socratic practices in a way that they might not know, I'm doing Tai Chi Chuan. They

534
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:35,080
don't know it. Sometimes they do. I've had people look at one of my videos, especially when the

535
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,680
other person was sort of very interruptive or hyperactive, and they'll say, you were like doing

536
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:48,920
really good Tai Chi there. Yes, exactly. I take that as a very encouraging compliment for which

537
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:56,200
I'm grateful because I aspire to that. I aspire to be able to have that rootedness so that I'm not

538
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:03,320
easily overwhelmed, but I can also flow into the situation. I'm aware of what's going on.

539
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:11,560
In the meditative tradition, this is called sitting as still as a mountain, but as alert as a warrior.

540
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,840
This is a phrase used, by the way, within Buddhist traditions that are often committed to non-violence.

541
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:28,200
So how do we do it? How do we do it? How do we get that? And how do we learn it in a way that can

542
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,320
transfer to most of our life? Well, if you think about Taoism, you can think about

543
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:41,560
that the very famous Yang Yin symbol with the black and the white and the black dot and the

544
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:48,120
white dot and the white dot in the black area, showing that they're flowing. They have this

545
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,600
flowing balance and they interpenetrate each other.

546
01:04:50,600 --> 01:05:01,480
We're trying to get a mind that is open, yet centered and stabilized.

547
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:09,880
It can flow out into Yang, but it can also return to Yin,

548
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,360
and it has these so that they interpenetrate each other.

549
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,960
Now, how would you do this practice? Well, first of all,

550
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,440
you go through your centering practice. You do all three centers. I won't repeat that now,

551
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:33,960
but you make sure you center mind and body. You center your attention. You center your attitude.

552
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:40,760
Get centered. Now, I'm going to describe the practice to you and what it looks like,

553
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:45,240
what it feels like. Let's say you're centered. Your eyes are closed.

554
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,640
I want you to imagine a space just slightly above your head,

555
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:56,200
and then as you inhale, you're expanding in all directions, almost like you were inflating a balloon,

556
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,680
a perfectly spherical balloon in all directions. You inhale. This is you opening up. This is you

557
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:09,640
expanding your awareness, expanding your connection to the world. Right? As you inhale,

558
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:13,400
don't hyperventilate, but you inhale and you expand.

559
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,880
And then as you exhale, you let everything gather back together.

560
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:29,800
This is the end. You come in. You come in. So inhale, exhale, and then you find that spot.

561
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,480
Oh, right there. That's about right. Where it is for you is where it is for you.

562
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:41,720
Don't imitate what I'm doing. Imitate the way I'm doing something.

563
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,760
Inhale, exhale. And the last little bit of the exhale and that little space in between the breaths,

564
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:57,240
it's like I'm opening and melting and draining, and I'm coming to what's called the third eye

565
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:06,760
traditionally. And from there, but even from the center of my head on that axis, I inhale out,

566
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:21,640
I exhale in, opening, melting, draining to the throat. Inhale, remember all directions, 360.

567
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,160
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,

568
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,200
opening, melting, draining to the heart.

569
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,520
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,

570
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,120
opening and melting and draining to the solar plexus.

571
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:55,320
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering and falling back towards the center.

572
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:03,000
Yang into Yin, Yin into Yang. Do you see? Opening, melting, draining to this area called the Dantian.

573
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,400
This is eventually where you want your breathing to be when you're meditating.

574
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:13,720
Don't force it there. Let it naturally fall there over time. But here you center around there.

575
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,280
The tradition says one finger below your navel, three fingers in.

576
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,960
I don't know if that's precise, but something like that. Inhale, exhale.

577
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:36,040
And then opening and melting, draining to where that center axis is touching what you're sitting on.

578
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,040
Feel that point. Everything is drained there like a pool of liquid.

579
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:51,080
And now you let it sink into the earth. Imagination for the sake of enhancing perception.

580
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:57,800
You let it sink like the root of a tree, rooting. It's sinking into the earth, connecting you,

581
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:05,000
stabilizing you downward, but also nourishing you, energizing you, sensitizing you upward

582
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:11,640
so that you're then sitting as still as a mountain.

583
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:20,760
But as alert, as a warrior. So you center, find your three centers.

584
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,880
Go through that rooting practice. You may want to replay that sequence.

585
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:30,360
So I can talk you through it while you're doing it.

586
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:39,080
Once you feel that sweet spot, that optimal grip between Yin and Yang,

587
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:47,000
you feel rooted into the earth, then begin your meditation, following your breath,

588
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:54,280
labeling your distractions, befriending yourself. That is the rooting practice.

589
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,760
The other practice is specifically oriented towards

590
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,360
the learned ignorance that we've been talking about in this episode.

591
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:17,720
This is a practice that I call the humble wonder practice. Humility and wonder were both

592
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:28,280
central and integral to the Socratic practices, especially the practice of learned ignorance.

593
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:39,160
How does this practice work? I recommend first centering and rooting and doing two or three

594
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:48,200
minutes of basic meditation. Then bring your awareness to your heart area. You can put your

595
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,960
hands on your heart. I won't put them right there because I don't want to screw up my mic.

596
01:10:52,280 --> 01:11:00,600
Then I say as mindfully, and you've been cultivating mindfulness now, I say as mindfully as I can.

597
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,440
There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.

598
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,680
There is so much you do not know about your mind, your psyche, your body,

599
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,920
the amount of information available to you is combinatorial explosive.

600
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:26,920
But instead of keeping it as a safe, propositional thing you store over here, you're realizing it.

601
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:34,680
There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.

602
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:41,720
If you want to add all the facts about myself, feel fine. Feel free to do so.

603
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:49,640
Next, there is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the

604
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:55,320
faith. Faith, what do you mean by faith, John? I don't mean your cosmic destiny or something

605
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:02,280
written down. I mean faith in the sense that it's in the word fatal. You're born at a particular

606
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:07,960
time in a particular place. You're exposed to particular people, to particular events,

607
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:14,440
none of which you have control over, and they deeply shape you. If you do not acknowledge

608
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:21,080
your faith in that sense, your inherent finitude, then your capacity for really

609
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:25,480
realizing your self-knowledge is truncated in hamstrung.

610
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:34,840
There is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the faith.

611
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,480
Next, and they're all Fs to help you remember.

612
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,720
There is so much I refuse to see about myself because of all of my foolishness.

613
01:12:53,720 --> 01:13:00,040
All the processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially and sometimes

614
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:12,760
pervasively beset by self-deception. How often? Be honest. Really honest, please. How often do

615
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:20,280
you really, not in thought or in belief, but actually in perspective and in how you participate

616
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:25,720
in your identity, how often do you actually challenge your egocentrism and the way it might be

617
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:34,440
bias in you? Igor Grossman found, he asked people to describe a really hard problem they're

618
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:39,880
involved in. They inevitably describe it from the first person perspective without thinking,

619
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:45,800
automatic framing. And then if you say to them, and think about Socrates here, questioning people,

620
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,800
if you say to them, well, can you re-describe that problem from a third person perspective,

621
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:58,200
how your friend might see it and describe it? And will people do this? They inevitably have

622
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:04,920
an insight. They realize, oh, I didn't see this. I didn't realize that. You know that what I'm saying

623
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:13,080
is true. Think about how wise you are about other people's problems. Don't you realize it, Jim?

624
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:18,920
You're doing that same self-destructive pattern in your romantic life. I can see it so clearly,

625
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:25,800
and Jim is like, I don't really see it. And you think, ha, ha, ha, but then the roles are reversed

626
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,720
and Jim is saying to you, hey, you're doing that thing you do with relationship to your career.

627
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,880
You're doing it again. Don't you see? And you go, I don't really see it. You know that.

628
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:44,520
Part of what we're going to learn in these Socratic practices is how to be Socrates

629
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:49,400
for yourself. And that's inexorably bound up with how can we be Socrates to each other?

630
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:59,080
Okay, so back first. Let's repeat. Let's review. There's so much I do not know about myself because

631
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:08,520
of all of the facts. Realize it. Don't just state it. Live it. There's so much I shall never know

632
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:15,160
about myself because of all of the fate. Realize it. Become into deep awareness. Make it real.

633
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,720
There's so much I refuse to see because of all of my foolishness.

634
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:36,360
Realize it. And then there is so much I'm unable to see about myself because of all of my faults.

635
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:44,360
And you're probably saying, oh, this is a real downer. Stick with it. Stay with me.

636
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,080
It doesn't end that way.

637
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,280
Then you can turn your hands outward like this.

638
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:03,000
We go through the same procedure. There is so much I don't know about the world because of all of the facts.

639
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:10,920
There is so much I shall never know about the world because of all of the fate.

640
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,440
There is so much I refuse to see about the world because of all of my foolishness.

641
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,720
There is so much I am unable to see about the world because of all of my faults.

642
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:36,840
Then relax your hands back down to your meditation. And here's now where it flips.

643
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:43,960
You did the humility. And if it was just humility, it could be humiliating,

644
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:53,320
but it's not just the humility. Now as I inhale, both inwardly and outwardly,

645
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:59,720
I experience wonder, not curiosity, where I'm trying to find missing information.

646
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:05,400
And we'll talk more about this, but wonder, where I'm able to call the world and myself

647
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:13,960
into question, but in a way that is positive, that is enriching, that is growing me.

648
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:22,280
As I inhale, I wonder into the center of my mind outward to the circumference of the world,

649
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:32,200
inhaling, wondering, and then exhaling, receiving, receiving, being open to receiving from the world

650
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:36,360
and receiving from the depths of my psyche, the depths of the world and the depths of the psyche,

651
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:44,200
receiving, inhaling, wonder, wondering inward, wondering outward.

652
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:54,440
Exhale, receiving, receiving from the depths of the psyche, receiving from the depths of the world.

653
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:10,120
Do that practice with the breath at least four times. You may want to do it longer

654
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:17,320
and get the sense of the wonder and the receptivity actually interpenetrating,

655
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:25,880
mutually affording and enriching each other, so that you have wonder filled receptivity,

656
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:32,520
wonderful, wonderful receptivity. You have a profound humility,

657
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:43,000
but a transcendent wonder. That is the humble wonder of practice.

658
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:52,200
I recommend still doing your basic meditation practice, centering and rooting,

659
01:18:54,040 --> 01:19:01,640
and then do this practice, both sides of it. The humility practice and the wonder side

660
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,320
and that usually only takes about five to ten minutes. You can shave a little bit off

661
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:12,440
the meditation if you really want to limit yourself to staying under 25 minutes in total,

662
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:19,640
but try it. See if it goes the full length and it doesn't bother you if it takes maybe 25 minutes.

663
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,840
And you may be saying, John, you're going to add all these practices and I'm not going to have time

664
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:33,560
for them. I bet you do. Take out your phone. How much screen time have you put in today?

665
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:41,960
How much did it actually make you wiser? How much did it actually make you more virtuous,

666
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:46,520
connect you to yourself, to other people, to the world? How much?

667
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:55,880
I bet a significant portion of it, maybe even most of it, was wasted time.

668
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:07,560
How about fasting a little bit from your phone so that you can feed more from the fount of wisdom?

669
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,360
As always, thank you very much for your time and attention.

670
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:23,160
What is dialectic into the logos and how does one practice it?

671
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:31,720
The related question is, what is this logos that I've sort of been only referring to intuitively

672
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:38,040
that's so central to the logos? We're going to start with the first question

673
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,200
and as we answer it, it will give us what we need to answer the second question. So what is,

674
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:50,200
what is dialectic into the logos? Everything is coming down to this.
