0	5000	Humor is inherently multi-perspectival, multi-espectual, and dialogical.
5000	7480	Same thing with tragedy, right?
7480	12720	So now here, again, like I did last time, I want to do this sort of semi-provocative
12720	16000	thing with you because I can deeply trust you, right?
16000	24480	Cryptoguard to me is great evidence of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy into a
24480	30920	disclosure of how one can see the world the way Christ, the way Jesus did all, use my
30920	33920	language if that's okay.
33920	34920	Right.
34920	37240	And we see humor clearly in Socrates.
37240	39280	We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.
39280	46440	We see it clearly, right, in many great sages, like Schwangse from the Taoist tradition is
46440	48880	just humor after humor after.
48880	70400	I don't see it in the Bible.
70400	76000	Welcome back to After Socrates, episode 18, and we are continuing the series within the
76000	83880	series where I am being joined and helped by my dear friend and collaborator, Christopher
83880	91680	Master Petro, in which we are trying to exemplify dialectic into the logos, well, especially
91680	96040	the logos, and the Socratic orientation.
96040	103920	And we are also trying to bring this discussion about the logos within the logos from both
103920	109600	the Socratic-Platonic perspective and the Christian perspective by putting Socrates and
109600	112000	Cryptoguard into deep dialogue.
112000	118120	And last time we had, I thought, well, I think it really caught fire, and for me of the three
118120	126080	we've done so far, that one was the most dialogical, and the logos was there.
126080	130840	It was in the other two, but almost completely last time, and you're nodding in agreement.
130840	137360	And it was around, I think, a very important reflection about irony and paradox and following
137360	138760	the logos.
138760	146280	And so, Chris is back, and he is going to take us into something that follows on that,
146280	151800	that he's something he really wants to bring into this conversation, and I think it's really
151800	152800	opportune.
152800	153800	So, Chris, welcome.
153800	154800	All right.
154800	156800	Thanks, John.
156800	163600	So we've talked a lot about irony, and we've made side-long gestures back and forth to
163600	167960	humor quite a lot when we've been talking about Socrates and Cryptoguard.
167960	169920	Both of them are very funny.
169920	173240	Whatever else they are, they're very, very funny.
173240	178680	The role of humor in Philea Sophia, I think, is very underappreciated.
178680	180240	It's not an accessory.
180240	181760	It's not an affectation.
181760	183200	There's some necessity about it.
183200	185000	There's something actually important.
185000	186000	There's something we needed.
186200	190680	Yeah, this is a point that Anderson Todd has made to me previously as well, so please
190680	191680	be careful.
191680	192680	Right.
192680	193680	Right.
193680	194680	Yeah.
194680	199840	And so, I have with me, this is a really great book, my dear friend Patrick Kelly put
199840	202040	me onto this, The Humor of Cryptoguard.
202040	203040	It's an anthology.
203040	204320	It's edited by Thomas Oden.
204320	206760	It's basically like a compendium, a compilation.
206760	208560	You show the audience.
208560	210960	The Humor of Cryptoguard.
210960	217520	And it's basically a compilation of excerpts from Cryptoguard's body of work that, at least
217520	220320	in the estimation of Thomas Oden, are funny.
220320	221440	Either are about humor.
221440	222600	Most of them aren't about humor.
222600	225680	Most of them are just funny because he's very funny.
225680	229920	And in his irony, he's very funny because he's often indirect.
229920	236040	He makes very clever veiled references.
236040	241520	One of the reasons that he was such a find, he was such a fine polemicist, is polemicist
241520	242520	the term?
242520	243520	I think that's right.
243520	244520	Polemicist.
244520	247720	One of the reasons he was such a fine polemicist is that he was, in fact, some people have
247720	253560	remarked about him that his writing actually reached its absolute pinnacle when he was
253560	262360	immersed in a polemic and when he was trying to undress his opponent.
262360	267200	He was really quite, he had a wicked sense of humor and an ironical one at that.
267200	271360	And anyway, so I wanted to read something I think is quite apropos.
271360	275160	It's more, I think, insightful than it is funny, but you see the traces of the humor
275160	276160	too.
276160	280320	And it has, we've been talking about this idea of following the logos, how Cryptoguard
280320	281360	takes up the task.
281360	285080	He takes it up with a slightly different focus in his crosshairs.
285080	291200	But fundamentally, he takes up the task of following the logos from Socrates.
291200	294520	Right road, wrong direction, that's the title given to this excerpt.
294520	299840	And the question given to it by the editor is, does it represent a bold advance in the
299840	303160	spirit to master arguments for the existence of God?
303160	305280	It's like, oh God, God's existence.
305280	308360	What are we talking about?
308360	314320	Any qualification that claims to render the God directly knowable is undoubtedly a milestone.
314320	321160	But a milestone on the way of approximation, registering a retrogression rather than progress.
321200	326840	It marks a movement away from the paradox, not toward it, missing the point of Socrates
326840	329240	and Socratic ignorance.
329240	334440	Close attention should be paid to this, lest the same thing happen in the spiritual world
334440	339480	that happened to the traveler who asked an Englishman if the road led to London and was
339480	341800	told, yes it does.
341800	346000	But he never did arrive in London because the Englishman had omitted to mention that he
346000	351120	needed to turn about in as much as he was going away from London.
351160	355680	The metanoia, the right turning around, the reorientation.
355680	362160	I want to share a parable, and I think it's the right word because it's a story that undermines
362160	368520	itself as a narrative, by Kierkegaard, and I think it's telling that there's very few
368520	376560	people, Plato's clearly one, Jesus of Nazareth is the maestro of the parable, but Kierkegaard
376560	378640	is capable of the parable.
378640	385160	He tells this story about a bunch of geese that file into a beautiful building and sing
385160	390920	and sing about flying, but they've walked in, they sing and sing about flying, and then
390920	392560	they walk out and go home.
397560	399560	That's vintage.
399560	400920	That's vintage Kierkegaard.
400920	407560	And it's geese, and of course there's all kinds of stuff about geese.
408480	415920	You get this amazing, like the irony is coming through and the humor is coming through, and
415920	419720	you can see how that's part of his critique of Christendom, right?
419720	427240	The birds singing about flight who never ever take flight, yes.
427240	430480	And you laughed, which is the proper response.
430480	436920	So I think it's very important that we explore this.
436920	441440	First of all, there's a deep connection, like there's a continuum even I would propose
441440	449480	between, and Nago says the same, in his seminal essay, The Absurd, between humor and The Absurd.
449480	456000	And of course, Monty Python was excellent at really walking the place where they overlap.
456000	459960	So I just watched the scene again about the Trial of the Witch.
459960	460960	Oh, it's great.
460960	461960	Which is...
461960	462960	I'm duck.
462960	463960	I just always...
463960	464960	Who are you?
464960	468440	I'm so wise in the ways of science and all that wonderful stuff.
468440	481640	And so it's important because there's a sense in which a refusal to incorporate humor into
481640	488960	the following of the logos as a spiritual orientation actually innervates us with an
488960	494240	ability to have a human transcendence with respect to The Absurd.
494240	496320	That's a proposal I'm offering.
496320	502240	So first of all, and I talked about this in Awakening from the Meeting Crisis, but Nago's
502240	506280	beautiful article, at least the first half of it, where he's talking about absurdity,
506280	513960	and he says, we give all of these arguments that are supposed to both justify and generate
513960	515480	our sense of absurdity.
515480	519480	But he takes each one of the arguments and he demolishes them.
519480	520480	They don't actually...
520480	524880	Well, what you're doing won't matter a million years from now, but that's symmetrical.
524880	527960	What people are thinking a million years from now shouldn't matter to you.
527960	528960	Exactly.
528960	529960	Exactly.
529960	530960	I'm so small.
530960	534280	Well, if I made you really, really big, would you somehow find the life more meaningful?
534280	535280	No.
535280	536280	Right?
536280	540520	And he says, okay, so the arguments are after the fact.
540520	541520	And then he goes into...
541520	543720	And he gives an example that's humorous.
543720	545680	I think you remember it, right?
545680	546680	So there's this...
546680	547680	And this is...
547680	548680	Is it the call?
548680	549680	The phone call?
549680	550680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
550680	552680	From the dark before times, before we had smartphones.
552680	553680	Yeah.
553680	554680	Right?
554680	557560	And we actually had physical phones and we had these archaic devices called voice recorders
557560	559120	so people could leave you a message.
559120	560120	A what?
560120	561120	Yeah, yeah, that's right.
561120	568240	And so it goes like this, there's this fellow, he's summoned up his courage to call this
568240	573360	woman he loves, let's say Susan, and it's almost like a Bob Newhart routine.
573360	576240	And he, like, Susan, hello, don't say anything.
576240	577240	Right?
577240	579480	I just, I have to tell you, I love you, I love you, I love you.
579480	583800	And then he hears, Susan is not here right now, and you laugh, right?
583800	586320	And then Nalisa says, why is that funny?
586320	588320	And it's because we've got two...
588320	596040	And this is the thing you were saying that was like stepping into the traffic and I do
596040	597880	start going into the...
597880	599200	Getting running over by the carriage.
599200	600200	Right, right.
600680	608840	Because what you have is from that guy's perspective, right, everything he's doing is so rich with
608840	613880	meaning and he's in the first person perspective and he's trying to set up an I-Thout relationship.
613880	619280	And then the machine suddenly introduces the impersonal third person perspective that takes
619280	621080	all of that away.
621080	627840	And we're reminded that we have these two perspectives and they can be juxtaposed in
627840	631680	a way in which one undermines the other.
631680	638040	Now what's interesting is, of course, he uses that example and it's humorous.
638040	644680	When I use that example in class, I first just tell it like that and everybody laughs.
644680	649800	But then sometimes what I'll do is I'll go back and I'll get in, yeah, but really think,
649800	652920	I don't know what to say, but then I'll say it's John, right?
652920	655600	John went home and really reflected on that.
655600	660680	But all of these moments that are so first person perspective meaningful to him are in
660680	666400	this third person perspective and then you can see their faces change into, oh my gosh,
666400	670920	I've woken up at 3 a.m. and wondered, does this all mean anything?
670920	677920	And then they feel the family resemblance proximity between humor and absurdity because
677920	683920	both of them, and this is really important, both of them involve perspectival clash.
683920	689720	But here's a proposal I have for you and this is why we should talk about the two in relation.
689720	698200	I think humor involves perspectival clash that we resolve with a kind of insight.
698200	706760	I think absurdity involves a perspectival clash that drops us into participatory paradox
706760	711360	where our existence is fundamentally called into question.
711360	717080	And then I think the response there is something that, again, can overlap with humor, but it's
717080	718080	different.
718080	721680	I think the response there, the proper response is wonder, the proper response is to call
721680	726120	both your world and yourself into deep question, right?
726120	734680	And so I put it to you that I think that humor bears the same relationship to the absurd that
734680	742120	irony does to the paradox in the sense not of being one-to-one maps, but one is on the
742120	746320	same continuum and affords us and prepares us.
746320	754560	So if we do not develop the capacity of humor, of bringing perspectives, notice how I'm emphasizing
754560	759040	perspectival and participatory knowing, if we can't bring them into this and then look
759120	768560	for an insight in humor, then we are not properly educated, adduced to when we confront the
768560	775760	absurdity, not having a propositional, not even having a fully perspectival insight, but
775760	781800	something that requires a fundamental restructuring of our being, a metanoia, right?
781800	787720	So the humor prepares us within perspectival transformation for a perspectival participatory
787720	788720	transformation.
789720	790720	Exactly.
790720	791720	That's my proposal.
791720	792720	Yes.
792720	793720	Okay.
793720	799080	I think that the proposal, at least, I think I'm in total agreement, at least with the
799080	800080	gist of it.
800080	805840	I think that we can talk about exactly what the relationship is between irony and humor.
805840	810200	I think that the idea that irony, I think what you said as humor is to the absurd, what irony
810200	811200	is to paradox.
811200	812200	Right.
812200	815800	But I wasn't trying to draw an equivalence between irony and humor.
815800	816800	Right.
817680	822400	The proportion, the developmental relationship was all I'm drawing into the analogy.
822400	823400	Yeah.
823400	824400	Yeah.
824400	829840	And so I think that the crux of the move you're making is exactly right and very kick-a-guardian.
829840	836360	That humor is a kind of intercategorical response that changes and reorders our fundamental
836360	839440	stance in relation to the absurdity of existence.
839440	840440	Right.
840440	841440	Right.
841440	843040	And I think that's what you said in so many words.
843040	844040	Yes.
844040	845040	Yes.
845040	846040	Yes.
846080	847080	Humor does that.
847080	848080	No.
848080	850000	But the humor that takes us forward is wonder.
850000	857240	The humor that begins in irony, not all humor begins in irony, but some humor begins in irony.
857240	862180	The irony that begins with the vis-à-vis of those two perspectives, when they see one
862180	866240	another and are aghast at one another.
866240	871240	That irony, that particular kind that turns into humor is the kind that we're talking
871240	876460	about, which is the preparation for, which is the receptivity to paradox and the assumption
876460	880920	of the paradox happens through humor.
880920	884680	We're going to have to do a little bit of qualification about what humor, what we actually
884680	885680	mean by this.
885680	886680	Yes.
886680	887680	Yeah.
887680	888680	Yeah.
888680	889680	Yeah.
889680	890680	Yeah.
890680	891680	Yeah.
891680	892680	Because you're right.
892680	893680	There are different kinds of humor.
893680	894680	Yes.
894680	897960	And also, people kind of think of humor as just like, you know, just like when we talk about
897960	904320	irony, we're not talking about a kind of social affectation.
904320	907600	We're not talking about a temperamental accessory.
907600	912880	We're not talking about a reaction spontaneously to a situation, although cultivated irony can
912880	918640	produce ironic reactions just as cultivated humor can produce moments of humor.
918640	921320	But we're talking about a fundamental attitude.
921320	926320	We're talking about a cultivated way of being, a life view, a way of understanding and making
926320	933540	sense of the world, a way of ordering, a kind of meta-meaningful way of putting things
933540	935840	into right arrangement.
935840	938280	And we're not talking about that on a propositional level.
938280	943280	We're talking about a posture in response to the absurdity of life.
943280	948600	So when we're talking about humor, we don't just mean, I laugh at something that's funny.
948600	954080	We're talking about an attitude that we carry into a situation, not simply something that
954080	959080	we're foist with as a spontaneous moment of reacting.
959080	964240	So is this like, because Highland talks about this infinitude and transcendence, the ancient
964240	974760	sense of comedy and tragedy, where comedy is a particular way, and they're not opposites,
974760	981040	maybe opponent processing, the aspectualizations of the absurd, where what comedy does is it
981040	986680	makes you laugh at the absurd so we don't take ourselves too seriously, whereas tragedy
986680	991800	makes you wonder at the absurd so we realize that we should take ourselves seriously.
991800	992800	Right.
992800	993800	Right.
993800	995400	And you've got the playoff between those two.
995400	996400	Right.
996400	997400	Right.
997400	998400	Exactly.
998400	1004640	So the comic actually kind of helps to almost to elasticize your relationship by being
1004640	1006640	able to multi-aspectualize.
1006640	1007640	Yes.
1007640	1008640	Yes.
1008640	1009640	Yeah.
1009640	1010640	Yeah.
1010640	1011640	Exactly.
1011640	1012640	Right.
1012640	1013640	Exactly.
1013640	1014640	Exactly.
1014640	1015640	Exactly.
1015640	1016640	Exactly.
1016640	1017640	Exactly.
1017640	1018640	Exactly.
1018640	1019640	Exactly.
1019640	1020640	Exactly.
1020640	1021640	All right.
1021640	1022640	Exactly.
1022640	1023640	Exactly.
1023640	1024640	Exactly.
1024640	1025640	In a sense.
1025640	1026640	Right.
1026640	1027640	That's totally what it is.
1027640	1028640	That, those, those aspects shifts are at the core of insight.
1028640	1029640	Right.
1029640	1030640	Right.
1030640	1031640	And of course, humor when it's cultivated well is productive of insight.
1031640	1032640	Right.
1032640	1033640	Right.
1033640	1034640	Right.
1034640	1035640	Right.
1035640	1036640	You hear good humor.
1036640	1037640	What?
1037640	1038640	Sorry.
1038640	1039640	The humor we're talking about, I mean, good in that sense.
1039640	1043640	to what the really good joke is actually not found
1043640	1045320	in the propositional content of the joke,
1045320	1046960	though that too can be funny.
1046960	1051960	The joke, the master ironist who is also a humorist
1053320	1056520	finds the source of his humor, or her humor,
1056520	1060080	as the case may be, in the way they stand
1060080	1062360	in relation to the joke that they have made.
1062360	1066240	It is a characterological move that they're making.
1066240	1069560	Their position relative to what is uttered
1069560	1071560	is actually where the humor is.
1071560	1075720	It's not simply within the semantic content of the joke.
1075720	1078560	That's why I did the story of the geese,
1078560	1080160	because they're doing something absurd,
1080160	1084480	and you get the juxtaposition,
1084480	1086520	and it's like the two perspectives
1086520	1089240	in the story of the person with the voice recorder,
1089240	1091040	and it's funny there, but you realize,
1091040	1095240	but the joke's actually on us because we often
1095240	1098320	are the geese that sing about flying and never fly.
1098320	1099640	Exactly, exactly.
1101360	1105000	So in Kierkegaard, or Odin, I think makes a,
1105000	1106560	and I can't do it justice right now,
1106560	1108360	but I highly, highly recommend it,
1108360	1110960	this book, The Humor of Kierkegaard.
1110960	1113240	He makes an argument that goes something like this,
1113240	1117280	that basically, just as irony,
1117280	1119280	waking up inside the dream,
1119280	1122120	waking up within the mirage of ideality
1122120	1124560	that has us extend ourself infinitely,
1124560	1127240	but somehow within time, right?
1127240	1129040	That just as irony wakes us up
1129040	1130880	within the aesthetic stage of life
1130880	1133560	and prepares us for transition to the ethical,
1133560	1136240	for commitment, for commitment to an either-or,
1136240	1138680	instead of the impasse of either-or,
1138680	1142640	because irony prepares us to live within the bounds
1142640	1146520	of commitment, still somehow under the aspect of the eternal.
1147520	1150120	Humor, for Odin, he makes the argument
1150120	1152840	that in Kierkegaard, humor does something similar
1152840	1154920	in the transition from the ethical to the religious.
1154920	1156120	Oh, oh, oh.
1156120	1157280	That's the move he makes.
1157280	1158560	That's very, that's very good.
1158560	1161400	So that irony is to the aesthetic
1161400	1163600	what humor is to the ethical.
1163600	1164760	Right, right.
1164760	1167520	A way of waking up inside of it,
1167520	1170120	and realizing that it is not ultimate.
1170120	1172000	Right, right, and of course,
1172000	1175440	a lot of Socratic humor is that way too.
1175440	1176280	And I even-
1176280	1177560	You're corrupting the youth.
1177560	1179160	Actually, Socrates says,
1179160	1181120	I think that you should be paying before it.
1181120	1182200	Yes, exactly, exactly.
1182200	1184000	Right, and you're paying the apology, right?
1184000	1184840	I can't remember exactly,
1184840	1185680	but it's something like that.
1186600	1188440	What do you think your just punishment should be?
1188440	1189960	You should give me state sponsorship
1189960	1190800	for the rest of my life.
1190800	1191640	That's right, yeah.
1193520	1194760	Right, exactly.
1194760	1195920	So-
1195920	1196920	No, I like this proposal.
1196920	1198080	I think this is really,
1198080	1199800	I just wanna make sure I'm understanding it.
1199800	1202040	So irony sort of gives you
1202040	1204960	the requisite cognitive flexibility
1204960	1209400	to get an insight out of the aesthetic into the ethical.
1209400	1210800	And then humor,
1210800	1213880	at least the kind of humor we're talking about here,
1213920	1217120	gives you an insight out of the ethical
1217120	1218440	into the religious.
1218440	1219280	That's right.
1219280	1222680	But could tragedy also do that?
1222680	1223840	Because what I just said,
1223840	1227280	that pairing between comedy, right,
1227280	1228600	in which-
1228600	1230160	I don't think you have one without the other.
1230160	1231000	No, no, of course.
1231000	1232080	And Jonathan Miller made it famous
1232080	1233680	that when you're putting on,
1233680	1235240	as she experienced tragedy,
1235240	1236080	you emphasize-
1236080	1236920	You lean into the humor.
1236920	1237760	You lean into the humor.
1237760	1238600	And we do the same.
1238600	1239440	And we do the same.
1239440	1240280	That's right.
1240280	1241120	Because they're yin-yang with each other.
1241120	1241960	That's right.
1241960	1243640	And good drama, good dramatists know that.
1244200	1245040	In general.
1245040	1245880	Because what I'm proposing is,
1245880	1249640	we've got the humor telling us,
1249640	1252400	don't, they're saying to the ethical person,
1252400	1255120	don't take your ethical framework so-
1255120	1256680	Seriously.
1256680	1257520	That's right.
1257520	1259720	But the tragic figure is saying,
1259720	1260760	you know what?
1260760	1262040	You need to take your life
1262040	1263960	and your aspiration to virtue.
1263960	1265200	Seriously.
1265200	1266040	That's right.
1266040	1270000	And there is no algorithm for resolving that.
1270000	1270840	Right?
1270840	1271680	It's a point of process.
1271680	1272520	That's right.
1273400	1274320	We were talking about this earlier.
1274320	1275760	I just wanna bring it out
1275760	1277880	because I think it's solely also appropriate
1277880	1280480	to both Kierkegaard and Socrates
1280480	1283560	because I see them both as taking on this role.
1283560	1287240	So you've got somebody that's doing humor, right?
1287240	1290720	And what you just said about challenging the frameworks,
1290720	1292280	that's the gesture before the king.
1292280	1293280	Yeah, that's right.
1293280	1294120	Right?
1294120	1296480	You have all this authority and all the laws,
1296480	1298400	but here I am reminding you,
1298400	1300560	don't take yourself too seriously.
1300600	1303680	Because you are not what is ultimate.
1303680	1305880	Right, but you also have the prophet.
1305880	1308000	Now, I don't mean prophet in the person
1308000	1310320	who tells the future, the fortune teller.
1310320	1311520	I mean the biblical prophet,
1311520	1313320	the person that's not foretelling,
1313320	1314600	they're telling forth.
1314600	1317120	They're trying to get people to see more deeply
1317120	1317960	into what's happening.
1317960	1320080	And you have Nathan coming before
1320080	1322320	the greatest king of the Old Testament, David.
1322320	1325360	And he's a prophet and he tells them this story.
1325360	1327680	He tells them the story about this guy, right?
1327680	1329400	Who has one sheep and there's this other guy
1329400	1330240	who has all these sheep
1330920	1332920	and David's outraged.
1332920	1335600	And then he says, that's what you did with Bathsheba.
1335600	1338800	And David goes, oh, right, right?
1338800	1343800	And that's, he makes David see the tragedy
1343920	1345920	of what he has done, right?
1345920	1350120	And that's also something that takes you out of
1350120	1353600	the ethical into, so they're both.
1353600	1355120	There's the prophet and the gesture.
1355120	1359200	And then here's my proposal, both Socrates
1359200	1361480	and Kierkegaard are both.
1361480	1365240	Yes, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.
1365240	1367440	Absolutely, I couldn't agree more.
1367440	1370440	So, okay, so, okay.
1370440	1372320	So let's take that proposal.
1372320	1374240	Let's presuppose it for a moment.
1374240	1377360	And then let's talk about maybe both aspects.
1377360	1378200	Totally.
1378200	1379040	Discreetly.
1379040	1380440	And then we'll bring them back together.
1380440	1381400	Okay, okay.
1381400	1385640	Because each one, right, the tragedy reminds us
1385640	1388200	of transcendence while we're finite.
1388200	1391360	And the humorous reminds us of the transcendence
1391360	1393320	coming into the finite.
1393320	1394280	That's right.
1394280	1397400	That's why humor, the good humorous,
1397400	1399080	one of the things that the good humorous does
1399080	1400760	is show performative contradiction.
1400760	1401600	Yes.
1401600	1403720	The humorous actually, it's one of the ways
1403720	1408400	that the humorous alerts, alerts.
1410200	1412440	I just want to make clear what performative contradiction
1412440	1413320	is for, right?
1413320	1416020	So, and it's important because performative contradiction
1416020	1418180	is something that moves us outside of the propositional.
1418180	1419020	Yes.
1419020	1421180	So a classic example of a performative contradiction
1421180	1422460	is I am sleeping.
1422460	1423300	Yes.
1423300	1427140	Because that statement in so far
1427140	1428860	is how it's referring objectively.
1428860	1430140	Of course I sleep.
1430140	1431620	But when I utter that statement,
1431620	1433460	I can't be asleep in order to utter it.
1433460	1436180	So there's a contradiction between the proposition
1436180	1437780	and the perspectival and participant point.
1437780	1438620	That's right.
1438620	1439460	That's right.
1439460	1440300	Good, good, good.
1440300	1443500	And you see how that the performative contradiction,
1444500	1448100	one of the things that it does is it de-idolizes
1448100	1450900	the ethical of the religiosity
1450900	1453700	with which it is often unduly invested.
1453700	1455300	What I mean by that is this.
1456220	1460180	It shows that we can be beholden
1460180	1462100	to the custom of an ethic
1462100	1464780	while at the same time depicting
1464780	1467120	and coming into awareness of the fact
1467120	1470660	that we do not in fact live in accordance with it.
1470660	1473140	We do not live in a way that presupposes it
1473140	1476180	as the highest good and index of what is true.
1476180	1478220	So this is Jesus.
1478220	1480300	The Sabbath was made for human beings,
1480300	1481740	not human beings for the Sabbath.
1481740	1482580	Right.
1482580	1483580	Right, right, right, right.
1483580	1486660	I'll give you my favorite example.
1486660	1490460	So I had a great conversation a little while back
1490460	1491660	with Sevilla King about this.
1491660	1493420	My favorite current humorist
1493420	1495940	who is also an ironist is Dave Chappelle.
1495940	1497540	And I don't think there's anybody around
1497540	1498900	that does it better than him right now.
1498900	1500780	And he has this joke that I think
1500780	1502020	basically sums it all up.
1502020	1503860	He says at one point, one of his specials,
1503860	1507420	he goes, he's talking to an audience
1507420	1509780	that is, I would say politically speaking,
1510660	1512980	kind of generally left leaning.
1512980	1516000	As is he by all accounts, by his own admission.
1517140	1519580	But he's very hard to pin down when he does a standup
1519580	1522980	because he assumes different identities and perspectives.
1522980	1524620	And he often leads you down a road
1524620	1526380	thinking you're being set up for one thing,
1526380	1527780	but the joke comes in from the left side.
1527780	1528780	That's very quick of the guardian.
1528780	1529980	Very.
1529980	1531380	So he says at one point,
1531380	1533340	he's talking about a variety of political topics
1533340	1535700	and he's talking about gun control.
1535700	1537100	And he just sort of shakes his head and he goes,
1537100	1540500	I hate guns, I can't stand them.
1540500	1542660	And of course the audience, someone cheers,
1542660	1543860	yeah, no guns.
1543860	1546260	And he goes, yeah, but I have several.
1551180	1556180	And that to me is one of the most well-crafted jokes
1556980	1559660	imaginable because what it does is,
1559700	1561980	he means it when he says he doesn't like guns.
1561980	1562820	He can't stand them.
1562820	1565020	And he means it when he says he has several.
1565020	1566460	Right, right, right.
1566460	1569180	And what he's doing is he's,
1569180	1572780	so he's making, now there's an obvious joke
1572780	1574820	about two perspectives, right?
1574820	1575940	Clashing, yes.
1575940	1577900	A very obvious performative contradiction.
1577900	1579820	So that's the first order of the joke is this.
1579820	1581100	There's a performative contradiction,
1581100	1582180	he's woken up to it, right?
1582180	1584260	He goes, I am at quits with myself
1584260	1586820	because I espouse an ideological position
1586820	1590980	that is in accordance with a prevailing ethical framework.
1592260	1595460	And it's a framework that, at least in our ethos,
1595460	1597660	many people are aligned with, right?
1597660	1601180	And on the one hand, he realizes that there is something
1601180	1603900	about him, about the way that he lives,
1603900	1605900	the way that he behaves, that there's that variance
1605900	1608420	with that ethic, that he can't comport himself.
1608420	1613420	He can kind of, he can stand to it, he can espouse it,
1613660	1616380	but there's something in him that issues it,
1616580	1618900	that eludes it, that bucks it, right?
1618900	1620300	So that's one level of the joke,
1620300	1621620	but the higher order of the joke,
1621620	1623220	which is really the source of the joke,
1623220	1626220	is that he's standing beside himself,
1626220	1629660	looking at the performative contradiction going, Jesus.
1629660	1630940	Yeah, yeah.
1630940	1634180	And he's pointing implicitly at his audience and going,
1634180	1636020	see, see, yes, yeah.
1636020	1636860	See that?
1636860	1638900	See that, right?
1638900	1640020	Don't, do you see that?
1640020	1643420	Do you see how I am quite beside myself?
1643420	1645820	How I am quite not myself?
1646020	1647780	How I am quite at variance with myself.
1647780	1648900	Right, and these are the Christian guardian themes
1648900	1649740	you've been at, versus.
1649740	1651980	He is, he is the source of the joke.
1651980	1653540	He is its object, right?
1653540	1654660	Right, right, right.
1654660	1656900	He's showing the performative contradiction,
1656900	1658220	but he's turning in the direction
1658220	1661020	of the performative contradiction and wondering at it.
1661020	1661860	Okay, so let me, I-
1661860	1664260	And finding himself in a moment of absurdity
1664260	1665900	allowed before an audience.
1665900	1667220	So I just want to slow this down,
1667220	1668420	because this is really brilliant.
1668420	1671420	So he does this first move, which is,
1671420	1672940	as you properly described it,
1672980	1676900	how humor gets you to undermine, right,
1676900	1680300	the sort of self-righteous absolutism
1680300	1682620	of a particular ethical framework.
1682620	1686380	But then, you can't then defer to him as the authority
1686380	1688260	that is now going to be made sacred,
1688260	1690460	because he's also in the performative contradiction
1690460	1691820	undermining himself.
1692660	1694500	Oh, that's very good, that's very good, that's very good.
1694500	1697020	Right, he does something very similar.
1697020	1700460	He has a joke, he picks these remarkably contentious topics.
1700500	1703620	He has a joke about, he talks about abortion, right,
1703620	1705300	and then immediately gets an audience
1705300	1706980	on the edge of its seat, right?
1706980	1708260	Yeah, they're really a, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1708260	1709620	Even someone who's watching this right now is like,
1709620	1712820	oh God, what's he about to say?
1712820	1716420	And he says, and he goes, he stops it again,
1716420	1718460	he's talking to a relatively left-leaning audience.
1718460	1719740	And he looks at the audience and he goes,
1719740	1722900	I gotta tell you, I'm not for abortion.
1722900	1726340	There's maybe two people clapping.
1726340	1730420	And he goes, I'm not for it, and I'm not against it either.
1730420	1734420	It all depends on who I get pregnant, right?
1737940	1739580	The same thing is happening there.
1739580	1741940	The exact same dynamic is happening, right?
1742940	1746180	And then he takes it even further,
1746180	1751180	and he says, and he takes up this,
1751900	1755980	he sort of takes up a kind of a caricature
1756020	1758140	of a moralizing persona, and he says,
1758140	1761100	I honestly believe, and I think he means it,
1761100	1764140	I honestly believe that I believe
1764140	1766100	in a woman's right to choose,
1766100	1769300	and I believe that right is unequivocal and unquestionable,
1769300	1771540	and she should not have to consult anybody
1771540	1774460	except for a physician as to how she applies that right.
1774460	1777940	Gentlemen, that is fair, it's their choice.
1777940	1780860	And then he says, and ladies, to be fair to us,
1780860	1783260	I also think that if you choose to have the baby,
1783260	1785540	the man should not have to penny.
1785540	1788740	If you can kill this kid, I can at least abandon him.
1792660	1797060	Now, imagine the blood rushing to the face
1797060	1798380	adhering to something like that,
1798380	1799420	but the fact of the matter is-
1799420	1800260	So what does the audience do?
1800260	1803060	Do they laugh, or what do they do in that situation?
1803060	1805940	Well, are they laughing nervously?
1805940	1808860	Yes, I think so, I can't remember exactly,
1808860	1810820	but they're definitely laughing.
1810820	1815060	There's a little bit of, there's an intake of breath,
1815060	1818220	there's a nervous laughter, there's a mixed reaction,
1818220	1819300	but it's very uproarious.
1819300	1821620	So I wanna get this, first of all, he calls this up,
1821620	1823140	and everybody sees their commitment,
1823140	1825780	and then he calls out a contradiction, right?
1825780	1828660	And then he's also placed himself, right,
1828660	1831420	that this isn't an abstract thing, it involves me,
1831420	1833980	and I'll be egocentric when it involves me.
1833980	1834980	Exactly.
1834980	1837540	And he's got all this going, and you're going, wow.
1837540	1840700	So first of all, he is making us aware
1840700	1843580	of all of these different perspectival clashes,
1843580	1845860	and how there's a complexity there
1845860	1849700	that we are, in many instances, trying to avoid.
1850700	1852500	That's right, and what he's showing is that
1852500	1854700	this doesn't make sense, like when we put these pieces
1854700	1856380	together, they don't fit.
1856380	1857700	Don't, do you see everybody?
1857700	1859460	I'm putting all the pieces together,
1859460	1861220	I'm fitting the perspectives, I'm putting them
1861220	1862660	face to face, and they don't agree,
1862660	1865460	and they don't make for a coherent life view.
1865460	1867620	That means that something about the way
1867620	1871060	that we've, I'm editorializing him a little bit,
1871060	1873740	and that in some ways I shouldn't even be doing this much.
1873740	1876260	But for the sake of explanation, I think,
1876260	1877700	what he's doing is something like this,
1877700	1881060	is like he's putting all of these perspectives together,
1881060	1882980	and he's gathering them into this,
1882980	1886780	he's trying to squish them into the ethical frame
1886780	1890060	that we have decided to use as a way of arbitrating
1890060	1891780	the norm, and it doesn't all fit together,
1891780	1893700	and he's going, look everyone,
1893700	1895820	we are full of performative contradictions
1895820	1900820	when we try to absolutize this ethical framework.
1901100	1904420	And it doesn't fit, so something is missing.
1904420	1906860	And that removes our capacity for empathy
1906860	1911380	and understanding of people who have ethical position
1911380	1912620	other than ours.
1912620	1917620	Like if we fail to grasp the humility of our humanity
1917940	1920500	that we are caught up in performative contradictions,
1920500	1924260	it is very easy for us to defy our side
1924260	1926100	and demonize the other side.
1926100	1927380	Right, right, right.
1927380	1929700	Which of course undermines what ethics
1929700	1931060	is supposed to be doing.
1931060	1932220	Right, of course it's.
1932220	1933900	That's a huge performative contradiction
1933900	1934740	of the entire frame.
1934740	1935580	Huge, huge.
1935580	1939700	Okay, so that's just to kind of tie that back in.
1939700	1943460	Essentially what the ironic humorist
1943460	1946060	who can pit perspectival frames against one another
1946060	1949780	and fit them under the same overall marquee of normativity
1949780	1952140	that is espoused by a particular culture
1952140	1956580	does so to reveal how when you actually frame it properly,
1956580	1960780	when you try and step back and see it
1960780	1962660	in any kind of final way.
1962660	1965140	And if you try and see through that.
1965140	1966460	Ironically.
1966460	1967500	That's beautiful.
1967500	1969500	When you try and look at your ethical frame,
1969500	1972460	unironically it results in an aporia.
1972460	1975420	It becomes absurd because it does not fit together.
1975420	1978660	He's opening up exposure to the absurdity
1978660	1983140	within the ethical and in so doing gestures outside of it.
1983140	1985300	Right, and so what you're saying is
1985340	1988060	both Kierkegaard and Socrates are doing this.
1988060	1990100	And so I'm thinking of when Socrates is talking
1990100	1992580	to Euthyphro who knows what all what,
1992580	1994300	he knows what piety is.
1994300	1997860	And he's about to prosecute his father for being impious.
1997860	2000540	Right, and then Socrates says the famous,
2000540	2001660	well, what, right, right.
2001660	2003340	First of all, he gets from Euthyphro.
2003340	2004180	Well, what is it?
2004180	2006020	Well, it's to do what the gods tell us.
2006020	2007940	Well, do the gods tell us to do something
2007940	2009420	because it's good?
2009420	2011700	Or is it good because the gods do it?
2011700	2013900	And Euthyphro wants it both ways
2013900	2016300	because either way undermines his position,
2016300	2018300	puts him into performative contradiction,
2018300	2019940	and he realizes, and so what does he do?
2019940	2022180	He literally runs away from Socrates.
2022180	2023780	Right, yeah, yeah, right.
2023780	2025780	That's right, and you know what?
2025780	2028420	That's what people often do in face of the humorous.
2028420	2029780	They turn and they run.
2029780	2031140	But here's the thing.
2031140	2034300	Put all that, there's all that humor,
2034300	2035900	but where's Socrates going?
2035900	2038300	He's going to the courtroom to face his charges
2038300	2039500	that are gonna lead to his death.
2039500	2043660	Yes, yes, yes.
2043660	2045420	There's the humorous and the tragedy.
2045420	2046260	And the tragedy.
2046260	2047100	Bound up together.
2047100	2047940	Unfolded together.
2047940	2048780	Yeah.
2048780	2050380	And you really can't, because they are simply
2050380	2053500	as specializations of the same condition of existence
2053500	2058060	that has us fraught with the contradiction of our humanness,
2058060	2060780	that you can't have one without the other, right?
2060780	2062820	So this makes me think again,
2062820	2064660	of dialectic into Deologos
2064660	2066660	and when people are doing the practice.
2067860	2072500	Like, there's two ways in which it can go wrong.
2072500	2075380	We can get so serious
2075380	2079460	that we start to choke the flow of insight
2079460	2082420	that is the life breath of a Logos.
2082420	2086980	But we can also fail by not taking it seriously enough
2086980	2090500	so we do not put ourselves at stake in the practice.
2090500	2095500	So we need both the prophetic and the gesture, right?
2095860	2098420	The prophet and the comedian, right?
2098420	2099700	Both have to be,
2099700	2102940	we have to be constantly toggling between them
2102940	2104980	as we participate in the practice
2104980	2107100	because we can fail.
2107100	2110220	This is Aristotle's classic idea
2110220	2113700	about how you do the virtual engineering of a virtue.
2113700	2117900	You have constraints that limit and constraints that afford
2117900	2120980	because we're always moving between deficit and access.
2120980	2122820	We can take ourselves too seriously
2122820	2126380	and we can fail to take ourselves seriously enough.
2126380	2128540	And when we put the two together
2128540	2131380	in the practice of dialectic, we can get again,
2131380	2135860	this is yet another way of how we can lean into
2135860	2138660	and start to take up the orientation
2138660	2140260	of finite transcendence
2140260	2145060	that really is the place that gives birth to the Logos.
2145060	2147460	That's right, well said, well said.
2148460	2151020	And when we undertake that practice
2151020	2153460	to remain sufficiently mobile
2153460	2155980	to be able to migrate our perspective properly.
2155980	2158340	And also to develop the kind of,
2159860	2161540	to develop the kind of,
2162420	2164860	to socialize the process properly, right?
2164860	2167300	That's another function that the humor has, right?
2167300	2168620	Of course, of course.
2168620	2172380	Is that it helps establish the relation, right?
2172380	2175380	Right, because you can't tell a joke on your own.
2175380	2176940	A joke is inherently,
2176940	2179460	humor is inherently multi-perspectival,
2179460	2181700	multi-espectual and dialogical.
2181700	2184260	Same thing with tragedy, right?
2184260	2187620	So now, here, again, like I did last time,
2187620	2190020	I wanna do this sort of semi-provocative thing with you
2190020	2192700	because I can deeply trust you, right?
2192700	2195700	Cryptoguard, to me, is great evidence
2195700	2198380	of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy
2199580	2204580	like into a disclosure of how one can see the world,
2205340	2207340	the way Christ, the way Jesus did.
2207340	2208820	I'll use my language if that's okay.
2208820	2209740	There, right.
2211580	2214060	And we see humor clearly in Socrates.
2214060	2216060	We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.
2216060	2218020	We see it clearly, right?
2218020	2221100	In many great sages,
2221100	2223340	like Shwangza from the Taoist tradition
2223340	2225780	is this humor after humor after.
2225780	2228820	I don't see it in the Bible, in the New Testament.
2228820	2230580	We were talking about this the other day.
2230580	2232500	We were, and that's interesting.
2234420	2239420	Because we have an overwhelming presentation of the tragic
2239420	2241540	in the sense we've been talking about here, right?
2241540	2242900	It's, right?
2242900	2247300	And we also get presentation of human beings being foolish,
2247300	2251020	but it's not, but it's always filled with pathos.
2251020	2251860	That's true.
2251860	2254620	That might be true on its own terms,
2254620	2257140	although it puts me in mind, again,
2257140	2259220	of some of Kirkegaard's thoughts on the topic
2259220	2262980	because one of the things that he takes pains to point out,
2262980	2264900	and that Odin does a good job of pointing out,
2264900	2269460	is that he understands the incarnation
2269460	2272660	as being something remarkably comic, right?
2272660	2273500	Really?
2273500	2274340	Yes.
2274340	2275180	Yes.
2275180	2276340	Oh, you're gonna have to unpack that for me,
2276340	2279260	because like the sort of green shadow
2279260	2281340	of my Christian sensibility, right?
2282340	2284700	It's like getting irked, and it's like,
2284700	2286420	I'm even surprised in this moment right now
2286420	2287580	that I'm getting irked by that,
2287580	2288740	because like, what's going on in me?
2288740	2289500	But anyways.
2289500	2292540	Well, I know, and it's a kind of calculated,
2292540	2296180	Socratic heresy, for him, it's no such heresy, right?
2296180	2299860	Because for him, humor is, humor is in some sense,
2299860	2302460	the birth canal towards the serious and the religious,
2302460	2304380	to use your language from yesterday, right?
2304380	2305540	The canal.
2305540	2307940	I mean, think for a moment of,
2307940	2310100	in the same way that,
2310100	2311940	you know what makes me think there's that old like,
2311940	2313780	fable about Phaelies that, you know,
2313780	2315020	he's gazing up, right?
2315020	2316260	One of the earliest philosophers,
2316260	2317540	he's looking up at the sky.
2317540	2318380	The stars and he falls into the well.
2318380	2319460	And he's beholden into the well.
2319460	2320300	Yeah, and he falls into the well.
2320300	2321860	It's something very much like that, right?
2321860	2323580	Or Heraclitus.
2323580	2324540	Did you know how he dies?
2324540	2326460	Oh, buried in a horse manure.
2326460	2327300	Horse manure.
2328300	2329140	Right.
2329420	2330700	Right, yeah.
2330700	2333060	So you have this,
2333060	2336260	you have the impregnation of the finite by the infinite.
2336260	2338140	Okay, so you have something like that.
2338140	2339980	And for Kierkegaard,
2339980	2343780	the fact of the Son of God being born into a stable
2343780	2345540	in the lowliest of conditions
2345540	2347900	and the most impoverished of settings,
2347900	2349860	isn't simply paradoxical.
2349860	2351140	I mean, it is.
2351140	2354420	But the attitude that accompanies the paradox,
2354420	2357620	the affective manner of that paradox for him
2357620	2359540	is the comic, right?
2359540	2360380	So how do you get,
2360380	2361700	so, okay, this is,
2361700	2363100	I wanna really slow down on this
2363100	2366300	because you're really intriguing me with this.
2366300	2370900	So I get the paradoxical and how even the tragic
2370900	2375180	are so such perfect vehicles for the numinous.
2375180	2376020	Yes.
2376020	2377540	And of course, many people,
2377540	2379100	I do this, you know,
2379100	2380300	I don't consider myself a Christian,
2380300	2381300	but at Christmas time,
2381300	2384300	I insist on there being a nativity seen put up
2384300	2389220	because there's something numinous going on, right?
2389220	2391580	And so, like I say,
2391580	2395540	and, you know, auto, the fascinating and the tremendous.
2395540	2398020	And so the tragedy and the tremendous
2398020	2400620	go well together, the fascinating, right?
2400620	2403140	How does, how would the,
2403140	2404140	do you see what I'm trying to get at?
2404140	2405460	How would you,
2405460	2407860	how did the comic and the numinous come together?
2409140	2412620	Well, one of the things that the comic does, I think,
2412620	2416220	think of this physiologically for a second, right?
2416220	2417380	Like we're talking about humor
2417380	2418940	as though it's this sort of abstract thing,
2418940	2420340	but think of it like viscerally.
2420340	2422420	Think of what happens affectively, right?
2422420	2425180	Think of what happens when something strikes you as comic
2425180	2426140	and you will laugh
2426140	2428580	and you'll get that sensation in your body.
2428580	2430660	It is a way of,
2430660	2435260	I think what it does is it disrupts your categorical thinking
2435260	2437740	by re-disposing the attitude you take
2437740	2439740	in the face of something that on its face,
2439740	2442300	one taken literally doesn't add up.
2442300	2444060	But one thing that humor does is I think
2444060	2446500	it softens our attention, right?
2446500	2448780	It's a certain form of sensitization.
2448780	2453020	And I think in the case of this biblical example,
2453020	2456060	I think what it does is it helps to inoculate
2456060	2460100	the literalism that would accompany
2460100	2462860	the self-seriousness taken towards such a thing.
2462860	2464220	Oh, okay, okay, I wanna savor this.
2464220	2465300	I wanna savor this, this is good.
2465300	2469820	So the idea is if we only look at it one way,
2469860	2472420	there's a tremendous temptation to literalism
2472420	2474060	and a kind of fundamentalism,
2474060	2477060	which of course is anathema to all of this stuff
2477060	2477900	we've been talking about.
2477900	2478740	Anathema to everything.
2478740	2479580	Yeah, yeah, okay.
2479580	2482940	And so what you're doing is to remember the comic
2482940	2486020	means you don't take the literal presentation.
2486020	2489020	So seriously, so it's like the way the parables
2489020	2490820	undermined the narrative framework.
2490820	2495100	Right, right, so that they don't calcify the perspective.
2495100	2497940	Okay, so excellent, excellent.
2498660	2500620	While you were saying that something else came to mind
2500620	2502460	and I wanna see if they go together,
2502460	2505660	I was realizing, oh, but John,
2505660	2507780	you have been so inculturated to regard laughter
2507780	2509780	as always ridicule.
2509780	2513860	But the moments in which I have really laughed
2513860	2516500	have not been moments of ridicule.
2516500	2519140	They have been moments of joy.
2519140	2523940	So I grew up in Dundas and I was going to a school,
2523940	2526620	high school, and I had a really close friend.
2527540	2531020	And one day after school, we were in a room
2531020	2535700	and I said, what's that on your shelf there?
2535700	2537740	And he said, well, there's a game we can play.
2537740	2538860	And so I said, well, let's play it.
2538860	2539820	He said, okay, and then we get it out
2539820	2542220	and there were colored spheres.
2542220	2544660	And he was blue and my were green.
2544660	2546140	He says, okay, so count your spheres.
2546140	2551140	And he said, I have 13 and I said, I have 14, do I win?
2552180	2554220	And we laughed for 10 minutes after that.
2554940	2559820	Because it's all this setup and the game is just to count.
2559820	2560660	Beautiful.
2560660	2561700	Which of course it wasn't.
2561700	2562540	Beautiful.
2562540	2563380	Right?
2563380	2565620	And I'm not ridiculing him.
2565620	2567100	There's no ridicule at all.
2567100	2569460	The laughter is about, again,
2569460	2572140	a capacity to suddenly see through,
2572140	2577140	and again, to really properly move
2578660	2580300	between taking things seriously
2580300	2581620	and not taking them seriously.
2581620	2582460	Beautiful.
2582460	2583300	And there's a joy there.
2583300	2584140	Beautiful.
2584140	2585940	And I'll put these two together, right?
2587220	2588700	If we can think of,
2589660	2591820	if we can broaden our sense of the comic
2591820	2596820	to that which induces or conduces laughter.
2596980	2600180	And then if we can remember that a lot of our laughter
2600180	2602300	is not the laughter of ridicule,
2602300	2605400	but the laughter of celebration of our ability
2605400	2607700	to open up to reality.
2607700	2611380	And then if we can put that with laughter and comedy
2611380	2614420	as reminding us not to get entrapped
2614420	2616180	in an idolatry of the literal,
2616180	2619940	I'm getting a sense now of how the comic
2619940	2623460	can be part of the numinous.
2624780	2627620	So another moment that comes to mind about this,
2627620	2629600	so now this is really singing for me,
2629600	2633020	is that scene in C.S. Lewis
2633020	2635260	where the kids haven't met Aslan yet.
2635260	2639260	And they say, is he a tame lion?
2639260	2642380	And all the animals go, oh, of course,
2642380	2645140	and they're laughing, but he's good.
2645140	2646980	Yeah, yes.
2646980	2648980	So there's a punchline and there's humor,
2648980	2650060	and there's, right?
2650060	2653340	But nevertheless, the humor is in service of how numinous.
2653340	2654680	And it is ironic.
2654680	2656460	And it's ironic, I'm getting it now.
2656460	2659420	And it's so ironic about that is what the kids are saying,
2659420	2662620	what the kids are asking is, can we trust him?
2662620	2663460	Yes.
2663460	2664300	That's the question, right?
2664300	2665120	Yes.
2665120	2668340	And the irony is yes, but you have no idea
2668380	2669420	just how much.
2669420	2671300	Right, and you also don't,
2671300	2673060	it's the sensibility transcendence.
2673060	2675380	Not only do you need to have an insight into him,
2675380	2677060	you need to have a reflective insight in it.
2677060	2678900	You really don't understand trust yet.
2678900	2679740	Right.
2679740	2683300	You think of trust as, can I predict somebody?
2683300	2686100	Right, right, right, right, right.
2686100	2687220	Does what you're saying,
2687220	2690260	what you're saying participates in what is real,
2690260	2694100	unknowingly and yet beautifully and continuously,
2694100	2696620	and to such a degree that you can't begin to imagine
2696660	2697740	how it participates.
2697740	2699180	Yes, exactly, exactly.
2699180	2702100	It's, your story inspires me to tell one too,
2702100	2704980	which is, I think, a similar friend of mine,
2704980	2707740	Leslie Giley, who's one of the funniest people I know,
2708620	2711220	and who's, and incidentally, who's Catholicism,
2711220	2713500	I think is quite beautiful and quite inspiring,
2713500	2715140	quite sophisticated.
2715140	2716860	So I think of him at a moment like this.
2716860	2721860	And this was many years ago,
2721860	2722900	we were gathered together,
2722900	2726100	a few of us friends we were watching the Olympics.
2726100	2731100	And the Olympic hockey, which was a big deal in our house.
2731540	2732380	Canada.
2732380	2733220	Big deal.
2733220	2734620	The official religion of Canada.
2734620	2736260	The official religion of Canada, yes.
2736260	2737700	The ethical religion,
2737700	2739260	but sometimes it borders on the religious.
2739260	2741180	Yeah, right, well said, well said.
2741180	2744060	We can teleologically suspend the ethical for hockey.
2745260	2749700	And it was the Olympics that was actually held in Canada,
2749700	2752420	where Team Canada won the gold medal for hockey.
2752420	2754700	And so it was quite an uproarious, okay?
2754700	2755540	It's right.
2755540	2757140	It was about as sacred as it could be
2757140	2759700	without being in the proper category of the religious.
2759700	2761340	And like we said, it's pretty close.
2761340	2762420	Right.
2762420	2766180	And so we go out for a walk afterwards
2766180	2771060	and just really flesh, identifying very personally,
2771060	2772380	very closely with this victory,
2772380	2773620	which is interesting to me now.
2773620	2775940	I don't think I would necessarily have the same reaction,
2775940	2777980	but at the time it was very important.
2779260	2780660	And we're walking down the street
2780660	2783700	and there's a man who's,
2784700	2786460	what is it, one or two?
2786460	2787900	And he walking in our direction
2787900	2790220	and they're clearly evangelizing.
2790220	2792940	And I don't know what denomination they are,
2792940	2795100	but they're evangelizing and they look at us
2795100	2796900	and they sort of, they take on this sort of
2796900	2799340	kind of solicitous manner like,
2799340	2801780	oh, we're going to engage you in conversation.
2801780	2803540	And we walk closer together
2803540	2804860	and then my friend Leslie says,
2804860	2806340	have you heard the good news?
2810020	2811380	Now this is coming from a person
2811380	2812900	who's properly religious, right?
2812900	2813660	Yeah.
2813660	2816380	And yet the irony of the way that something
2816380	2819820	that is by all comparison, relatively profane,
2819820	2822940	participates in what is sacred, right?
2822940	2824780	If only by indirection.
2824780	2825620	Right, right.
2825620	2827140	It's something that is present in the humor
2827140	2828180	and present in the joke.
2828180	2829420	That's really good, that's really good.
2829420	2833900	Anyway, so I think, so this connection,
2833900	2836420	the other thing that the humorist does,
2836420	2839620	and this is again, present in what is comical about Christ
2839620	2841380	and comical about the incarnation.
2841380	2842780	Again, not ridicule.
2842780	2844700	No, comical.
2844700	2846140	Right, the comic is not,
2846140	2847980	so you've taken pains to say this
2847980	2849380	and we should take more.
2850860	2855860	The comic, comedy is often associated with cruelty
2856460	2858140	and it needn't be, right?
2858140	2859100	It really needn't be.
2859100	2861740	So when I say, and when he says
2861740	2865180	that the incarnation is comic,
2865180	2867140	he is not debasing it.
2867140	2867980	We're ridiculing it.
2867980	2868820	He's not dispraising it.
2868820	2869940	He's not ridiculing it.
2869940	2872980	He's not trying to remove its sacredness.
2872980	2877740	The profanity of the absurdity of the incarnation
2877740	2881100	taking place in the lowliest setting imaginable
2881100	2882460	in dexes to the sacred.
2882460	2886740	And he dies, the death of a criminal and a terrorist.
2886740	2889620	Right, you were talking earlier about,
2889620	2891180	in one of our previous sessions,
2891180	2895900	about the Socratic eros and how it transmutes
2895900	2898700	from the lowly and sexual, the lowly and sexual.
2898700	2899540	You know what I mean?
2899860	2903740	To the anagogic.
2903740	2904780	To the anagogic.
2904780	2907940	And we have to think of this in the same way, right?
2907940	2912340	Yes, there's a sense in which returning to the cave,
2912340	2915100	of course, makes you susceptible to tragedy
2915100	2916780	and that's in Plato's mind.
2916780	2919540	But it also has, Plato puts a comedy in there
2919540	2923140	because there's a joke there
2923140	2924500	because when he comes back,
2924500	2926300	he's stumbling around
2926300	2927820	because his eyes aren't used to the dark
2927820	2930420	and he's saying things that nobody believes.
2930420	2934740	There's a then story like that about two frogs
2934740	2937820	and one is at a pond and another one goes away.
2938780	2940380	And it comes back.
2940380	2942540	And the first frog says to the second,
2942540	2943660	what happened?
2943660	2947100	And he said, well, I saw the ocean.
2947100	2950420	And the first frog says, is it half as big as my pond?
2953180	2955980	And the first frog goes, no, it's bigger.
2956020	2958620	It's a three quarters the size of my pond.
2959860	2962180	And the second frog goes, no, no.
2962180	2964940	And then he goes, well, is it as big as my pond?
2966020	2969860	And then the second frog says, no, it's way bigger
2969860	2971420	than you can, and then it says,
2971420	2973980	and then the first frog's head explodes.
2975980	2978020	But it's the same kind of thing.
2978020	2982620	Like you realize that when the person comes back,
2982620	2985860	in some sense, and there's something
2986740	2989380	like you have to be really careful about here,
2989380	2991060	the person that comes back after,
2991060	2995820	the enlightened person that comes back, right?
2995820	2999620	Can see him a buffoon, can see him a buffoon.
2999620	3004620	Absolutely, and that's why the irony
3006260	3011260	in order to be transmuted into a religious attitude
3012300	3014680	needs to become humorous
3014720	3017880	because the, oh, wait, I see it.
3017880	3021400	That way the person takes up, oh, this is almost like Girard
3021400	3025880	about like the sacrifice undermining the scapegoating.
3025880	3030080	What the person, the sage, takes up,
3030080	3034320	allows the projection of potential buffoonery and ridicule,
3034320	3037560	and that but plays with the humor in there
3037560	3040360	in order to turn it properly back on the person.
3040360	3041520	That's right.
3041560	3045880	So this reminds me of Woodruff's discussion
3045880	3050880	in his book, Virtue, sorry, Reverence to Lost Virtue.
3050880	3055200	He says, we now think of irreverence,
3055200	3056520	and we take it as a compliment,
3056520	3060360	but he said the job, satire is not ultimately
3060360	3061840	about irreverence.
3061840	3065000	It's about getting you to find irreverence for the idol
3065000	3068320	so you get into proper reverence for the reality.
3068320	3070240	Exactly, exactly.
3070240	3073040	Irreverence toward the king means reverence to God.
3073040	3073880	Exactly, exactly.
3073880	3074720	Render unto, right?
3074720	3076560	Yeah, yes, yes.
3076560	3077600	That's exactly right.
3077600	3078960	That's exactly right.
3078960	3083960	And that's why great humorists,
3087680	3090400	that's why the irreverence of a great humorist
3090400	3093320	conceals a deep reverence for what is real.
3093320	3094640	Only so much.
3094640	3095720	It's like al-Athea.
3095720	3097640	It's concealed, but it's also revealed.
3097640	3098480	Yes.
3098520	3102960	Those who have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, right?
3102960	3106120	Yes, yes, because they stand outside of the arena,
3106120	3109960	right at its outer perimeter, out on the horizon.
3109960	3110800	That's right.
3110800	3111640	The horizon of wonder.
3111640	3113800	That's right, they stand on the horizon of wonder,
3113800	3117600	and their irreverence refers attention to that horizon.
3117600	3119880	If it is understood properly, and often it isn't,
3119880	3121560	that's why we kill them.
3121560	3123480	We kill them, literally or figuratively,
3123480	3126280	we are in the business right now of killing good humorists
3126280	3128200	as much as we possibly can, right?
3129040	3131760	Right, now think of the idea of offense, right?
3131760	3134640	Kierkegaard's idea of offense as the denial,
3134640	3138640	the refusal of the beholding gaze of agape
3138640	3141680	that reforms your relationship to yourself
3141680	3144240	and the ground of your being to take offense at that,
3144240	3147480	the idea of taking offense at that, right?
3147480	3150040	Think of the offense we have at the comedian
3150040	3153440	that has us know ourselves by some measure
3153440	3157120	that is well beyond our capacity to self-determine,
3157120	3160560	to auto-poeticize, and to manage for ourselves.
3160560	3163680	We take offense at the idea that we could be so known
3163680	3165320	and so naked by some measure
3165320	3167440	that we have not the control over.
3167440	3170160	We take offense at the idea that we do not know ourselves.
3170160	3173000	Yes, exactly, and we refuse to be known.
3174000	3175360	You shall not know me,
3175360	3177800	I shall not know myself through you.
3177800	3179360	No, I shall not.
3179360	3181240	I refuse that love.
3181240	3182600	Remember, knowing and love,
3182600	3185720	we've made this identity claim before.
3185720	3186840	I refuse that love,
3186840	3188040	I refuse your knowing,
3188040	3191000	I refuse the knowing of myself on your terms
3191000	3192920	because they are not mine.
3192920	3195640	Our offense at the comedian is in some sense
3195640	3198160	a version of our offense at the Christ.
3198160	3200720	So it's the opposite of the Socratic know-thyself
3200720	3202000	as the aspirational, right?
3202000	3204760	And it's mythology going back to that term again, right?
3204760	3209760	Okay, so again, this is deepening the point
3209760	3213680	about this sort of primary orientation,
3213680	3216680	the fundamental framing, the meta-optimal grip,
3216680	3217680	the meta-orientation,
3217680	3219760	the orientation to our orientation, right?
3219760	3222200	That we're bringing into the practices, right?
3222200	3224280	We're adding all of this nuance.
3224280	3228440	We're building the mythos around, right?
3228440	3230360	We're building a mythos scaffolding
3230360	3233080	to help people take up the orientation
3233080	3236640	that is needed for practicing dialectic into the elogues.
3236640	3238840	That's right, that's right.
3240440	3241280	So,
3241280	3246280	so what,
3250960	3254920	what do we, like, what am I trying to say?
3254920	3257000	We've hit something, just.
3257000	3258120	Yeah, no, no.
3258120	3259120	Well, there's an aporia here.
3259120	3260400	Hold it for a second, yeah.
3260400	3261920	But there's a connection too.
3266680	3270200	Because I can think of, like this stance
3270200	3273600	of being able to challenge the ethical in service
3273600	3277920	of religio, the connectedness, the relatedness.
3277920	3280320	The ratio religio, right?
3280320	3283120	And I'm thinking not only of, like we,
3283120	3288120	there are, I think the proper practice of this
3289520	3292360	within a spiritual community dialectic into the elogues.
3292360	3294640	I'm thinking of work that people like David Fuller
3294640	3297120	and others are doing of having the conversations
3297120	3298400	that we're not allowed to have.
3298440	3303440	Not because we want to espouse a racism or a sexism
3304400	3307640	or any kind of unethical behavior,
3307640	3312400	but because we want to seek beyond these ethical frameworks
3312400	3316160	a way of re-grounding the ethical in something
3316160	3319000	that it is in the service of, right?
3319000	3323280	And that we can't have these conversations.
3323280	3327520	And so what I'm thinking of is another dimension
3327560	3329280	of the scaffolding, which is,
3329280	3333360	and this is of course requires tremendous care
3333360	3336560	in both the sense of caution and taking care of,
3337600	3339400	that in addition to what we just said,
3339400	3342640	getting this finesse between taking ourselves too seriously
3342640	3345520	and not taking ourselves seriously enough.
3345520	3348680	Dialectic in the elogues also requires an ability
3348680	3351640	to talk about things that we're not supposed to talk about,
3351640	3353680	to have the difficult conversations.
3353680	3358680	And to understand that those conversations are,
3362120	3364720	they're not the end and object.
3364720	3367360	No, because the conversations are not driven
3367360	3369200	towards coming to a conclusion.
3369200	3373240	They're trying to get us both to a kind of giving birth
3373240	3375920	to ourselves that we're not capable on our own.
3375920	3379520	And so like just as an example on it,
3379520	3380440	I'm not going to get into it
3380440	3383160	because YouTube is not the place to do this,
3383160	3388160	but there is so much invocation of justice right now
3388240	3392120	and so little deologos about justice,
3392120	3395880	which Socrates and Plato and the Republic
3395880	3400880	would find so abhorrent, so deeply, deeply disgusting.
3402080	3405160	And that's what I mean about standing back and saying,
3405160	3407280	why are we invoking this so much?
3407280	3410880	And yet we pretend it's pretentious
3410920	3414560	as if we completely get what justice is
3414560	3417600	and we know it and we have it and we've got it
3417600	3418800	and there's no question.
3418800	3422280	And it's like, to me, that is also an example
3422280	3426400	of people stuck in the ethical, right?
3426400	3428640	The reduction of justice to law,
3428640	3430400	the reduction of justice to law,
3430400	3434160	whether it be formally or informally,
3434160	3436120	however we define it, right?
3436120	3438120	But that non-identity is precise
3438120	3439080	that has a non-identity.
3439080	3442960	I want to have deep discussions like this.
3442960	3446320	I want to get into deologos like Socrates does
3446320	3449440	in the Republic about justice.
3450440	3453520	And I feel like we can't do it right now
3453520	3455560	because anything that we say
3455560	3458440	that calls particular slogans about justice
3458440	3460840	into proper question for reflection
3460840	3465840	will brand us immediately as unethical individuals.
3465920	3467600	Right, well, but this goes to Beck,
3468600	3471680	and this is as you know,
3471680	3474480	we can gesture to dozens of hours of lectures
3474480	3475560	to this effect.
3475560	3477160	This is one of the consequences
3477160	3478000	of the meaning crisis.
3478000	3479040	Yes, yes.
3479040	3481380	Is that the loss of the religious category
3481380	3486380	of thought and action has resulted in the idolatry.
3487200	3488360	The idolatry of the ethical.
3488360	3492240	Right, and that's why we have pseudo-religious,
3492240	3496160	meta-meaning systems, systems that were meaningful
3496160	3497440	but not meta-meaningful,
3497440	3502000	that had no capacity to govern intercategorically
3502000	3504460	the way that we arrange meaning, right?
3504460	3506000	Like political ideologies
3506000	3507840	that have no business being religious
3507840	3510840	but are elevated and deified to that category
3510840	3512320	because they are.
3512320	3513360	They're trying to fill the vacuum.
3513360	3514720	They're trying to fill the vacuum
3514720	3518840	and it is a deeply, deeply dangerous case
3518840	3520280	of mistaken identity.
3520280	3521480	Yes, yes.
3521480	3525920	Right, and we can just like, you know, the examples are so,
3525920	3527640	they're so voluminous, they're so obvious.
3527640	3529360	We don't even need to enumerate them
3529360	3531200	but they're rife right now.
3531200	3534960	And it's because when we lose that category of orientation
3534960	3536400	we drop a tear down.
3536400	3538720	It's a pretty significant tear, right?
3538720	3541520	It's a difference of kind, fundamentally.
3541520	3545080	But it's exactly parallel, proportionally parallel
3545080	3547360	to the person living the aesthetic life
3547360	3551360	who, right, tries to.
3551360	3552720	The Puerta Ernest, yeah.
3552720	3555320	Yeah, yeah, right, who's trying
3555320	3556920	to find a spiritual, right?
3556920	3559720	He's even trying to, there's a vacuum
3559720	3561120	of ethical orientation.
3561120	3562880	Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.
3562880	3566720	Well, as you pointed out, I think very wisely yesterday
3566720	3568120	when we talk about the aesthetic
3568120	3570760	and it's a rough mapping but I think it's very apt.
3570760	3573200	It's to the aesthetic and the ethical and the religious
3573200	3575360	as the child is the adult, the adult is the aesthetic.
3575360	3577040	Right, the child is the aesthetic,
3577040	3581880	the adult is the ethical and the sage is the religious.
3581880	3584240	And incidentally, I mean, I think we've made this clear
3584280	3586400	but just in case there is necessary
3586400	3589000	and independent value in each of these stages, right?
3589000	3589840	Of course.
3589840	3592400	We don't want to lose, we don't want to lose
3592400	3595080	the ideality of playfulness that belongs
3595080	3596240	to the province of the child.
3596240	3597480	There's a reason that Kierkegaard
3597480	3599800	really got along with kids, right?
3599800	3602840	And in Jesus, you have to be like children
3602840	3603680	to enter the kingdom.
3603680	3605120	That's right, that's right.
3605120	3608480	Our development comes through serious play, right?
3608480	3611480	Which children, of course, exemplify, right?
3611480	3614240	And of course, there is tremendous value
3614240	3616960	to the ethical, right?
3616960	3621880	And you see the great figures, like Socrates,
3621880	3624360	criticizing the laws of Athens
3624360	3628280	but refusing to leave when they have pronounced his death.
3628280	3631480	Jesus saying, I haven't come to throw away the law
3631480	3633480	but to fulfill it, right?
3633480	3635560	And you get these constant,
3635560	3636520	where you get St. Paul.
3636520	3637880	Once again, the paradox of that.
3638160	3642640	Right, wrestling between law and love, right?
3642640	3646480	Or the parable of the prodigal son,
3646480	3649040	where if you, like the prodigal son for me
3649040	3651320	is I come back to it again and again
3651320	3654120	because if you land on any one of the identities
3654120	3656800	and absolutize it, you don't get the parable.
3656800	3660560	And that's the classic, and that is that by definition,
3660560	3663640	I think by Schindler's definition is what mythology is,
3663760	3667920	that the denial of the logos, the hate of the logos
3667920	3670160	is mistaking the part for the whole.
3670160	3673200	Mistaking any, the part of any one of these perspectives,
3673200	3675000	the part of any one of these stages
3675000	3676560	as being absolute in itself,
3676560	3679800	rather than being something that participates in what is.
3679800	3680960	And let's add the two things to it.
3680960	3682360	They go exactly with it.
3682360	3684720	The mythology is also that the logos
3684720	3687440	is always instrumental and in service of something else.
3687440	3689280	Yes, but what is all of this for?
3689280	3691920	What if it's for what it is, right?
3692160	3696520	It's about the abundant life, the life worth living.
3696520	3699040	And then the other is, well, let's get to a conclusion.
3699040	3701080	Let's get to the bottom line, right?
3701080	3702240	Give me something final.
3702240	3705080	What's the bottom line in the parable of the prodigal son?
3705080	3706040	You tell me.
3706040	3708360	What's the bottom line in the crucifixion?
3708360	3711360	What's the bottom line in Socrates' trial?
3711360	3714040	Like, you're not understanding it.
3714040	3715480	Exactly, exactly.
3715480	3719400	And so mythology is also that which has us take offense
3719440	3721280	at the possibility of agape,
3721280	3723240	which is a form of knowing and being known
3723240	3725880	that is inexhaustible and is not brought to anything
3725880	3728200	so final as what is so desired.
3728200	3730840	Right, and therefore it is also,
3730840	3732760	and this is one of the great, to my mind,
3732760	3734480	one of the reasons why I think Christianity
3734480	3735640	hasn't profunded it yet,
3735640	3737320	which is the deep co-identification
3737320	3739960	of agape and the logos, right?
3739960	3742560	Because the mythology is not only the foreclosure
3742560	3745600	on agape, it is the foreclosure, therefore also,
3745680	3749360	of the logos, and we have to understand them.
3749360	3752000	And I think in this paradox that he talks about,
3752000	3757000	in this paradox, they are co-identified.
3757440	3761000	So there's a way in which, right,
3761000	3763760	and I'm not, I don't propose we resolve it right now,
3763760	3768760	but what I'm seeing, again, to help get people oriented,
3768880	3772680	is I'm seeing this interplay between comedy and tragedy,
3772680	3774640	not taking ourselves too seriously.
3774640	3777000	In order to take ourselves seriously.
3777000	3779160	Right, right, and then there's also this interplay
3779160	3781800	between logos and agape, and they're like,
3781800	3783920	I see them as these opponent things,
3783920	3786280	and then there's the nexus between them,
3786280	3788400	and that's the place we wanna be in
3788400	3790240	when we are exercising the practice.
3790240	3792800	Yes, and it is not a place that we can articulate.
3792800	3794080	No. It is ineffable.
3794080	3796080	No, no, but what we can do, we can live in it.
3796080	3799000	Yeah, we can live it, and we can triangulate ways
3799000	3802640	in which, like Tillich, in which we can find the tonos,
3802640	3803880	and we can find the tonos,
3804080	3807400	and we can find the tonos between the different, right,
3807400	3810040	and where they touch on each other and bear on each other.
3810040	3810960	That's right.
3810960	3812400	Yeah.
3812400	3813480	I think this was wonderful.
3813480	3815240	I think this was fantastic.
3815240	3817240	So thank you so, so much.
3817240	3818200	This was excellent.
3818200	3819040	It was.
3819040	3821000	Can I maybe just finish us off with one more?
3821000	3822480	Oh, please.
3822480	3827400	Because this one is, this one is a little less obvious,
3827400	3829040	but I think all the better for it.
3829040	3830000	So bear with me.
3830000	3831000	Okay. Bear with me.
3832120	3832960	Bear with me.
3834880	3837920	Instantly transforming oneself,
3837920	3839520	how to become a jellyfish.
3842520	3843360	And the question is,
3843360	3845760	how does the self acquire its own selfhood
3845760	3850040	if it is merely a receptacle for absorbing external values?
3851560	3855200	There was a creature about which I fall into reverie rather often.
3855200	3857000	It is the jellyfish.
3857000	3859200	Have you noticed how this gelatinous mass
3859200	3861280	can flatten itself into a plate
3861280	3864560	and then slowly sink, then rise so still and firm
3864560	3866800	that one would think one could step on it?
3867800	3871520	Now notice, now it notices its prey approaching,
3871520	3872920	then it funnels into itself,
3872920	3875520	becomes a pouch and sinks with prodigious speed,
3875520	3880200	deeper and deeper with its speed snatching in its prey.
3880200	3883720	Not into its pouch, for it does not have a pouch,
3883720	3888640	but into itself, for it is itself a pouch and nothing else.
3889640	3891640	It is so able to contract itself
3891640	3895640	that one cannot imagine how it could possibly extend itself.
3896640	3898640	It is just about the same with you.
3899640	3901640	And you must forgive me that I have not had
3901640	3904640	a more beautiful creature with which to compare you.
3904640	3907640	And also that you perhaps can hardly keep from smiling
3907640	3910640	at the thought of yourself as nothing but a pouch.
3912640	3914640	That is so consonant with everything,
3914640	3917640	like we've been talking about and also, you know,
3918640	3925640	being tracking Socrates and trying to follow the logos.
3925640	3928640	And it also reminds me of L.A. Paul's stuff
3928640	3930640	about people offering to turn you into a vampire
3930640	3933640	and you can't possibly know what that is like.
3934640	3936640	But the humor gets you into the serious play
3936640	3938640	between the perspectives.
3938640	3941640	That was perfect for ending it.
3942640	3943640	Thank you so much.
3945640	3946640	Thank you, everyone.
3947640	3949640	For your time and attention.
3949640	3950640	Take good care.
3950640	3952640	Kierkegaard seems to be also presenting it
3952640	3953640	as a positive and good thing,
3953640	3956640	but he's suffering it in this profound way.
3956640	3958640	This is what I'm hearing you saying.
3958640	3960640	This is almost ripping him to pieces.
3960640	3962640	And yet in Socrates,
3962640	3966640	it seems to be sitting there harmoniously together.
