00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Educing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself, that is to be on

00:09.400 --> 00:12.160
the horizon of wonder.

00:12.160 --> 00:19.480
It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question so a

00:19.480 --> 00:43.720
new self in a new world can deeply be born.

00:43.720 --> 00:46.920
Welcome back to episode 2 of After Socrates.

00:46.920 --> 00:51.920
First time we looked at four ways we are after the way of Socrates and we also reviewed

00:51.920 --> 00:56.120
the basic format of the series.

00:56.120 --> 01:02.280
Now let's continue being after Socrates.

01:02.280 --> 01:09.080
Right now at the beginning as we orient ourselves to find our way, let's follow Socrates.

01:09.080 --> 01:15.600
In order to follow Socrates we have to understand how he understood himself and this is going

01:15.600 --> 01:20.440
to be perplexing.

01:20.440 --> 01:29.760
Socrates' self-knowledge, he found himself and frequently described himself as a tipos,

01:29.760 --> 01:39.360
not belonging to any particular category, like our word atypical but deeper, more powerful.

01:39.360 --> 01:45.560
He explicitly refers to himself sometimes and Plato has other characters refer to him

01:45.800 --> 01:53.840
in terms of monsters, as monstrous, he's like a satyr, he's like a stingray, he compares

01:53.840 --> 01:59.800
himself to a titan, many different kinds of monsters, this is a recurring thing across

01:59.800 --> 02:04.320
many of the dialogues.

02:04.320 --> 02:16.200
Namely, he describes himself as metaxu, as fundamentally in between, in between the human

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
and the divine.

02:17.200 --> 02:23.080
I'm going to come back to that because Socrates never thinks that he becomes anything other

02:23.080 --> 02:29.960
than a human being, so he says we like him, at least he's challenging us to realize that

02:29.960 --> 02:39.840
we like him, are somehow in between human finitude and the transcendence of the divine.

02:39.840 --> 02:47.080
Drew Highland, excellent book and we'll come back to it, talks about finitude and transcendence

02:47.080 --> 02:50.680
in the platonic dialogues.

02:50.680 --> 02:56.240
Socrates does something really interesting when he says that he's metaxu, he says so

02:56.240 --> 03:08.200
is eros, eros isn't a human but it's a transhuman force, it's not a god, eros is a daemon, d-a-e-m-o-n,

03:08.200 --> 03:18.760
not a daemon but a daemon, a being that is between and therefore mediates and unites

03:18.760 --> 03:24.040
the human and the divine, just think about it, isn't there something really insightful

03:24.040 --> 03:27.280
in that about love?

03:27.280 --> 03:40.200
So Socrates he understands himself as fundamentally liminal, he's within and without, sort of

03:40.200 --> 03:46.280
fits our categories but he doesn't, he's monstrous, the monster takes the normal categories

03:46.280 --> 03:55.800
and distorts them in a way that is startling and challenging and disruptive.

03:55.800 --> 04:10.640
Somehow Socrates transcends our normal framing in a way that is challenging and even at times

04:10.640 --> 04:14.760
threatening.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.800
How is Socrates within and without, how is he liminal, how is he monstrous in a way that's

04:20.800 --> 04:27.880
constantly challenging and threatening to us but nevertheless beneficial to us?

04:27.880 --> 04:37.920
And how does he do this while never claiming to be anything other than a mortal?

04:38.920 --> 04:47.920
A mortal doomed to die human being.

04:47.920 --> 04:54.400
So Socrates enters into these intensive in terms of how he's involved with people but

04:54.400 --> 05:01.680
extensive in terms of how much scope they take in, how much they zoom in and zoom out,

05:01.840 --> 05:09.680
probative conversations with people.

05:09.680 --> 05:15.480
And in these conversations questioning, not just questions, questioning, it's even better

05:15.480 --> 05:22.600
perhaps to hear a related word to questioning, questioning.

05:22.600 --> 05:28.360
Questioning plays a central part rather than concluding.

05:28.360 --> 05:36.160
These exploratory dialogues are often centered on what is virtue, what is wisdom, related

05:36.160 --> 05:42.280
things, what is knowledge, what is goodness, what is real?

05:42.280 --> 05:44.360
And these are questions and this is the importance.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.200
These are questions we cannot ignore, this is why we cannot ignore Socrates, we can't

05:48.200 --> 05:53.280
ignore these questions, we can pretend to ignore them, but then we're just giving answers

05:53.280 --> 06:01.440
to these questions given to us implicitly, unconsciously, automatically and we reactively

06:01.440 --> 06:10.480
acting them out rather than acting on principle.

06:10.480 --> 06:29.080
Yet these dialogues frequently and frustratingly and profoundly inconclusively, inconclusively,

06:29.080 --> 06:35.280
everybody including, really hear that, including Socrates, they've been talking about courage

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
at the end of it.

06:36.280 --> 06:46.680
Everybody says, I don't know what courage is, including Socrates.

06:46.680 --> 07:02.080
Socrates claims to have achieved human wisdom in that he, by practicing this kind of dialogue,

07:02.080 --> 07:11.880
has come to know that he does not know and we go, what, that's it, we're all ignorant,

07:11.880 --> 07:21.640
I know, there's tons I don't know, well how is this, what's going on?

07:21.640 --> 07:27.760
Socrates doesn't mean that generic belief.

07:28.760 --> 07:36.680
Existentially in the situation, specific realization in both senses of the word, it's a palpable

07:36.680 --> 07:44.440
reality and one is coming to a deep understanding awareness of how one is ignorant in this situation

07:44.440 --> 07:53.280
in a way that matters because one has been pretending deeply, unconsciously, automatically

07:53.280 --> 08:00.960
reactive to know, know both the situation and know oneself relevant to and relative

08:00.960 --> 08:02.640
to that situation.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.200
This is a profound kind of realization.

08:05.200 --> 08:12.120
It requires disciplined mindfulness.

08:12.120 --> 08:23.920
He has cultivated, and this is going to become an important phrase, he has learned, learned

08:23.920 --> 08:24.920
ignorance.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.720
In fact, when I say learned ignorance, I want you to hear both pronunciations, learned and

08:29.720 --> 08:30.720
learned.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.360
He has learned ignorance.

08:33.360 --> 08:46.720
He has become aware of his ignorance in a way that makes a huge difference to specific

08:46.720 --> 08:54.400
actual concrete situations.

08:54.400 --> 08:59.560
So let's explore the dynamics of this a little bit better.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.480
So we have, on one pole, we have conversation.

09:03.480 --> 09:07.200
Socrates is engaging in a conversation.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.160
I want you to start to get a feel for this.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.480
I want you to think of those conversations you've been in, where you're asking each other

09:13.480 --> 09:17.320
questions and you're not giving sort of pat answers.

09:17.320 --> 09:22.760
You're really opening up, a person's opening up and you're opening up, you're reciprocally

09:22.760 --> 09:27.160
opening, and the conversation starts to take on a life of its own.

09:27.160 --> 09:34.200
And it's not wandering aimlessly, it's wandering fruitfully, and you both find you're getting

09:34.200 --> 09:41.360
to places and having insights, realizations that you couldn't have had on your own.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.280
When the conversation comes to an end, you say, that was one of the greatest moments

09:46.280 --> 09:50.760
of my life.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.120
Socrates is like that.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.480
He talks about it.

09:57.480 --> 10:00.880
You may not get that sense when you're reading the dialogues, because it seems like there's

10:00.880 --> 10:03.360
a lot of conflict and argumentation.

10:03.360 --> 10:11.240
But Socrates says, in more than one place, but in one space specifically, he says, I'm

10:11.240 --> 10:16.560
willing to follow the logos, dia logos, and we're going to come back to, what is this

10:16.560 --> 10:18.040
logo he's talking about?

10:18.160 --> 10:23.640
But he's willing to follow the logos wherever it goes, like the wind.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.160
Isn't that amazing?

10:28.160 --> 10:31.160
The wind.

10:31.160 --> 10:38.160
It seems to have a life of its own, but the wind, spiritus, wind, inspiration, aspiration,

10:38.160 --> 10:39.920
spirituality.

10:39.920 --> 10:45.360
When Jesus is talking to Nicodemus and telling him he has to be born again, he talks about

10:45.360 --> 10:48.320
the wind is like, the spirit is like the wind.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.760
It comes and goes as it would, and you know where it's coming from, and you don't know

10:52.760 --> 10:57.200
where it's going to, but you can get caught up in it and follow it and breathe it and

10:57.200 --> 11:01.480
been inspired to aspire by it.

11:01.480 --> 11:07.480
That's one pole.

11:07.480 --> 11:16.560
It's important to realize that Socrates is being just as surprised by the way the conversation,

11:16.560 --> 11:18.480
the dialogue, is going.

11:18.480 --> 11:25.880
He's just as much surprised by the dia, by way of, by means of logos, the dia logos as

11:25.880 --> 11:32.200
anyone else participating, and you'll see how much he comes to deeply value this.

11:32.200 --> 11:38.560
He's not experiencing this just as rough, you know, back and forth adversarial thing.

11:38.560 --> 11:43.200
There's a deeper thing going on, and you'll see this in what he says about this practice.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.240
Now, this is one pole.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.880
The other pole is this learned ignorance.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.680
You say, what's, like, why is that valuable?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.560
Well, think about it.

11:56.560 --> 12:05.240
What the dia logos is doing is it's taking you to the horizon of wonder.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.800
Securiosity is when I don't know something, I need that information, there's a gap in

12:08.800 --> 12:12.280
my knowledge, hey, look, this fills it, and now I'm done.

12:12.280 --> 12:16.480
I have what I need.

12:16.480 --> 12:23.680
It's very much as Fromm would say in the having mode, but wonder, at least the way Fuller

12:23.680 --> 12:29.960
and others argue about it, wonder is the being mode.

12:29.960 --> 12:34.520
You come to the horizon, now think about the horizon, you can actually never reach it,

12:34.520 --> 12:40.620
but there's a horizon, and at the, when you look at the horizon, you have a sense of what

12:40.620 --> 12:46.880
is within your understanding, but how it is, how it is on the cusp of what is beyond your

12:46.880 --> 12:54.440
understanding.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.200
The horizon of wonder.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.040
Socrates famously said that wisdom begins in wonder.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.320
Why, what's going on?

13:02.320 --> 13:06.880
In wonder, you're not filling the hole.

13:06.880 --> 13:11.000
You're opening it up to the horizon.

13:11.000 --> 13:20.400
You are calling yourself and the way you have framed the world into question, but in a way

13:20.400 --> 13:27.160
you feel called to, in a way that is somehow beautiful to you, that is drawing from you.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.520
This is, the word for it to draw forth is educe, this is where we get the word education

13:31.520 --> 13:33.760
from, but think of it, it's a different kind of education.

13:33.760 --> 13:39.040
This isn't here's, the knowledge you need, and so you can service the workplace and the

13:39.040 --> 13:42.040
market until you die, and otherwise meaning was death.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.360
They don't mean education like that.

13:44.360 --> 13:53.440
You mean inducing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.400
That is to be on the horizon of wonder.

13:57.400 --> 14:04.760
It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question, so a

14:04.760 --> 14:10.560
new self in a new world can deeply be born.

14:10.560 --> 14:17.080
That is what's going on in this process.

14:17.080 --> 14:23.480
So notice, there's a discipline.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.800
What does the word discipline mean?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.200
It means to follow.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.960
It means to track.

14:29.960 --> 14:37.960
It means to follow and track so that you are transformed by that following.

14:37.960 --> 14:48.560
There's a discipline to following the logos, dia logos, letting it call you into question,

14:48.560 --> 14:52.880
letting it call your world into question, so that you and the person you're in dialogue

14:52.880 --> 14:57.840
with are giving birth to yourselves, mutual midwiving.

14:57.840 --> 15:06.240
Socrates was clear that he was not only examining others and helping them give birth to themselves.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.920
He repeatedly emphasized it was reciprocal.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.360
He was also examining himself and giving birth to himself.

15:13.360 --> 15:18.160
They were mutually interwoven.

15:18.160 --> 15:32.400
So the discipline of following the logos that allows us this mutual midwifing allows the

15:32.400 --> 15:48.520
logos to take on a life of its own and thereby transform the way we are living.

15:48.520 --> 15:57.880
Socrates, and it's often talked about using this practice called unlinkus, this questioning

15:57.880 --> 16:01.680
and answering and probative.

16:01.680 --> 16:07.560
And as we'll see, the unlinkus slowly in the hands of Plato becomes dialectic.

16:07.560 --> 16:13.720
This disciplined following of the logos, this mutual midwifing and affording of the logos

16:13.720 --> 16:23.440
to take on a life transforming life of its own.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.680
So we've got a discipline.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.840
So there are a set of practices.

16:29.840 --> 16:39.080
Let's call those with Plato dialectic, this is not Hegel's dialectic, this is a way of

16:39.080 --> 16:46.840
structuring dialogue in a disciplined manner so that it will take on the features of the

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
logos.

16:47.840 --> 16:54.040
So there's a practice, there's something we can do dialectic, it's doing this mutual

16:54.040 --> 17:03.720
midwifing and affording the presencing of the living logos.

17:03.720 --> 17:12.360
That practice can result in a process that we do not make.

17:12.360 --> 17:19.160
It's a process between us and between us and the world, the taxu, and it's like eros,

17:19.160 --> 17:27.080
it's like love, especially in the platonic sense.

17:27.080 --> 17:36.120
You don't make love, well we do say you make love, but what I mean by that, let's think

17:36.120 --> 17:44.200
of it as analogous, oh it's a kind of love itself too, in fact it's a kind of platonic

17:44.200 --> 17:45.200
eros.

17:45.240 --> 17:50.360
Platonic love, friendship, profound friendship.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.120
You can't just make somebody your friend.

17:53.120 --> 17:59.920
You can't say you're my friend now, that's it, I've decided it, I make it so.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.880
That's in fact, that's going to go nowhere, in fact it's probably going to have the opposite

18:02.880 --> 18:03.880
result.

18:03.880 --> 18:09.880
You can't just sort of passively wait around, someday a friend will come, somebody will

18:09.880 --> 18:14.880
come up to me and say I'm your friend, probably not.

18:14.880 --> 18:24.360
That's why we use metaphors of like falling in love, growing in love, we participate in

18:24.360 --> 18:25.360
it.

18:25.360 --> 18:34.480
So it's a practice we can do, we can discipline ourselves, to follow the logos, to mutually

18:34.480 --> 18:40.760
midwife, to afford the logos taking on a life of its own.

18:40.760 --> 18:50.400
That's dialectic, but the process of the logos is not something we do, it is something we

18:50.400 --> 18:58.840
participate in profoundly, the way we participate in love, friendship, it is between us and

18:58.840 --> 19:02.160
between us and the world.

19:03.160 --> 19:14.040
The practice of dialectic, the process of the logos, that's why Fowler put in both

19:14.040 --> 19:25.640
the logos and dialectic in the classical tradition, but there's also a state, here's

19:25.640 --> 19:31.120
the the logos and learned ignorance and they're mutually affording each other, the the logos

19:31.120 --> 19:40.000
gets us to the horizon of wonder and that opens us up and makes it possible for us to

19:40.000 --> 19:44.640
reciprocally open with each other and reciprocally open with the world and then that affords the

19:44.640 --> 19:55.760
logos and the the logos affords learned ignorance and we cycle the practice of dialectic, the

19:55.760 --> 20:04.360
process of the logos and the paradoxical state of learned ignorance.

20:08.360 --> 20:15.760
But is not all of this problematic, you should say to me, you should say, this looks like

20:15.760 --> 20:22.760
you know a lot of knowledge, a lot of learning and Socrates is claiming, right, that all

20:22.760 --> 20:29.680
he knows is that he does not know. That's actually not accurate. Many people put that

20:29.680 --> 20:33.680
talk, all that Socrates ever said is that he know that he know, no, no, he doesn't

20:33.680 --> 20:39.080
say that. He said that's what his wisdom consists in. Socrates actually claims to know a bunch

20:39.080 --> 20:44.120
of things. So first of all, we have to modify it, but then we'll come back to your point

20:44.120 --> 20:50.360
because you are making a good point in posing that problem. What does Socrates claim to know?

20:50.440 --> 20:57.400
He famously claims to know erotica. He knew he knows about the erotic things. That doesn't

20:57.400 --> 21:02.320
mean he's really good in bed or he just knows about sex. He's talking about eros in a much

21:02.320 --> 21:08.800
more comprehensive sense about how we seek to bind ourselves to things. And this seems

21:08.800 --> 21:17.360
inherent to us. We seem by nature to be looking for things other than ourselves to complete

21:17.360 --> 21:22.040
us. And notice how that gets us into self-transcendence. I'm looking for something that's other than

21:22.040 --> 21:28.360
me to become me so that I am more than me, but completed as me. And so as you think about

21:28.360 --> 21:34.360
this, you start to go, oh, how does that make sense? Hold on to that vertigo. We're going

21:34.360 --> 21:49.080
to come back to it. Socrates knows how to track eros. Do you? Well, I know what it's... Yeah,

21:49.080 --> 21:55.680
I know you know what it's like to feel eros. I do too. But can you feel eros in a way so

21:55.680 --> 22:02.080
that you don't do all the self-deceptive, self-destructive things you've done because

22:02.080 --> 22:08.760
of that feeling? Because when you track, you're following, but you're also able to know and

22:08.760 --> 22:17.080
see where something is going to go. When you're tracking a storm and following it, you're

22:17.080 --> 22:23.280
trying to predict where it's going to go so you can avoid being overwhelmed by it. Socrates

22:23.280 --> 22:31.320
knows how to track eros. He knows how to follow the trail of signs. He knows how to properly

22:31.560 --> 22:42.560
apprehend and appreciate the significance of eros. He knows what to care about. He would do this

22:42.560 --> 22:46.680
provocatively. As I already said, he would go into people and he'd say, why are you spending so

22:46.680 --> 22:53.880
much time on your hair and your clothing and how you smell? And so little time on your psyche,

22:54.120 --> 23:01.160
so little time on your mind and your soul and your character. You go, yeah, why am I?

23:03.320 --> 23:07.480
Socrates would walk into the marketplace and say, look at all the things I don't need.

23:09.880 --> 23:18.280
You go, oh, right. Why don't I do that? That's the socratic question. It's a question about

23:18.280 --> 23:25.160
Socrates that reverberates back and becomes a question, a wondering about yourself and the world

23:26.760 --> 23:31.160
that you live in. So Socrates knows erotica.

23:34.680 --> 23:42.120
How can we know this? How can we do this in practice? How can we realize it in practice?

23:43.080 --> 23:51.480
We will come back to this. Socrates also, and he states it very confidently, he knows the difference

23:51.480 --> 23:59.880
between belief or opinion and knowledge. He knows it. Now, how can he know this when he claims to

23:59.880 --> 24:07.640
know that he doesn't know anything? He actually claims to know a lot of things.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.800
He knows how to do geometry with Domino.

24:19.240 --> 24:31.160
He'll often say he knows how this practice works, how this art, or actually more specifically,

24:31.160 --> 24:35.480
more technically, how this technique, how this particular kind of expertise works.

24:42.120 --> 24:50.600
See, what Socrates means is he knows how to track, he knows how to follow, he knows how to quest

24:50.600 --> 24:54.680
after knowledge in a way that's not just haphazard.

24:58.040 --> 25:07.880
That doesn't mean he's got there. He knows what virtue is in a sense the way you know by being.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.680
He certainly doesn't claim to have wisdom.

25:17.320 --> 25:25.400
But he doesn't claim to be completely ignorant of it. He claims to be a lover of wisdom. There's

25:25.400 --> 25:30.440
the connection to love, except this time it's not eros, and this is important. It's philea.

25:31.080 --> 25:35.240
It's the kind of love between friends, or even more importantly, fellowship,

25:35.880 --> 25:39.880
people working in concert together. He knows how to work with people.

25:43.080 --> 25:52.680
In order to be properly oriented towards wisdom. When you really love your friend,

25:53.400 --> 25:57.640
when you really love your romantic partner, have you got them?

26:00.120 --> 26:07.080
Like, I figured you out. We're done. I don't need to learn it. I got it. We're finished.

26:08.040 --> 26:12.120
I've got the perfect framing for you that holds you perfectly in place,

26:12.120 --> 26:16.040
reveals everything that there is possibly to know, but I've got you. Yep.

26:18.840 --> 26:23.960
I say to you, in fact, if you say that, that's a strong predictor that your relationship is actually over.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.040
What are you actually?

26:33.080 --> 26:35.880
You have a faithfulness to this person.

26:37.400 --> 26:43.800
You know how to follow them, to track them. They're going to change, and you know how to

26:43.800 --> 26:48.040
dash. You don't know where they're going. You don't know what kind of changes you're going

26:48.040 --> 26:57.000
to go through, how you're going to dance with them. But you keep teaching each other how to

26:57.000 --> 27:03.160
follow each other. And the person, although you have a continuity of contact and you're

27:03.800 --> 27:08.440
loving them, and they're opening up to you, and you're opening up to them with supercal opening,

27:09.320 --> 27:14.920
there's always that which exceeds. It's funny, you can meet people

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
been together for a very long time, and this has probably happened to you.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.600
Our friends come up to you and say, you know, I've been with her for like 10 years. And then,

27:24.600 --> 27:29.720
wow, I just like, she did that. And wow, totally caught me by surprise. I just, poof.

27:30.680 --> 27:40.440
Because you have to remember learned ignorance. How much you really don't know,

27:42.120 --> 27:46.280
because of how really dynamically complex another person is.

27:48.520 --> 27:56.040
And wisdom and virtue are excellences of persons. And you can never fully know a person. How could

27:56.040 --> 28:03.800
you possibly fully know the excellence of personhood? But you can love it the way you love

28:04.360 --> 28:05.560
a particular person.

28:13.800 --> 28:22.040
Think of the connection between able to really wonder, not in the sense we sometimes overlap

28:22.040 --> 28:31.000
with anxiety, but wonder about your friend or your partner to be amazed by them.

28:33.720 --> 28:43.640
I'm very fortunate to have a romantic partner that she's one of the best people I've met in my life.

28:44.600 --> 28:50.920
And she constantly exceeds. And this is something I have to keep remembering,

28:50.920 --> 28:58.280
relearning. Sati, mindfulness means to remember, not in the sense of just recalling, but reminding

28:58.280 --> 29:03.960
yourself, bringing that memory into action. Mindfulness, I have to constantly remember,

29:03.960 --> 29:12.280
remind myself that she exceeds all of my personal experience, all of my professional expertise.

29:13.640 --> 29:20.840
And she does this so regularly. And yes, so beautifully. I have profound friends. You're

29:20.840 --> 29:25.240
going to meet one of them, Christopher Master Pietro. Same thing within friendship.

29:25.880 --> 29:46.200
Wonder. Love. The cultivation of wisdom. Deep continuity of growing contact.

29:48.120 --> 29:52.520
They're all bound together and learned ignorance.

29:55.640 --> 30:02.440
Socrates also claims to know two really deep and fundamental things.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.000
He famously, in his defense at his trial,

30:10.840 --> 30:15.160
knows that the unexamined life is not worth living.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.400
He knows this with such confidence that he is willing to die for it.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.440
No propositional argument could convince you of that.

30:26.360 --> 30:32.120
But somebody with such powerful presence as Socrates was willing to die for it.

30:33.480 --> 30:40.200
That's at least challenging. He claims a life without dialectic into deologos.

30:42.120 --> 30:47.240
Affording learned ignorance is not worth living.

30:47.560 --> 30:55.800
Socrates is as ignorant as we thought when we just thought, oh, he just doesn't know that he

30:55.800 --> 31:02.120
knows. He says, I know that I don't know. I'm skeptical of a lot of things. I'm cynical. I live

31:02.120 --> 31:09.880
in modernity, postmodernity. No, no, no. This is not knowing that at the same time

31:09.880 --> 31:16.280
gives him the confidence to die as he's telling you and I, because I'm feeling it too.

31:17.480 --> 31:24.360
The unexamined life is not worth living. And what do you do with that? Think about it.

31:27.400 --> 31:32.040
Because I'm sure my life is pretty unexamined. I don't have that self-knowledge.

31:33.960 --> 31:41.800
My life's not worth living. Sometimes I wake up at 3 a.m. and he's sort of right.

31:41.800 --> 31:49.000
I don't want to think about that. He's saying that. And then relatedly, he's saying

31:49.960 --> 31:58.360
that doing this dialectic into deologos and cultivating this learned ignorance, this wonderful,

31:58.920 --> 32:10.440
wonder-filled, learned ignorance is the best activity that human beings can engage in.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.120
It's the best kind of life.

32:17.720 --> 32:25.080
But how? How could a practice that is so frequently frustrating

32:26.040 --> 32:33.240
it does not produce conclusions? It does not produce clear answers? It does not give us

32:33.800 --> 32:37.320
resolution in the sense of completion and finality?

32:40.120 --> 32:45.560
How could that be worth dying for? That sounds like an utter waste of time at best

32:45.560 --> 32:51.800
and endlessly annoying and frustrating and undermining of all of our projects.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.680
How could that be? How could that be?

32:58.600 --> 33:03.080
Savor that question because I've actually returned to the question you asked a few

33:03.080 --> 33:09.400
minutes ago and I've made it deeper on your behalf. By the way, that's me exemplifying Socrates,

33:10.360 --> 33:13.400
taking your question and making it deeper on your behalf.

33:14.040 --> 33:21.400
Take that question in. Savor it. Let it roll around in your mind.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.600
Try to feel into its monstrous challenge.

33:36.280 --> 33:40.120
Think about how it challenges all of our assumptions,

33:40.920 --> 33:47.960
how it crashes into so many of our presuppositions about success and purpose

33:48.520 --> 33:56.440
and achieving your goals and completion, consummation, conclusion, and how all of these

33:56.440 --> 34:05.000
are so central to a good life. That question about Socrates just smashes into all of that

34:05.960 --> 34:06.840
monstrously.

34:10.600 --> 34:20.200
How could this Socratic proposal possibly be true in any way? In fact, in any way that we could

34:20.200 --> 34:23.240
actually realize in regular practice.

34:31.000 --> 34:39.880
But the problematic around Socrates, the way he's liminal, atypous, monstrous is even deeper.

34:42.360 --> 34:48.920
Socrates clearly and repeatedly argues for three things. Number one,

34:50.600 --> 34:57.800
the best life is the life of virtue. First of all, really how? It's a provocative statement

34:57.800 --> 35:05.000
and therefore claiming to know this is again really important. Socrates claims to know that

35:05.640 --> 35:13.160
the life of virtue is the best kind of life. He claims to know that virtue depends on knowledge.

35:14.200 --> 35:17.560
Sometimes some people have rendered that as an identity claim. I won't do that because that's

35:17.560 --> 35:22.840
controversial. But at least virtue depends on knowledge. But what kind of knowledge does virtue

35:22.840 --> 35:28.520
depend on? Okay, good question. We'll come back to it. But first of all, life of virtue is the best

35:28.520 --> 35:36.920
life. Virtue depends on knowledge, at least a particular kind of knowledge. And then Socrates

35:36.920 --> 35:43.800
repeatedly, and we've already seen it, claims that he does not have the knowledge needed for virtue.

35:44.440 --> 35:49.240
How do those hang together? How can that be the case?

35:51.880 --> 35:56.760
And you can say, well, maybe Socrates, if you put those three together, you can put them together

35:56.760 --> 36:03.720
and say, well, Socrates is just realizing he's just kind of a buffoon. And of course, there were

36:03.720 --> 36:08.440
people that thought that, Aristophanes famously in his play the clouds.

36:13.400 --> 36:19.000
But Socrates claims to know what a good life is such that he is willing to die for it.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.480
How does that fit in with that, right? That doesn't fit in with being a buffoon.

36:24.280 --> 36:40.600
And Plato clearly and repeatedly presents Socrates as the most virtuous person living the most

36:41.880 --> 36:43.880
worthwhile and virtuous life.

36:44.200 --> 36:52.920
At the end of the phato, this is the dialogue in which Socrates actually dies.

36:58.040 --> 37:05.480
After Socrates is dead, these last words are spoken.

37:05.960 --> 37:17.240
Very last words. Super salient. The culmination point of the dialogue. Not really, but yes,

37:17.240 --> 37:23.480
here salient, at the end, we're supposed to reflect upon everything else.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.600
Such was the end,

37:27.720 --> 37:32.920
Echocrates, of our friend. Socrates was just died.

37:34.360 --> 37:41.720
Of our friend whom I may truly, wow, call the wisest

37:43.000 --> 37:49.480
and justice most just and best of all men, best of all men.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.200
Who am I ever known?

37:58.520 --> 38:01.320
How is this the case? How could this be the case?

38:01.480 --> 38:20.280
How could that learned ignorance give Socrates the knowledge of the good life,

38:20.280 --> 38:22.600
the confidence in it, for which he's willing to die?

38:26.040 --> 38:31.080
How could that, that thing that challenges all of our assumptions about the good life,

38:31.480 --> 38:34.920
how could that make him the wisest, the most virtuous,

38:37.080 --> 38:39.720
living the most worthwhile life? How?

38:44.200 --> 38:50.680
How could we possibly realize this, understand it, and such that we could put it into practice?

38:51.640 --> 39:02.280
When you roll this around in your mind, it feels like a profound paradox.

39:05.080 --> 39:12.360
He seems to be not knowing, and yet he seems to have all of the results

39:12.360 --> 39:15.240
of the knowing that he says he does not have and does not know.

39:21.400 --> 39:28.680
This feels monstrous, doesn't fit in any of our categories. He's not a buffoon,

39:28.680 --> 39:32.440
but he's not the typical successful person. He doesn't seem to have knowledge,

39:32.440 --> 39:35.480
but he seems to be wise, like what's going on?

39:39.480 --> 39:45.000
Now in response to this, and many people have done this, they even do it in the dialogues,

39:45.000 --> 39:50.280
Plato repeatedly shows that, you can just reject Socrates.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.240
You can say, he's just confused, he's just all messed up.

39:55.400 --> 40:01.480
You can just turn away. You can reorient yourself away from the Socratic path.

40:06.440 --> 40:13.000
It's easy to do, but that ease is only superficial, because if you stop and reflect

40:14.280 --> 40:20.520
at a deeper level, it's actually harder to turn away, to disorient yourself from the Socratic way.

40:21.560 --> 40:30.120
When you read these dialogues, and when you start to practice what Socrates does,

40:31.000 --> 40:38.520
you see Socrates disclosing so much self-deceptive, pretense, bullshit,

40:39.160 --> 40:45.960
misframing, failure to appreciate properly, failure to understand appropriately,

40:46.040 --> 40:55.240
failure to love wisely. Socrates is powerful, and you go, I need all of that, and I put it to you.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.680
Is this not needed now, more so than ever?

41:03.480 --> 41:09.800
Yes, it seems to be. Socrates affords transframing.

41:10.280 --> 41:17.000
What do I mean by that? Well, it's a combination of transcendence, transformation, and reframing.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.400
You know when you have an insight, and you realize you've been misframing,

41:25.400 --> 41:34.680
not properly proportioning and directing your attention, I thought she was being aggressive,

41:34.680 --> 41:40.200
afraid. Oh, I've just been mishandling this whole thing. I was mistaken.

41:44.600 --> 41:50.920
It's insight. But you can also get what John Wright following Iris Murdoch, and I talk a lot

41:50.920 --> 41:56.520
about this in Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, called Sensibility to Transcendence. I can get

41:56.520 --> 42:01.960
simultaneously an insight into that person, and a reflective insight into me,

42:02.920 --> 42:07.880
that the way I have habitually been framing or thinking about things or being with people

42:07.880 --> 42:15.240
also needs to be reframed. And I can be reframing that person and reframing my sense of who I am

42:15.240 --> 42:21.480
and how I look at the world. And that means I start to reciprocally open. I start to transcend

42:21.480 --> 42:28.680
myself. I start to afford that person to transcend my conception of them. I start to be transformed.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.880
They start to be transformed in how they are and can be to me.

42:35.240 --> 42:42.680
Transframing. Socrates affords that. And here's the thing. That transframing ability seems to be

42:42.680 --> 42:50.760
central to becoming wiser. It seems central to a lot of spirituality. And if we want wise

42:50.760 --> 42:55.560
spirituality, and don't we, can we afford to turn away from Socrates?

42:59.480 --> 43:09.240
Socrates deeply inspires, affords aspiration of the Platonic tradition, the Stoic tradition,

43:09.240 --> 43:15.160
and the Neoplatonic tradition. And all of these are going through significant revivals right now.

43:15.160 --> 43:21.560
And for good reason, they are needed in our times. And if they are needed, so is Socrates,

43:21.560 --> 43:27.000
because Socrates is at the heart of them. You can't pull apart Plato and Socrates.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.880
Stoicism is the religious philosophy or the philosophical religion, I don't know which,

43:31.880 --> 43:38.040
what to call it, of internalizing Socrates. At least central aspects of everything I've been

43:38.040 --> 43:48.360
talking about. Neoplatonism is, and we'll see this, the profound pathway into the deepest

43:48.360 --> 43:55.000
possible learned ignorance. We can't turn away from Socrates.

43:57.960 --> 44:05.720
Socrates is like all the other sages who are paradoxical, atypos and strange. If we turn

44:05.720 --> 44:10.920
away from Socrates, we turn away from Siddhartha Gautama, we turn away from Jesus of Nazareth,

44:10.920 --> 44:18.120
we turn away from Swangsha, we turn away from Lao Tse, we turn away from etc, etc.

44:18.120 --> 44:22.840
Can you afford to turn away from all those sages? Are you so confident

44:24.200 --> 44:32.600
that you can reorient away from all of them and find the path to wisdom, virtue, meaning in life?

44:33.080 --> 44:43.800
Think about it. Be honest. I propose, and this is an honest proposal, in the sense that this

44:43.800 --> 44:49.960
isn't my life, this is how I try to live. I propose trying to move deeply into this problematic

44:49.960 --> 44:59.240
of Socrates. I want to allow it the real possibility of challenging me, of transforming me,

44:59.240 --> 45:10.040
of calling me into transforming. I want to move through, like the through of my lenses.

45:10.040 --> 45:17.000
I want to move through this Socratic problematic. I aspire to this. I have tried to dedicate my life

45:17.000 --> 45:30.520
to it. To do this deeply, we need to confront further dimensions of this problematic.

45:33.480 --> 45:41.800
Socrates does not have a method. So how do we move forward in a practice? How do we

45:41.800 --> 45:52.120
forward into the problematic? Is Socrates just Plato's mouthpiece? Are the words of Socrates

45:52.120 --> 45:57.480
equivalent to what Plato wants us to get from the dialogue? That's problematic too.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.200
The third wave, people like Gonzales and Hyland,

46:02.920 --> 46:10.680
just several rapes, just so many people, so many of those books.

46:12.760 --> 46:21.000
I'll argue, no. Plato wrote in a dialogue form in which he is only in one, I think in the apology,

46:21.880 --> 46:30.360
in just very minor way, actually present. He's absent. He never puts himself in the dialogue.

46:31.320 --> 46:36.600
And the dialogue is not there as sort of literary ornamentation around Socrates.

46:37.640 --> 46:41.000
In fact, and this will be central to following Socrates,

46:42.920 --> 46:50.280
the collective intelligence and the distributed cognition of all of the characters in the dialogue

46:50.920 --> 47:03.000
is actually central to us following the Socratic path. Socrates is central. He's important in the

47:03.000 --> 47:13.480
dialogue. But he's also in service to the Deologos, the way other people are drawn out, the way other

47:13.560 --> 47:20.760
people represent alternative perspectives, alternative ways of being that Socrates takes into account,

47:22.920 --> 47:26.840
which is one interpretation, one translation of the word logos, by the way,

47:26.840 --> 47:28.840
taking into account, giving an account.

47:29.160 --> 47:38.760
One way in which we can understand this is can we

47:41.480 --> 47:47.640
get into a flow state, logos with the life of its own,

47:49.560 --> 47:54.360
of the collective intelligence of distributed cognition,

47:55.080 --> 48:05.720
that has the capacity to cultivate both individual and collective wisdom. Can we be

48:06.840 --> 48:16.520
Socrates to each other? Because if we need Socrates to do this, and all of the traditions say,

48:16.520 --> 48:20.200
in one sense we do, but in another sense we don't, then of course we couldn't do it.

48:21.160 --> 48:29.720
We need to know how to internalize Socrates, both within us individually and between us collectively.

48:37.240 --> 48:45.000
One function of the dialogues, I think, and how they're not replaceable by just capturing,

48:45.640 --> 48:49.240
this is an argument made by Socrates, and this represents Plato's theory.

48:52.120 --> 48:59.480
One function of the dialog format is it affords internalization. What's internalization?

48:59.480 --> 49:11.240
This is a notion drawn from Bogotsky. This is the notion that, let's say a child is learning,

49:12.200 --> 49:15.400
and for some of you you've heard this before, but for some of you maybe not.

49:15.400 --> 49:18.680
How does learning? They're taking a particular perspective on a problem.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.280
The adult comes in to try and teach them. I've raised children.

49:26.680 --> 49:30.200
The adult has a more encompassing and penetrating perspective

49:31.560 --> 49:38.120
that includes but transcends. Hear that, it includes but transcends the child's perspective.

49:41.800 --> 49:53.720
But the child does imitate the adult. And as they imitate the adult, they start to

49:55.560 --> 50:01.480
enact the perspective that the adult has. As they presence the adult in imitation,

50:01.480 --> 50:07.000
they start to fill in the perspective that the adult had on their perspective.

50:07.560 --> 50:13.160
And eventually they do this to such a degree that they do not need the adult present. They

50:13.160 --> 50:17.720
can do it for themselves, and then they get metacognition. They can step back and reflect

50:17.720 --> 50:22.120
on their own cognition. They could perhaps come to know that they do not know.

50:26.920 --> 50:32.920
You see that? See, when you're in a perspective, remember when we compared the first person

50:33.880 --> 50:38.920
perspective, there's a third person perspective, when you're asking your friend about the problem

50:38.920 --> 50:45.880
that they're having. When you're in a perspective, that framing, it blinds you to what's outside

50:45.880 --> 50:50.120
the perspective. You can't see the biases of your perspective, and you can't take on new

50:50.120 --> 50:57.800
interest beyond your perspective. But when you internalize other people, you transcend,

50:58.760 --> 51:01.080
and you get the capacity to itself transcend,

51:04.360 --> 51:10.920
you get the capacity to self-correct, to overcome bias, and to orient more properly

51:10.920 --> 51:17.560
and appropriately towards reality. But as the child is to the adult,

51:19.160 --> 51:25.320
the adult is to the sage, just as a child you needed to internalize adults.

51:25.320 --> 51:35.720
As an adult, you need to internalize a sage. Why could you possibly think you're done?

51:35.800 --> 51:58.920
Okay, but Socrates problematizes this. What? How? Well, he often speaks and presents himself ironically.

51:59.240 --> 52:07.080
In fact, this is one of the most famous aspects of Socrates. He's ironic. Now, he's not ironic in

52:07.080 --> 52:15.720
sort of our modern cynical sense of irony, but he's often saying something that's opposite

52:16.600 --> 52:21.720
to what he actually holds to be the case, even though he asks people to always state honestly

52:21.720 --> 52:27.240
what they believe. So Socrates is often speaking and presenting himself ironically.

52:28.200 --> 52:32.760
Imagine if the parent was constantly being ironic with the small child.

52:33.880 --> 52:36.600
That's going to destroy the internalization.

52:40.600 --> 52:50.040
Socrates' irony seems to thwart the function of the dialogues, which is to help us deeply

52:50.040 --> 52:55.880
internalize Socrates, have his perspectival knowing, see the way he sees, realize the way he

52:55.880 --> 53:02.120
realizes, have his participatory knowing, transform our character, our identity, the way he does,

53:02.120 --> 53:09.400
transform our self-knowledge. But the irony seems to be undermining all of that.

53:12.920 --> 53:19.080
Is the irony just so that Socrates or Plato can avoid political censure?

53:19.240 --> 53:25.480
People have argued that, but most people, most of the people I've been reading,

53:25.480 --> 53:33.400
the scholars I've been reading, saying no. Is it because Socrates can't sort of directly

53:33.400 --> 53:39.160
challenge people? There's truth to that, but many of the people that he's talking with know he's

53:39.160 --> 53:44.760
being ironic. And he does seem to really challenge them at times.

53:50.200 --> 53:58.520
Yet maybe, in a deeper way, irony is actually connected to learned ignorance.

54:02.600 --> 54:06.280
And in that sense, it affords the right kind of internalization.

54:06.920 --> 54:11.720
I'm going to throw that out, tantalizing, and we're going to give a special place to that.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.560
When Chris and I enter into

54:18.440 --> 54:23.320
dialogue and hopefully deal logos about Socrates and Kierkegaard,

54:24.600 --> 54:33.320
because Kierkegaard reflects deeply on Socratic irony. And other people, especially people like

54:33.320 --> 54:41.240
Drew Highland, Kirkland, and his work on the ontology of Socratic questioning, they all do great

54:41.240 --> 54:53.720
work around this. So what are some points to ponder, points that we want to reflect upon so that we

54:53.720 --> 55:01.000
can realize them in practice? We want to realize on one hand, the dialectic and to deal logos and

55:01.000 --> 55:07.720
how it's in this reciprocal relationship with learned ignorance on the horizon of wonder.

55:11.000 --> 55:18.280
We want to really let it roll around in our mind, banging and crashing like a loose cannon

55:19.080 --> 55:20.440
on a ship at sea.

55:20.760 --> 55:31.560
This problematic around Socrates, only by passing through this problematic,

55:31.560 --> 55:40.760
this paradoxical problematic, will we have any chance of genuinely following Socrates.

55:40.920 --> 55:51.800
And for those of you who follow other sages, Siddhartha, Jesus, Maimonides,

55:55.960 --> 56:03.240
I put it to you that following the way of this sage has the real potential

56:03.800 --> 56:08.760
to deepen your ability to be a disciple of the sage that you are most trying to internalize.

56:11.720 --> 56:19.240
Perhaps even it would be best if you had an inner symphony of sages.

56:19.240 --> 56:25.080
One of them can be preeminent. I do not want to call anybody away from a living allegiance

56:25.080 --> 56:29.960
that is breathing into them wisdom and orientation towards reality,

56:30.920 --> 56:33.320
that's maturing them in virtue.

56:37.480 --> 56:47.080
But perhaps a symphony of sages not only will help disclose what any particular sage is,

56:48.680 --> 56:57.880
but also allow you to participate in a way of wisdom that allows you to understand

56:58.840 --> 57:07.160
not superficial, polite, liberal tolerance or ideological yelling at and not really quite

57:07.160 --> 57:14.200
sure you know what it means, diversity or whatever word you're using. These can be good,

57:14.760 --> 57:17.880
they can be bad, but I'm trying to point to something more profound.

57:21.240 --> 57:27.320
Could you understand other people's sages such that you could enter into deal logos with them?

57:27.880 --> 57:30.600
You don't have to agree with them, they don't have to agree with you.

57:31.880 --> 57:35.400
You don't have to come to a conclusion if Socrates is right,

57:37.000 --> 57:43.000
but if Socrates is right that would still be part of the best, maybe the best kind of life

57:43.000 --> 57:45.160
we could live with each other.

57:45.880 --> 57:58.520
It is superficially easy to turn away from Socrates and not orient ourselves socratically,

58:02.120 --> 58:07.880
but it's actually in reality hard to turn away.

58:08.120 --> 58:18.440
Before we move into learning our new practices, rooting and humble wonder,

58:19.640 --> 58:25.560
I remind you to continue always doing your dialogical reflection,

58:27.000 --> 58:32.120
your imaginal engagement and enactment and your study.

58:33.080 --> 58:37.560
So we're going to do two practices. The first one is going to help us build on

58:39.080 --> 58:46.280
the mindfulness practice of centering. This first practice is called finding your root.

58:47.800 --> 58:51.240
It has to do with developing the right kind of relaxation

58:51.960 --> 58:56.360
in your meditative practice. Many people come to meditation because they want to learn

58:56.440 --> 59:06.680
how to relax. The problem is our normal way of relaxing is opposite to what we want to be doing.

59:06.680 --> 59:14.600
We are making our body more insensate. We're letting our mind slowly shrink and become clouded,

59:16.040 --> 59:22.680
somewhat confused, sort of warm and fuzzy until we lose consciousness because the point of that

59:22.680 --> 59:28.760
relaxation is to move us towards sleep. We may not go all the way, but that is its function and

59:28.760 --> 59:38.360
it often ends in us falling asleep. That's not what we want to be doing in a meditative practice

59:38.360 --> 59:47.880
in which we are trying to learn and we're trying to become more aware of the forms, the formations,

59:47.880 --> 59:56.520
the functions and the processes within our mind and body. I think of the kind of relaxation

59:58.280 --> 01:00:06.920
that a martial artist engages in. So very often you'll see martial arts. I teach Tai Chi Chuan

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:14.680
and you'll see them take a particular stance. They'll bend their legs, they'll sink,

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.720
they'll sink their arms into a position, they might close their fists, they might have open hands,

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.800
but they do this thing. It's called rooting. Why are they doing that?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:33.000
Well, they're trying to do two things. They're trying to stabilize

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.120
their arms, their legs, their body. They're trying to stabilize,

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:46.280
but they're also relaxing. So if you tense your arm like this and you touch, you'll feel there's not

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:52.040
very much sensation, but when you relax and you find that sort of stable point and you can relax

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.760
into it, you'll realize, oh wait, this is a lot. I've really increased my sensitivity. So you see

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:05.080
what's happening here? The rooting is a kind of relaxation that simultaneously sensitizes the mind,

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:12.840
makes it more alert, more acute, but also stabilizes it so it doesn't start running off

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:18.440
and getting scattered. So you're trying to get this sensitization and stabilization that are

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:25.640
interpenetrating to each other. Now think about how much that would matter in a martial art situation.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.760
You're coming into a situation, there's going to be all this unexpectedness.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.880
If you start flailing around because of the unexpectedness, you're easily uprooted.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:43.400
If you just sort of lock in, your ability to sense what's going on and respond is lost.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:49.640
You want to find this optimal relationship between sensitivity and stability.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.360
Now you may be saying, well, I'm not going to get into any fights.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.680
I hope that's right, by the way, because when if you're fighting, even if you win,

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:05.640
you lose. You lose a little piece of your soul. So what's the point of, well, the point is transfer.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:12.200
Think about entering into a situation in which you want to enter into a deep dialogue

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:18.760
with another human being the way Socrates does. And Socrates is all just sort of scattered.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:29.320
Then his capacity for entering into the deep conversation is lost.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:36.680
But if he's just rigid and closed in upon himself and holding on to his position no matter what,

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.600
you can't move me, I am so stable. It's true, I can't. But then what's the point of the conversation?

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.320
How will the dialogue take? How will it lead both people?

01:02:49.000 --> 01:03:00.600
So you want to be sensitive yet stable, stable yet sensitive, so that you can optimally flow

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:10.040
within any situation, especially situations of dialogical encounter. Being able to root,

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:21.800
really important. So often when I'm doing these discussions that I have with people and engaging

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:29.800
in these Socratic practices in a way that they might not know, I'm doing Tai Chi Chuan. They

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:35.080
don't know it. Sometimes they do. I've had people look at one of my videos, especially when the

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.680
other person was sort of very interruptive or hyperactive, and they'll say, you were like doing

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:48.920
really good Tai Chi there. Yes, exactly. I take that as a very encouraging compliment for which

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:56.200
I'm grateful because I aspire to that. I aspire to be able to have that rootedness so that I'm not

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:03.320
easily overwhelmed, but I can also flow into the situation. I'm aware of what's going on.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:11.560
In the meditative tradition, this is called sitting as still as a mountain, but as alert as a warrior.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.840
This is a phrase used, by the way, within Buddhist traditions that are often committed to non-violence.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:28.200
So how do we do it? How do we do it? How do we get that? And how do we learn it in a way that can

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.320
transfer to most of our life? Well, if you think about Taoism, you can think about

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:41.560
that the very famous Yang Yin symbol with the black and the white and the black dot and the

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:48.120
white dot and the white dot in the black area, showing that they're flowing. They have this

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.600
flowing balance and they interpenetrate each other.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:05:01.480
We're trying to get a mind that is open, yet centered and stabilized.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.880
It can flow out into Yang, but it can also return to Yin,

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.360
and it has these so that they interpenetrate each other.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:19.960
Now, how would you do this practice? Well, first of all,

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.440
you go through your centering practice. You do all three centers. I won't repeat that now,

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:33.960
but you make sure you center mind and body. You center your attention. You center your attitude.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:40.760
Get centered. Now, I'm going to describe the practice to you and what it looks like,

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.240
what it feels like. Let's say you're centered. Your eyes are closed.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.640
I want you to imagine a space just slightly above your head,

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:56.200
and then as you inhale, you're expanding in all directions, almost like you were inflating a balloon,

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.680
a perfectly spherical balloon in all directions. You inhale. This is you opening up. This is you

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:09.640
expanding your awareness, expanding your connection to the world. Right? As you inhale,

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.400
don't hyperventilate, but you inhale and you expand.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.880
And then as you exhale, you let everything gather back together.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:29.800
This is the end. You come in. You come in. So inhale, exhale, and then you find that spot.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.480
Oh, right there. That's about right. Where it is for you is where it is for you.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:41.720
Don't imitate what I'm doing. Imitate the way I'm doing something.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:50.760
Inhale, exhale. And the last little bit of the exhale and that little space in between the breaths,

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:57.240
it's like I'm opening and melting and draining, and I'm coming to what's called the third eye

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:06.760
traditionally. And from there, but even from the center of my head on that axis, I inhale out,

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:21.640
I exhale in, opening, melting, draining to the throat. Inhale, remember all directions, 360.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.160
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.200
opening, melting, draining to the heart.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.520
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.120
opening and melting and draining to the solar plexus.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:55.320
Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering and falling back towards the center.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:03.000
Yang into Yin, Yin into Yang. Do you see? Opening, melting, draining to this area called the Dantian.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.400
This is eventually where you want your breathing to be when you're meditating.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:13.720
Don't force it there. Let it naturally fall there over time. But here you center around there.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.280
The tradition says one finger below your navel, three fingers in.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.960
I don't know if that's precise, but something like that. Inhale, exhale.

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:36.040
And then opening and melting, draining to where that center axis is touching what you're sitting on.

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:42.040
Feel that point. Everything is drained there like a pool of liquid.

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:51.080
And now you let it sink into the earth. Imagination for the sake of enhancing perception.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:57.800
You let it sink like the root of a tree, rooting. It's sinking into the earth, connecting you,

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:05.000
stabilizing you downward, but also nourishing you, energizing you, sensitizing you upward

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:11.640
so that you're then sitting as still as a mountain.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:20.760
But as alert, as a warrior. So you center, find your three centers.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.880
Go through that rooting practice. You may want to replay that sequence.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.360
So I can talk you through it while you're doing it.

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:39.080
Once you feel that sweet spot, that optimal grip between Yin and Yang,

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:47.000
you feel rooted into the earth, then begin your meditation, following your breath,

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:54.280
labeling your distractions, befriending yourself. That is the rooting practice.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:02.760
The other practice is specifically oriented towards

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.360
the learned ignorance that we've been talking about in this episode.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:17.720
This is a practice that I call the humble wonder practice. Humility and wonder were both

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:28.280
central and integral to the Socratic practices, especially the practice of learned ignorance.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:39.160
How does this practice work? I recommend first centering and rooting and doing two or three

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:48.200
minutes of basic meditation. Then bring your awareness to your heart area. You can put your

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.960
hands on your heart. I won't put them right there because I don't want to screw up my mic.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:11:00.600
Then I say as mindfully, and you've been cultivating mindfulness now, I say as mindfully as I can.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.440
There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.680
There is so much you do not know about your mind, your psyche, your body,

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.920
the amount of information available to you is combinatorial explosive.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:26.920
But instead of keeping it as a safe, propositional thing you store over here, you're realizing it.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:34.680
There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:41.720
If you want to add all the facts about myself, feel fine. Feel free to do so.

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:49.640
Next, there is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:55.320
faith. Faith, what do you mean by faith, John? I don't mean your cosmic destiny or something

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:02.280
written down. I mean faith in the sense that it's in the word fatal. You're born at a particular

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:07.960
time in a particular place. You're exposed to particular people, to particular events,

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.440
none of which you have control over, and they deeply shape you. If you do not acknowledge

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:21.080
your faith in that sense, your inherent finitude, then your capacity for really

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.480
realizing your self-knowledge is truncated in hamstrung.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:34.840
There is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the faith.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.480
Next, and they're all Fs to help you remember.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:49.720
There is so much I refuse to see about myself because of all of my foolishness.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:13:00.040
All the processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially and sometimes

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:12.760
pervasively beset by self-deception. How often? Be honest. Really honest, please. How often do

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:20.280
you really, not in thought or in belief, but actually in perspective and in how you participate

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.720
in your identity, how often do you actually challenge your egocentrism and the way it might be

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:34.440
bias in you? Igor Grossman found, he asked people to describe a really hard problem they're

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.880
involved in. They inevitably describe it from the first person perspective without thinking,

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.800
automatic framing. And then if you say to them, and think about Socrates here, questioning people,

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.800
if you say to them, well, can you re-describe that problem from a third person perspective,

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:58.200
how your friend might see it and describe it? And will people do this? They inevitably have

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.920
an insight. They realize, oh, I didn't see this. I didn't realize that. You know that what I'm saying

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:13.080
is true. Think about how wise you are about other people's problems. Don't you realize it, Jim?

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.920
You're doing that same self-destructive pattern in your romantic life. I can see it so clearly,

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:25.800
and Jim is like, I don't really see it. And you think, ha, ha, ha, but then the roles are reversed

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.720
and Jim is saying to you, hey, you're doing that thing you do with relationship to your career.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:35.880
You're doing it again. Don't you see? And you go, I don't really see it. You know that.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:44.520
Part of what we're going to learn in these Socratic practices is how to be Socrates

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.400
for yourself. And that's inexorably bound up with how can we be Socrates to each other?

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:59.080
Okay, so back first. Let's repeat. Let's review. There's so much I do not know about myself because

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:08.520
of all of the facts. Realize it. Don't just state it. Live it. There's so much I shall never know

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:15.160
about myself because of all of the fate. Realize it. Become into deep awareness. Make it real.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.720
There's so much I refuse to see because of all of my foolishness.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:36.360
Realize it. And then there is so much I'm unable to see about myself because of all of my faults.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.360
And you're probably saying, oh, this is a real downer. Stick with it. Stay with me.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.080
It doesn't end that way.

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.280
Then you can turn your hands outward like this.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:03.000
We go through the same procedure. There is so much I don't know about the world because of all of the facts.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:10.920
There is so much I shall never know about the world because of all of the fate.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.440
There is so much I refuse to see about the world because of all of my foolishness.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.720
There is so much I am unable to see about the world because of all of my faults.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:36.840
Then relax your hands back down to your meditation. And here's now where it flips.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:43.960
You did the humility. And if it was just humility, it could be humiliating,

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:53.320
but it's not just the humility. Now as I inhale, both inwardly and outwardly,

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.720
I experience wonder, not curiosity, where I'm trying to find missing information.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.400
And we'll talk more about this, but wonder, where I'm able to call the world and myself

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:13.960
into question, but in a way that is positive, that is enriching, that is growing me.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:22.280
As I inhale, I wonder into the center of my mind outward to the circumference of the world,

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:32.200
inhaling, wondering, and then exhaling, receiving, receiving, being open to receiving from the world

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.360
and receiving from the depths of my psyche, the depths of the world and the depths of the psyche,

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:44.200
receiving, inhaling, wonder, wondering inward, wondering outward.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:54.440
Exhale, receiving, receiving from the depths of the psyche, receiving from the depths of the world.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:10.120
Do that practice with the breath at least four times. You may want to do it longer

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:17.320
and get the sense of the wonder and the receptivity actually interpenetrating,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:25.880
mutually affording and enriching each other, so that you have wonder filled receptivity,

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:32.520
wonderful, wonderful receptivity. You have a profound humility,

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:43.000
but a transcendent wonder. That is the humble wonder of practice.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:52.200
I recommend still doing your basic meditation practice, centering and rooting,

01:18:54.040 --> 01:19:01.640
and then do this practice, both sides of it. The humility practice and the wonder side

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.320
and that usually only takes about five to ten minutes. You can shave a little bit off

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:12.440
the meditation if you really want to limit yourself to staying under 25 minutes in total,

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:19.640
but try it. See if it goes the full length and it doesn't bother you if it takes maybe 25 minutes.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.840
And you may be saying, John, you're going to add all these practices and I'm not going to have time

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:33.560
for them. I bet you do. Take out your phone. How much screen time have you put in today?

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:41.960
How much did it actually make you wiser? How much did it actually make you more virtuous,

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.520
connect you to yourself, to other people, to the world? How much?

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:55.880
I bet a significant portion of it, maybe even most of it, was wasted time.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:07.560
How about fasting a little bit from your phone so that you can feed more from the fount of wisdom?

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.360
As always, thank you very much for your time and attention.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:23.160
What is dialectic into the logos and how does one practice it?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:31.720
The related question is, what is this logos that I've sort of been only referring to intuitively

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:38.040
that's so central to the logos? We're going to start with the first question

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:44.200
and as we answer it, it will give us what we need to answer the second question. So what is,

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:50.200
what is dialectic into the logos? Everything is coming down to this.
