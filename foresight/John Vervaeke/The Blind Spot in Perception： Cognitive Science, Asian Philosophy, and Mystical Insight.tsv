0	4320	Welcome, everyone. I've been really looking forward to this particular voices with Reveke.
5200	9760	You're no doubt looking at somebody who you've heard, many of you have heard me mention multiple
9760	18560	times. Cytus' work and his influence are repeatedly a huge impact on me and somebody I've gotten to
18560	23680	know on a somewhat more personal level. We were colleagues. I taught his son at one point,
24320	32000	well, multiple points, I think. He's just a fantastic and, I think, important thinker in
32000	37360	the field of cognitive science. I think he's probably one of the most premier, if not the
37360	45360	premier person, representing what's called for ecogsci. That, I think, is very pertinent
46160	53600	to questions that we're wrestling with around the nature of meaning, etc. I'm going to just
53600	59520	turn things over to my friend Evan Thompson and ask him to give us a little bit more of the
59520	64000	background that he thinks might be relevant. Then we'll move to the issue at hand.
64560	72400	Yeah. I am first and foremost a philosopher. That's my academic training. I work in the
72400	77920	areas of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, both theoretical cognitive science and collaborating
77920	84160	with experimental scientists. I also have a strong interest in Asian philosophy. My undergraduate
84160	90000	training was in Asian studies, Chinese language and history. I got drawn into philosophy really
90000	94800	through studying Chinese philosophy. I went the reverse path from the path that sometimes
95600	104240	people take from east to west in my case academically. I have a continuing interest in
104320	108480	the conversation between Asian philosophical traditions and Western philosophy.
108480	112960	I also have a strong interest in phenomenology, the tradition coming from Edmund Husserl.
113680	117680	That plays a strong role. The phenomenological tradition plays a strong role in the most recent
117680	125280	book, The Blind Spot. Which is what we're going to turn to. Evan just referred to it. This is it.
126640	130480	I want to strongly recommend this book, especially for people who are interested in
130480	136320	the meaning crisis. It is the central topic of this book. It is called The Crisis in Meaning,
136320	142480	the Meaning Crisis, The Blind Spot. The Blind Spot is a particular account and explanation of
143360	150320	the meaning crisis. This book is written with Adam Frank, Marcello Glycer, or Gleaser, is it
150320	157440	Glycer? Glycer, Marcello Glycer, yeah. And Evan Thompson is the third author. When I got this
157440	163280	book, I opened it and I was like, whoa, things that are near and dear to my heart and to my work
163280	170000	and my besetting obsessions, the meaning crisis was there. And then there's this notion of the
170000	174560	blind spot, which we'll unpack in a minute. And I turned to chapter nine on cognition as I often do
174560	181280	in any book, because that's my shtick. And the blind spot in cognition was explicitly named as
181280	186320	relevance realization, something else near and dear to my heart. And so as soon as I saw that,
186320	191280	I hadn't read any more of the book, I just read about 10 pages here and looked at the chapter
191280	196000	and I went, oh, wow. And I showed my partner the book and I was like so excited about it. So I
196000	200000	reached out to Evan right away and I said, you got to come on, we got to talk about this. Your
200000	207280	work and my work really talk to each other really deeply at this point. The book, just some basic
207280	214320	things, the book is wonderful. I'm talking now sort of rhetorically, it's clearly written,
214320	218720	it's accessible. I wouldn't say it's like a beach read, like you're just going to sit there and
218720	223440	write. You have to put thought into it. It demands, it provokes and demands reflection
223440	231120	and consideration. But it is also not pitched to the academic hoi paloi or anything like that.
231120	238560	It is really written as I think it should be given the topic to a general educated audience
238560	243680	of people who are concerned with the meaning crisis and how we get here and what it is and
243680	247200	what is this meaning we're talking about and how can we ameliorate it. So first of all,
248000	254560	book is really wonderfully written, very clear. Now the thing I want to ask you very quickly
254560	261040	about and unpack this a little bit before we get into the meat of it, this book has a very
261040	265360	single voice to it. Sometimes you know when you're reading books by multiple authors, you hear this,
265360	272080	you get the sense of a carcophony and it's, you know, and you use we throughout and everything,
272080	279600	you're reminding the reader constantly as you should. But the voice has, I find the clear
279600	284640	integrated voice, like how did that come about and how did you make that happen?
285360	291120	Well, I'm glad that it reads that way. Obviously that was, you know, that was a challenge in
291120	300240	writing a book with three authors. And I would say that the responsibility for really doing the
301040	306160	overall smoothing as we called it and kind of unifying of tone and narrative that that was
306160	312560	really part of my role as the writer. Each chapter was written in a first draft initially
312560	318560	by one of the three of us. So Adam Frank, you know, took the lead on the Quantum Mechanics chapter,
318560	323360	Marcelo Gleister took the lead on the Cosmology chapter, I took the lead on, you know, the
323360	330400	Cognition Consciousness and the Introduction chapters. But then we each, you know, wrote over
330400	336320	each other's drafts. And then when we felt that we all were sort of on the same page with regard
336320	342640	to what we were saying, then it was really my job to smooth it out and just give it a unified voice
342640	350320	and tone. Which I'm happy to hear you say you think it works because, you know, when you're
350320	358800	doing something like that, you don't want to remove the particular, you know, the special
358800	362480	things that each author has in the way they articulate something, the way they write something,
362480	366960	you don't want to just remove that and flatten things. But on the other hand, you can't have really
368720	375120	very different styles in the same chapter, let alone the same book. So that definitely took
375120	380000	some work. But I enjoyed that work actually, I found it very satisfying and it enabled me to
380160	385840	really deeply think through each chapter with materials that, you know, I'm not an expert on,
385840	391840	you know, quantum mechanics, cosmology, the physics of time. I mean, these are not my areas
391840	395680	of expertise. I have an interest in them from a philosophy of science angle, but that's not,
395680	399600	you know, to be a scientist in those areas. So I learned a lot from doing that.
400400	405120	Well, that's interesting. And I won't open this up as rabbit hole, although maybe we'll return
405120	410160	to it. I mean, I've been doing a lot of work right now on dialogical reason as opposed to
410160	416240	monological reason and a lot of the emerging evidence about how it has a lot of capacities
416240	421520	to overcome bias and to be more clear and complex at the same time that you get with
421520	429600	monological. So I welcome that, the fact that this was sort of dialogically produced.
430560	434800	So in order to flesh that out a little bit more, can you tell me a little bit more about Adam and
434800	442960	Marcello? Yeah, so Adam Frank is an astronomer and astrophysicist at the University of Rochester.
444480	449920	He works on a number of different things in science and he's written a number of more general
449920	458240	audience books. Marcelo Gleiser is a theoretical physicist and he's also, you know, done a number
458240	464000	of different things in the scientific domains as well as having written a number of popular books.
464720	470320	So the way that we wound up writing this book is that Marcello
472000	478880	directed for I think about five or six years at Dartmouth College where he's based an institute
478880	485840	for cross disciplinary engagement, ICE. And he invited, you know, fellows each year to come and
485840	489680	be there for a couple of weeks and give some talks and just interact with the community there.
490240	498000	And he invited Adam and me, I think it would have been 2016 or 2017, I don't remember,
498000	506880	so we were both there together. And we just started talking and at one point in our conversations
506880	512320	about, you know, science and experience, this term, the blind spot sort of popped into our
512320	519840	conversation and then we just kept sort of working on it, the three of us, and eventually
519840	524000	it became clear that, you know, we had something that we wanted to write. So it really came out
524000	529840	of conversations, our collaboration as a result of Marcello's having this kind of special
529840	533440	intellectual setting where he was inviting scientists and philosophers and historians and
534160	542960	religious teachers, spiritual teachers as well, also to the center. And so their background is
542960	547840	really coming out of physics and history of science and then the conversation between us
547840	555680	was what launched the book. That's excellent. So there's a good representation both from the
555760	564000	history and the philosophy of science going into this book. So I want you to unpack the
564000	568400	core argument. No, and people do this to me all the time. Can you summarize Awakening Tim from
568400	580320	the meeting crisis? Right. Yeah. So we'll give you time and space, but when you do that, though,
580320	586640	can you talk a little bit about how at least these figures show up in the introduction? They
586640	593920	show up sort of throughout, but you know, Nishita and Whitehead and then Cartwright,
594880	600160	three philosophers at least, that's maybe the best category they all belong to,
600160	605360	are playing a pivotal role. Cartwright I'm unfamiliar with. I've just purchased a couple
605440	610720	of her books because of the blind spot, so thank you for that. Now, Whitehead and Nishita,
610720	616080	I'm doing a lot of work on and I've been doing this on and off for several years, but
617760	628240	I mean, they have a notion about this idea that in some way, I'll use Whitehead's idea here.
629280	632640	We've gotten into kind of a performative contradictions where we're making statements
632640	640240	about reality, and then I'll use Nishita from a standpoint that isn't consistent with those
640240	647840	statements. So, and many people on watching my channel, I've made this argument about scientists
648800	653280	making pronouncements about everything above the level of the quantum being an illusion,
653280	658560	and then it's like, but then you're basing those statements on all these illusory machines and
658560	664720	gauges and illusory conferences and like, what? How are you drawing deep conclusions about the
664720	669840	ultimate nature of reality from all this illusory material and that there's a performative contradiction?
673760	677600	I don't know if this is the actual source, but I credit Whitehead was sort of the first person
677600	682240	to really put his finger on that performative contradiction, although I've seen Nishita doing
682240	688640	something very similar, especially when he gets to Basho, when he's talking about Basho. So,
690480	697200	what is the argument and why the term the blind spot, which I found really helpful
698080	708240	as an enacted metaphor for this? Right. So, maybe we'll start with the metaphor of the blind spot.
708240	715040	So, the blind spot in the way that we're using the term is a metaphor from the blind spot in
715040	726160	the individual field that we have that all mammals have, actually. And it's the area of the retina
726160	736640	where the optic nerve leaves and projects inward into the brain. And because there are no
737280	741840	light sensitive receptor cells, where that bundle of nerve fibers enters into the brain,
741840	747760	we don't see anything in the blind spot. There's no possibility of visual sensitivity
747760	752240	to what's in the blind spot. But we also don't see that we have a blind spot because
755120	758960	the situation is the eyes are constantly darting about and the blind spots of the two eyes are
758960	764000	different. And so, as it is said, we sort of fill in across the blind spot. So,
764000	770160	we have a blind spot, an area within the visual field in which we don't see and we don't see
770160	778800	that we don't see. So, this is a metaphor for the idea that in our scientific world view,
779600	787440	there is something that makes science possible, that is the, you could say, the source of science.
788000	793920	But we don't see it and we don't see that we don't see it. And what it is, and now we could
793920	799840	use different words for this. What it is, is lived experience, direct experience, immediate
799840	809120	intuition, pure awareness, these terms that thinkers like William James and Kitara Nishida,
809920	816000	and also figures in literature in the 19th turn of the 20th century are interested in
816000	821680	stream of consciousness. All of these thinkers as modern science is becoming this tremendously
821680	827520	powerful epistemic accomplishment. All of these thinkers are Whitehead, Husserl, the phenomenologists,
827520	834960	they're all grappling with this recognition that there is an experiential source to our knowledge
835600	842960	that we systematically occlude when we think about the nature of that knowledge. And the way that we
842960	849280	do that, it takes different forms, but the way that we do that in how we think about science
849280	858400	is that we step back, we look for invariance across perspectives, we look for things that we can
860080	868160	objectify and quantify across a community of observers, forgetting that those things actually
868160	873360	depend on and arise out of a background of lived experience. And then we objectify them in a way
873360	878160	where we take them to be more fundamental than the experience that underpins them.
878800	884800	And that's the sort of crucial move in what we call the blind spot, is this treatment of what
886720	890800	comes about through a certain method, let's call it a method of objectification, which is a very
890800	896400	powerful and very useful method. We're not arguing against the method as such, but when you forget
896480	903840	that it's a method and you take it for the being of what you're studying in a way that makes that
903840	911840	being more fundamental than the experience that's animating the method, then what you've done is,
911840	917600	and here we really rely on Husserl in the crisis of European science, you substitute a method for
917600	923360	being, which is like a category error, and Husserl calls this the surreptitious substitution.
924320	929440	You substitute a method that you've arrived at, Husserl identifies it as arising really most
929440	936880	powerfully in Galileo, where Galileo imagines the world with no sentient creatures. He then
938000	945120	treats nature in terms of mathematical properties, where the mathematical properties,
946000	950160	the method for him is geometry, the mathematical properties are then taken to be the actual
950160	957920	being and reality of the universe from a god's eye point of view that sees the language in which
957920	965120	nature is written. That move of substituting a method for being, that's the surreptitious
965120	971280	substitution that's built into the blind spot. The connection to whitehead is that whitehead,
972960	976880	there's two concepts in whitehead that are important for us. For whiteheadians out there,
976880	983680	I would say that we're really working here from what is sometimes called whitehead's middle period,
983680	988880	so the concept of nature is a really important book for us, and also science in the modern world,
988880	994080	which is a little bit later. Whitehead says there's, in the epistemology that gets attached
994720	999760	to modern science, or to natural philosophy, you could say there's a bifurcation of nature,
1000960	1005680	where we say, as Galileo did, what's objective and fundamentally real are the
1005680	1010560	mathematical properties, and the qualities, the lived experience, that's subjective.
1011840	1016320	In a way, it gets kicked outside of nature. That's the bifurcation. It gets kicked outside,
1016320	1022160	because if nature is that which is mathematical, and those qualities have to be removed in order
1022160	1026160	to mathematicalize nature, then what are you going to do with those qualities that are residing,
1026160	1033360	as it were in the mind? Well, the mind then gets excised from nature. Whitehead is insistent on
1033360	1039520	saying, even from the standpoint of natural philosophy, you cannot do that, because the
1039520	1046080	lived, sensuous qualities belong to nature. The task is to create a system of relations
1048480	1055520	that treats them on the same level playing field and integrates them. To think that
1056320	1062080	the abstractions, the mathematical abstractions, are what nature really is. Whitehead calls that
1062080	1067920	the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, because you've got an abstraction that you concretize,
1067920	1074080	and no, what's concrete is, in Whitehead's terms, it's the sensuous experience or the sense
1074080	1080320	awareness in which nature is given to us in terms of passage and duration and flow out of which we
1080320	1087200	abstract things like space, time, continuum, and so on. That's what we set up in the beginning
1087200	1092000	of the book, where the blind spot, just to maybe succinctly summarize it, the blind spot is
1092000	1098160	the inability to see or to recognize or to acknowledge that lived experience is the source of
1098160	1108000	science. If you undercut the source of science by occluding lived experience, this is central to
1108000	1115280	our argument, you're actually damaging science, because you're removing the epistemic footing
1115280	1124000	that it needs to be the powerful investigative method it is. What happens is you get this
1124880	1129920	symptomatic of the meaning crisis in our culture, you get this oscillation between the extreme of
1129920	1134560	science triumphalism, which is science is the greatest method ever, and the world is what
1134560	1139680	science tells us it is, on the one hand, and then you get science denial, on the other hand,
1139680	1143920	because a very natural reaction to science triumphalism is to say, well, that's not how I
1143920	1150000	experience the world, regardless of what you say, and in a world of rapid transmission of
1150000	1156160	information and misinformation and willful misleading of people, that oscillation between
1156160	1161200	science triumphalism and science denial becomes particularly problematic and pernicious.
1162240	1164160	That's sort of the setup of the book at the very beginning.
1164960	1173040	That was great. That oscillation is, I mean, it also comes to the fore in some ways in
1174880	1178720	it. I don't know if it's the same, but it resonates with the oscillation. We have an
1178720	1183360	instability in our sense of realness. We have these two, right? We have the mathematical sense
1183360	1189280	of realness and Descartes played with both to no resolution, or we have this, you know, the core
1189280	1194960	of where consciousness is present to itself as what is most real, and we also vacillate between
1194960	1200320	those. I don't know if they are identical, but at least they seem to be tracking also between
1200320	1205760	science triumphalism and science denialism. I thought that was beautiful. It sounds like you're,
1205760	1211760	and this is a bit of Nishita in it, you're picking up on that the blind spot, we're not only
1214080	1220800	unaware of it, but it is also simultaneously the source of our ability to see.
1222080	1229040	You're right, right? Because the optic, right? And Nishitani builds on this. It's the not the
1229040	1238640	thing that makes it accessible to us and that sort of thing. So that move is really interesting to
1238640	1245360	me. This idea of grounding, and you use that term a couple of times in source, you use that term a lot.
1247040	1252800	So what would you say to somebody who says, well, what do you mean? I mean,
1253360	1258480	isn't there a difference between the epistemological order of how I come to
1259120	1264560	knowledge and the ontological order of what that knowledge discloses? Yeah, I have to start in sense
1264560	1273920	experience and etc, etc. But that doesn't mean that that ordering of my epistemological endeavor is
1273920	1280000	the same as the order of reality or how it unfolds. I know that you're ready for this, but I want to
1280000	1283760	hear what you have to say about it. Sure, sure. Well, this depends on what ordering means. So
1286640	1293120	I mean, at one level, it certainly is something that needs to be recognized that the
1294560	1301760	procedure by which we disclose something is one thing, and that which is disclosed is another thing.
1302320	1307840	The ordering, though, if it's a hierarchical ordering in terms of
1307840	1316320	fundamentals goes beyond just that recognition, because it says what's ontologically fundamental
1317600	1324960	is, let's say, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the properties as
1324960	1334080	mathematical. And the experience is derivative. The problem with that ordering is that
1336080	1340640	the mathematical properties exist at a different level of intelligibility
1342160	1348160	from the concrete phenomena. And they are, if you will, the map and the territory is the
1348240	1356720	concrete phenomena. And if you, if you assume that the territory just is the particular map
1356720	1363520	in the way that you're able to render it using, you know, the tools of, of objectification and
1363520	1372240	mathematics, that's, that's actually to not see that. So let me give a concrete illustration,
1372240	1375840	because this is a very abstract way of putting it. So, so one of the things we talk about is time.
1376640	1384320	And so we have the idea that, you know, from a, from the standpoint of physics clock, you know,
1384320	1393200	time is what clocks measure. That's fine as a method. But if you then say, well, what time is
1393200	1399440	is what a clock measures, you've forgotten that there needs to be clock readers, and they exist
1399520	1407760	in some window of duration, that's, that's a continuous flow that disappears if you, if you
1408320	1414800	try to reconstruct it in terms of, you know, point-like instance and clock readings. So
1414800	1421040	So I want to make sure I'm tracking. You're saying something like there's a kind of time
1421040	1425440	in clock reading that is presupposed in measuring time with a clock.
1425520	1431760	Exactly. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So, so there was just a review of the blind spot in
1432320	1438560	LA review of books by Robert Crease, who's a philosopher of physics, also writes, you know,
1438560	1444320	general books about, about science. And he had a wonderful statement that I, that I wish we had
1444320	1449680	actually thought of. And let me see if I can, if I can, if I can get it exactly. So he, he says,
1449680	1457760	describing our view, no one pulls out a clock to know what time is, they pull out a clock to
1457760	1463680	know what time it is. So that's basically the idea, right? You already have to have some
1465360	1471520	experience of time. And you might say sort of to use a, use a phenomenological term, a kind of,
1471520	1478240	you know, pre-understanding of time in order to be able to recognize a clock as at all relevant
1478240	1485600	to, you know, to the, to the subject phenomenon that you're immersed in. So the ordering, so the
1485600	1490400	just to go back to the ordering point. So the ordering is, is, is what we object to is the
1490400	1495200	sort of hierarchical ordering in terms of fundamentality, where we say experience is not
1495200	1502560	fundamental, or what's disclosed to us of the world in how we experience it is derivative,
1502560	1509040	not fundamental. And what's fundamental is what we, what we're able to reveal through,
1509920	1511840	through say, mathematical models.

1533920	1538800	Okay, so there's two moves here, and I like both of them, because I've advocated for both of them.
1538800	1543280	So I hope, I hope this isn't just two members of the choir performing in front of the minister
1543280	1548640	or something like that. That's okay too. Because I've talked about, you know, even a naturalist
1548640	1553120	should be committed not only to what is derivable from your science, but what is presupposed by
1553120	1557520	the practice of your science. And that's exactly what you seem to be saying. You're right. Greg
1557520	1564400	Enriquez and I talk about that as extended naturalism. Right. And then the next one is,
1564400	1569200	and then this one may be, may be more controversial, but it sort of follows from the
1570880	1577760	first, there's an implicit judgment of realness. And I think, well, I hope you agree,
1577760	1584320	I take real as a comparative adjective, right. You know, Marla, people from Plato to Marla
1584320	1588960	Pondida Whitehead have said, you only judge one thing as an illusion by judging something
1588960	1594000	else as real. It's always comparative and vice versa. And so what I was hearing something like
1594000	1600560	fundamental, implying something like more real, and the idea is, I'm not happy with this term,
1600560	1605440	and we'll play with them a little bit later, but the concrete is more real than the abstract.
1605440	1610240	Because of something like, and you say this multiple times too, there's a richness, there's an
1610320	1616960	inexhaustible-ness to that. And this is the point about the map territory kind of,
1616960	1624080	the territory is way richer, has an inexhaustible, it overflows any particular map, even a globe,
1624080	1631920	even a Earth-Science globe, et cetera, et cetera. Is that, that's very, so for me,
1631920	1635840	just as we're sort of putting cards on the table, that's the influence of Polania on me. He was
1635840	1641120	proposing that as the mark of what he calls contact with reality. And Esther, like Kat Mead,
1641120	1646000	has talked about that in her book of the same title. This inexhaustible-ness, but it's not
1646000	1650960	carcophonist inexhaustible, and we'll play with that a little bit. It's kind of like an inexhaustible
1650960	1657680	fountain of intelligibility, right? And so is that, is that, is that what I think of it?
1657680	1665200	Yeah, so that's very much it. I mean, another way that I think of it is that our being always
1665200	1672640	is more than or overflows our knowing, because knowing happens through certain means,
1672640	1677440	through certain methods, through certain sensory systems, through certain forms of
1677440	1682960	intelligibility, and our being is always larger than that. It always overflows that, yeah.
1683680	1688240	So that would, that's wonderful, Evan. I've got to slow down. I'm very enthusiastic.
1688800	1695600	So that, that means that, well, let me form it as a question. Is it possible that one,
1695600	1700400	because I've made an argument that one of the contributors to the meaning crisis is we've reduced
1701280	1706480	many kinds of knowing that have many different kinds of memory attached to them, procedural,
1706480	1711360	episodic, autonometric, have different criteria of realness to them, skill is power,
1712320	1716560	you know, perspectival knowing is sort of like noticing, getting that sense of,
1716560	1720880	you know, getting deeper into things, more present to them. And then the participatory
1720880	1727360	knowing is the sense of sort of belonging, fittedness to your environment. And what I mean by that
1727360	1734560	is part of, I hear you saying this, but I want to frame it, like our practice, we've reduced what
1735280	1741440	knowing is, and we forgot, when we do that, we've forgot the ultimate responsibility of
1741440	1746240	knowing to being, like particularly our being, but also being in general, like we forgot that
1746240	1752800	there are ways of knowing that are more, or are closer metaphor to our being in the world than
1752800	1758720	these mathematical abstractions. Is that also tracking? Oh, definitely. Yeah, no, definitely. I think
1762720	1766560	there are different kinds of knowing, there are different modes of knowing, I suppose you might
1766560	1777120	say, different ways of delineating those, of course, too. And it's, because science is so
1777120	1787760	transformatively powerful, in its outward, you know, obvious manifestations, we have defaulted
1787760	1792720	to thinking, and I mean, you see this explicitly in Descartes, right? We have defaulted to thinking
1792720	1799520	that knowing is a matter of having a method. And that's true for some methods of knowing.
1801360	1807520	But even the application of a method presupposes something that you can't, you know,
1808640	1812800	state in terms of a method, right? I mean, this is a familiar kind of thing for philosophers.
1813520	1822000	Yeah. So, yeah, no, that's right. There's a kind of acquaintance, you could say,
1822800	1827520	that we have with our being, that is not a matter of having a method. That acquaintance is not
1827520	1831440	unproblematic, of course. I mean, all sorts of questions arise in relation to that, you know,
1831440	1835200	normative questions, existential questions, philosophical questions, ethical, political, of
1835200	1842400	course. But it's the background for the application of any method, exactly.
1843040	1847360	Well, I was smiling because, and I know you're aware of this, because you treated about it,
1847360	1854000	you know, with Johannes Yeager and Anna Riedel and Aldrich Bedwick and Dennis Walsh.
1855040	1860720	We're trying to get a paper published on how you can't ultimately, you can't capture relevance
1860720	1865920	realization in computation for exactly that reason, that the process of formalization of
1865920	1870400	translating things into a formal system is always an ill-defined problem that requires
1870400	1875360	relevance realization. And that sort of, I mean, there's a lot more to that paper, but that's the
1875360	1882560	core kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, no, I love that paper and I completely agree and sympathize with
1882560	1889920	the argument. Yeah. Now, what's interesting, excellent answer to that question. So, I'm going
1889920	1894160	to throw out these, like, devil's advocate things and then you do this wonderful thing and we get
1894160	1899760	into some nice discussion. Well, somebody will say, bifurcation, come on, we've always bifurcated,
1899760	1905760	because we have to and we do, even in our lived experience, readily and reliably make
1905760	1911360	distinguishing distinctions between appearance and reality, fraud and reality, illusion and
1911360	1917600	reality, delusion and reality, hallucination and reality, right? And yeah, maybe we cut it up as
1917600	1923040	a subjective and objective, but the ancient world cut it up into the problem of the one in the mini.
1923120	1931040	We're always building these worldviews, trying to somehow give us a normative guide for how we
1931040	1938960	discern, you know, reality from appearance. And so, isn't a bifurcation an inevitable thing,
1938960	1951680	therefore? Yeah, so, of course, we always live in a world where we have to make distinctions
1951680	1957680	between, you know, the appearance of something and, as we say, how it really is. But if we think
1957680	1964800	about how that works, the test, the criterion, the standard for how something really is, is
1964800	1971280	disclosed in and through another experience. So, it's not that we step outside of experience and
1971280	1978400	we have some absolute standard or metric by which we can say, this is real and that isn't real. It's
1978400	1984960	rather that we continually open up new vistas, new horizons in experience where the relationship
1984960	1991760	between appearance and reality shifts within the sphere of experience itself. So, that's not really
1992800	2002000	bifurcation in Whitehead sense. That's a sort of progressive changing of appearances, perspectives,
2002000	2010080	you know, profiles, aspects of things where what we take to be true or real is something
2010800	2015680	disclosed, again, through experience where Whitehead, when he uses the term bifurcation
2015680	2024320	of nature, really means you kick experience out of the framework of scientific, the framework
2024320	2028720	of the scientific representation of nature. And then, and we know this very well today in terms
2028720	2033600	of the hard problem of consciousness, then you face a very, very fundamentally difficult problem
2033600	2043920	of how to recover consciousness, awareness, the mind. And the hard problem is that problem.
2043920	2050000	It's a problem that that derives in a way from the bifurcation of nature in the way that we state
2050000	2054880	the problem today, which is, you know, how is consciousness possible in a purely physical
2054880	2060720	world where we conceive the purely physical in terms of this bifurcation of, you know, a
2060720	2069360	mathematical, quantitative nature, that then somehow we have to find a room for the qualia,
2069360	2074880	the qualitative properties, the phenomenality, the appearances. And then we either, we do that by
2074880	2078880	either trying to, you know, be reductionist and say, well, it just really is physicality
2079440	2083600	in the face of the obvious sort of problem of conceptual intelligibility there.
2083600	2088880	Or we say, well, it actually is an illusion itself. We sort of go the illusionist route.
2088880	2094160	And then we strain at the intelligibility of the concept of an illusion. Or we, you know,
2094160	2099440	or we go panpsychist and we say, well, there's a sense in which consciousness and some minimal,
2099440	2104560	phenomenal sense is sort of an ingredient everywhere at all levels. So we sort of like
2105280	2109520	having sucked the consciousness out, we then sort of like spray it back into the universe
2109520	2115360	as it were everywhere. And that doesn't really work either. So that's the bifurcation. So,
2115360	2120560	so yes, of course, we have to make distinctions between appearance and reality, genuine counterfeit.
2121360	2124560	But we always do that within a framework of the test of experience.
2125200	2129440	So that's the key move. And I liked that. That was a great answer. And there was a moment in the
2129440	2134160	book. Sorry, I don't mean to indicate it was the only moment in the book. There was one moment
2134160	2139120	in the book, one among many, where I was, I was looking at this and I said, oh, I never put those
2139120	2144320	two together. I, you know, I talk, obviously, about, you know, the relationship to God and
2144320	2148800	the two worlds mythology. But you did this, you made this move where you said, you know, the thing
2148800	2155200	about the idea of this, I don't know what to call it, you know, the monarchical God or something
2155200	2162800	like that God, even when that God disappeared, we preserved the placeholder function of the
2162800	2171120	view from nowhere, right? And in there. And so what I hear you critiquing is that view from
2171120	2177200	nowhere possibility. It's like, yes, yes, there's reality, illusion, reality distinctions, but you
2177200	2184320	never are in the place from nowhere, no when to make that distinction. Is that, is that a fair way?
2184320	2191200	That's right. Exactly. I mean, if you read, if you read Newton or Galileo, you have this
2192160	2201040	this conception, a particular kind of conception of God as, as able to, you know, behold everything
2201040	2207200	at all times from all possible perspectives. You know, Newton says that, you know, space is God's
2207200	2213920	sensorium. So there's a sense of God can, can contemplate, you know, every, every possible
2214640	2221360	perspective of a thing in space. You, you have a, you have a conception of, of the outside view
2221360	2228640	and science, you know, is, it may never achieve that, but that's it's, it's ideal in a way.
2228640	2232160	And so that is very much what we're, what we're criticizing is no, that that's,
2233840	2239600	that's not how science works. And it's not how knowledge works. It's not how experience works.
2240240	2246480	So, so that's really good. And I want to, I want to, I want to shift back into Nishita just for a
2246480	2253680	sec. I forget where it's in Nishita, but Carter talks about it in his beautiful book, The Nothingness
2253680	2257920	Beyond God. He talks about Nishita's distinction between the transcendent, transcendent and the
2257920	2263120	imminent transcendent. Right. Right. Right. Because you, well, you qualified something,
2263120	2266480	and I think it was good that you did because some of my people listening to this,
2267440	2271600	you're, you're not the village atheist or something like that. That's not what's being
2271600	2278560	argued for here. And so, and I hear you're saying, well, that conception, the transcendent,
2278560	2284720	transcendent, that, that is probably given this argument, a performative contradiction of some
2284720	2290320	kind. Like it's, it's ultimately not conceivable to us, not just because we're limited or finite,
2290320	2295280	but because it is inherently, it severs itself from the very sources of meaning and understanding.
2295280	2300960	Is that, is that, that is, yeah. Whereas there's something like the notion of the imminent
2300960	2306160	transcendence, which you get, of course, in, in Whitehead, right? You have the, the emergence,
2306160	2310080	right? You, you have, and we can talk about whether or not you still like this language,
2310080	2314000	but you know, you have the eternal and the emergent and they're constantly resonating with
2314000	2320160	each other, but they're always bound together. Whitehead says, you know, God transcends the
2320160	2324480	world to the same degree that the world transcends God and God is imminent in the world to the same
2324480	2328880	degree the world is imminent in God. And I think that's very aligned with what Nashid is trying to
2328880	2336800	get at. Now, so you aren't responsible to every possible audience. I get that. But a lot of people
2336800	2342000	come to this and I think this is a fair point around the meaning crisis and they come to this
2342000	2346800	around the issue of sacredness because they say, yes, you're talking about reality and you're talking
2346800	2353200	about things can be more real. I can be closer. I can be more in conformity to it. I can live a,
2353200	2358400	perhaps a fuller life, a more responsible life. And there's a sense that that could even be sacred.
2358400	2363200	It could afford transforming me, making me a better person. And, you know, both Whitehead has,
2363200	2370320	has a God and Nashida talks a lot about God and he certainly has a sacred in it. So I know you're
2370320	2374800	not a theologian and I'm not, I'm not trying to bend you into something, but I think this is a fair
2374800	2379520	question. Because these questions around the meaning crisis bring up issues around, you know,
2379520	2384640	about sacredness and ultimacy. And what would you say about that? Would you say that?
2386240	2391760	Yeah, because there's a parallel. This is all final proposal for before I shut up and let you
2391760	2396800	answer the question. There's a parallel with religious denial and religious triumphalism,
2396800	2401680	I think, in a certain way. And, and maybe, you know, and you're, you're trying to get out of the one.
2402720	2408400	And I, I, I agree with you on that, the science and you're trying, and I've been trying to get
2408400	2413040	out of the other. And I'm wondering if you see relationship between them, particularly because
2413040	2418160	we're, and I want to get into this with you at some point. I think this meaning, what psychologists
2418160	2423040	call meaning in life, not semantic meaning, but this sense of connectedness to reality is what's
2423040	2429280	behind, you know, our judgments of what is, you know, most real and most sacred, most important
2429280	2434560	for us, etc. Do you think those two problems talk to each other? I know you don't, I haven't
2434880	2438560	like a whole book, maybe you talk about it in other places in the book, but do you think about it?
2438560	2443280	Yeah, no, those are really interesting thoughts and questions. That definitely goes beyond what
2443280	2447280	we talk about in the book. So we don't, I mean, I'm happy to talk about it here, but just, just
2448160	2452000	to be clear about the book, it's not, we don't really enter into issues about,
2454080	2461280	you might say larger issues about meaning that connect to, to religion or to the sacred or to
2461280	2467280	spirituality. You know, we may be allude to the certain aspects of them here and there,
2467280	2471520	but they're not, they're not a really dominant theme in the book that, you know, the book is
2471520	2477600	really circumscribed by the, by the effort to, you know, help us get clear about what science is
2477600	2482800	and how science works. But that, of course, immediately raises the question from, you know,
2482800	2488320	a larger perspective of how to think about science in relationship to philosophy or religion or to
2488480	2502000	issues about, about the sacred. This is difficult, you know, in a way to know exactly how to enter,
2502000	2506640	because, you know, the word, the word sacred can mean different things. The word, you know,
2506640	2511600	the word God can mean different things like whitehead has a very idiosyncratic
2511760	2519200	conception of God. I mean, it's been generative for process theology, but, but it's, it's, it's,
2519200	2522880	it's an outlying conception, even within the realm of theology.
2524640	2531280	So I would do how I'm using it and maybe and see if that's good enough. And I'm deeply influenced
2531280	2537840	here by a fellow Canadian, Schellenberg, and his idea of the triple transcendent. The sacred is
2537840	2544320	that which is, in some sense, ultimately real for us. It is ultimately transformative for us. It
2544320	2549600	has a sodorological function. It's not just an intellectual ascent. And then it has an
2549600	2556480	axiological, it serves as kind of an ultimate normative guide for us in some way and making
2556480	2563280	our ethical and aesthetic, even epistemological judgments. And, and, and, and other people
2563280	2567200	like Bracken and the Divine Matrix seem to be arguing that I'm not, I'm not saying this
2567200	2572480	is going to satisfy everybody, but maybe it's enough of a core so that we got something to work
2572480	2578480	with in answering the question I'm posing to you. Yeah. I guess the way that I have been
2578480	2584720	thinking about that recently, so that this isn't really worked out for me in a thorough way, but,
2584720	2588800	but, but I have thought about these things, you know, more in actually in relation to the
2588800	2593600	writings that I've done about Buddhism and religion and science in my, in my earlier book,
2593600	2596480	Why I'm Not a Buddhist. So there's an issue I would say about,
2597120	2600720	You're going to come on my show and talk to me about that book when I get to that book. I've had
2600720	2604800	that book on my shelf for a while and I apologize for that. But yeah, no worries. Yeah. Yeah. No,
2604800	2611200	that would be fun. So we might, we might use Tillick's idea of, you know, faith as ultimate
2611200	2616160	concern, like not to say that it has to stop there, but we can take that idea as an entry point.
2616160	2622320	I like Tillick a lot as you know, he's big. Yeah. So ultimate concern,
2624400	2628240	or, you know, we could, we could use the word sacred to mean ultimate concern as well. So,
2628240	2637680	so, you know, faith, sacred, ultimate concern. For me, one issue really has to do with a juxtaposition
2637760	2647600	between what Martin Hoagland calls secular faith. So this is the idea of faith in our, in our being
2649040	2655760	as faith in our finitude, faith in the life we share together as finite beings, you know,
2655760	2660880	under the, under the horizon of death or within the, you know, the limit of the horizon of death,
2661440	2665920	the kind of existential secular conception of ultimate concern, where ultimate concern
2665920	2671040	really has to be grounded in, in this life and, and this world that we, that we share with each
2671040	2682240	other. Good, good. Whereas the notion of transcendence can be used in a way that would, that would,
2682240	2686480	that would be juxtaposed to that where transcendence would mean something like
2687200	2702320	a state either of liberation or freedom or release that takes us beyond or outside this life.
2703280	2706480	Transcendence doesn't have to be used that way because you could have a transcendence in
2706480	2713360	imminence again within this, you know, within this life. But when used that way, which I think is,
2713920	2722160	is one fundamental sense of transcendence we see running through lots of different religious traditions,
2723680	2726640	then I don't see,
2730560	2735520	it's not that I want to deny that because I think for many people that's important and meaningful
2737040	2742320	but it wouldn't be how I would articulate the sacred or ultimate concern.
2743200	2748800	Right. And so there's a diss, I mean, and I've realized I've made an error sometimes in making
2748800	2752560	this a hard and fast distinction, it's more of a continuum, but there is a distinction to be made
2752560	2757520	between something being indispensable to somebody and somebody claiming it's sort of metaphysically
2757520	2763840	necessary in some fashion. The example I use is I'm, I'm monolingual, so English is indispensable
2763840	2770080	to my cognitive agency. That doesn't mean it's metaphysically necessary. And so I think,
2770640	2778080	I think that's how I sort of parse what you're doing. And I agree with you, the sacred does not
2778720	2784400	obligate us to any kind of escapism because behind the escapism is a two worlds mythology
2784400	2787920	and then we have the problem of the bifurcation and then we're getting into back to the very place
2787920	2795840	we're trying to get from. And I agree with that. That's a mistake. But here's like, so for example,
2795840	2798640	the meaning in life literature, you want to ask people if they have meaning in life, you can
2798640	2804320	ask them these three questions. And like, and like, what do you want to exist even if you don't?
2805040	2808720	Sorry, say that question again. What do you want to exist even if you don't?
2808720	2814080	Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. How real is it? And sometimes you put in the qualifier,
2814080	2818640	how really real is it? Because what do you mean, right? And then, and then how much of a difference
2818640	2823600	do you make to it right now? If you got, if you got something, it doesn't have to be an object,
2823600	2828880	obviously, if you have something that, you know, this is Susan Wolf's, this is trying to, you know,
2828880	2833680	break out into a questionnaire Susan Wolf's idea of being connected to something larger than yourself.
2833680	2836880	Right. What that metaphor means is, well, people want this thing,
2838800	2842560	like they want it to be in the universe, even if they're not, it's not, it's not in any way
2842560	2849520	bound to their egocentric preferences. Right. Right. And then the next one is, right. It can't
2849520	2854480	be fraudulent. It can't be mere appearance. It can't be superficial. It has to have significance
2854480	2859760	in depth. And then, and then the next is, but we have to be connected to it. We have to make a
2859760	2866480	difference to it. And so, so remember, I agree with everything you said, and I sort of ran through
2866480	2875280	that, the argument with you about it. But how do you, I'm going to express sympathy. I can express,
2875280	2880160	and let me buttress this. Okay. So you're, you're in the Axial Revolution. You've got Bella's second
2880160	2886080	order thinking your, your metacognition has been massively improved by numeracy with what the Greeks
2886080	2891040	are doing with alphabetic literacy. You've got incipient democracy. So debate is everywhere,
2891040	2895760	hyper justification, and you've got a shared culture, but many different polices. So you have all
2895760	2901040	the six social experimentation, and this is really blowing your metacognitive abilities up. Right.
2901040	2907280	And so you're getting just a tremendous awareness of your capacities for self deception. And then
2907280	2911840	you're liable to think, oh, you know, and you can see this in Plato, you can, you can even see it
2911840	2916400	outside of Greece. You can see it like in the Dhammapada, but, you know, the right and things
2916400	2921840	like this, that, you know, this realization about how much of our suffering and violence is due to
2921840	2929440	this self deceptive proclivity of the mind. And then you could start to conceive of a world that,
2930880	2935840	how the world would be if you weren't looking at it through that torture of self deception and
2935840	2941600	self destruction. And then you could plug into this, this other thing we said, you've got that's,
2941600	2946560	it's being connected to that is deeply meaningful to you. And you somehow have a sense of it being
2946560	2954400	beyond your life, right, and beyond your egocentric concerns. And so I'm not justifying, I'm trying
2954400	2959280	to play with an explanation with you. It's very tempting to give into a two rules mythology,
2959280	2963680	that is just such a wonderful way of explaining all of that and drawing it together.
2965200	2971840	Yeah, no, that's right. And I think, you know, they're, they're different cultural forms
2972400	2980640	that, that that takes. So, you know, say in India, where in the, you know, the Vedas, we don't really
2980640	2988160	see the, the idea of rebirth or, or, you know, reincarnation, as we sometimes say, we, we have
2988160	2995120	a cosmology in which, you know, there may be, you know, higher, more divine kind of transformative
2995120	3002640	states or possibilities after death that have to do with, with divinities and, and, you know,
3002640	3008960	the sort of sacred order of the cosmos. And then we have this idea that we have this sort of
3008960	3015840	ethicization of action, where the idea is, you know, if you act, you know, in a good way, then,
3015840	3020320	you know, the possibility of a more refined transformative after death state is open to
3020320	3026240	you. If you act in a bad way, then it's going to go worse for you after death. And, and so we,
3026240	3030880	we have this sort of, you could say kind of two world, if we, if we slice it in terms of, you
3030880	3037440	know, life here and what happens after, you know, after death. And then we have the idea that
3039120	3043760	of karma that we see really first in the Upanishads, where it's, you know, because of desire,
3043760	3048400	you're actually thrown back from that other world into this world. And then it goes round and round
3048720	3053040	and that becomes an existential problem that has to be, you know, has to be solved. And then we get,
3053040	3059120	you know, the different solutions to it on the part of, you know, Buddhism and, and,
3059120	3063520	you know, the Buddhist teachings or, or what later come to be called Hindu teachings.
3063520	3069920	So that's all part of this axial, this axial transformation in our, in our consciousness,
3069920	3075280	in our metacognition, in our cosmology, in our ethics, definitely. And
3075280	3079040	well, let me phrase the question. Since we've landed on sort of a, I like the way you broadened
3079040	3084960	it, because I want the cross, cross contextual, cross historical, right? Given that something
3084960	3094000	like that, let's like, like that, how do we preserve the recognizable gains? There's a
3094000	3099920	change in the notion of wisdom to, to, like you said, this, this kind of liberation, maybe escape,
3099920	3104640	but transformation from, you know, maybe a bronze age, you know, Taylor talks about,
3104640	3108880	you know, the continuous cosmos and you're trying to fit in and harmonize, right? It's a,
3108880	3114800	it's a very, it's a very different notion of wisdom. How do we preserve what was gained
3115360	3118640	by us? And you know, I'm going to obviously ask the same thing when we come to the scientific
3118640	3127200	revolution. How do we, how do we preserve what was gained by the axial revolution? Well, can we,
3127280	3130800	can we preserve that? Let's say we, we agree we want to preserve it. I'm presuming here,
3130800	3134160	but let's say we want to preserve a lot of what was gained by that, all the metacognitive
3134160	3139280	enhancements, all the sense of individual responsibility, right? Etc. The realization
3139280	3143920	of self deception, the possibility of self correction. How do we, how do we maintain all
3143920	3148880	of that? Or can we, I'll phrase it a question, better question, can we maintain all of that? And
3149840	3154240	I don't know, tear it free. And I'm trying to use a somewhat violent metaphor from
3154240	3158800	the two worlds of mythology. I mean, it's, it's almost, and, and, and, you know, part of this
3158800	3163840	also plugs into even our, you know, our conceptual metaphors and our embodiment, real is more up,
3164560	3169680	less real is down. And like, I'm peeling up today and you're looking down at all this kind of language
3169680	3176480	and we abstract and the abstract is above and the concrete is like, like it's, it's, it's so woven
3176480	3182640	culturally and even like into, you know, plugs into our embodiment in a powerful way.
3183280	3188400	I think we can, but I want to hear what you, do you perceive the difficulty of the problem?
3188400	3196960	Oh, certainly. I mean, that is, that is a huge question. You might say a part of the big historical
3196960	3201760	question for our, for our times and the, and the, you know, the crisis of meaning that we
3201760	3207360	face as, as you've talked about it. And, and I see it, you know, it's hard not to sort of go
3207360	3214320	Hegelian here, but, but I'm going to give in to the temptation. I see it, I see it in a way as,
3215680	3218000	you know, that was a, that was a hugely transformative
3221040	3228480	revolution, let's call it, you know, the Axial Revolution. And we might also think that things
3228480	3233280	were lost in that. So we might think that a certain relationship to the natural world
3234160	3243920	was lost. And we're now especially conscious of the need to restore some viable,
3245840	3250240	I'll even say sustainable, though it's become a buzzword, some viable, sustainable relationship
3250240	3257760	between the human and the, and the rest of the biosphere that requires, I think, an affirmation
3257760	3263520	of the, the, the specialness of our earth environment. You know, yes, there are in, so
3263520	3267760	Marcelo Gleiser's book, The Dawn of a Mindful Universe is about this. It's, you know, yes,
3267760	3272880	there are, you know, inordinately many planets out there that might be able to support life,
3272880	3279520	but a critical examination also suggests that there might actually be very, very few that have
3279520	3283840	life. And if life is a special thing that's happened here, at least in the way that it's
3283920	3290480	happened here, then, you know, the sacred and ultimate concern has to involve our being in
3290480	3296240	relationship to the, to the biosphere. And we have to do it in a way that involves all of the
3296240	3302720	ethical cognitive gains that we made as a were of, from the Axial Revolution, you know, telescoping,
3302720	3306880	you know, huge historical time here. But we also have to do it in a way that recovers a kind of
3308080	3312560	sensibility to the, and relationship to the natural world that there would have been
3312560	3318080	pre-agricultural, at least according to some historical narratives. We need, we don't, we
3318080	3323680	can't go back to that, of course, that's absurd, but we need to recover something of that in a new,
3323680	3330080	so the way this is Hegelian is it's like a higher turn of the spiral. This would be how my dad would
3330080	3335520	have put it, actually, is that, you know, you have this course, a recourse of history, and you never
3335520	3340000	repeat the same thing, but there are patterns where at a certain turning of the spiral, you
3340000	3346640	actually can look down and see, you know, the axial turn, you know, the, the, the, the turn that
3346640	3351040	would have been or the curve that would have been before the axial. And from that perspective, you
3351040	3357360	need to, you need to recover things that were lost because there's always something lost as well
3357360	3361280	when you, when you have a, when you have a gain. And that, you know, the amazing thing about science,
3361280	3366160	just to bring it back to the book for a moment, is that, you know, with, with things like the
3366160	3372560	Gaia theory and earth system science, we've opened up a whole new appreciation of, you know, that we
3372560	3377280	don't live on the planet, we live in the planet that were embedded at so many levels in the very
3377280	3386800	fabric of life on the planet. And that is it, is it, you know, to really, to really be with that in a,
3386800	3392720	in a, in an ethical way requires a kind of profound, I think, change in our, in our sensibility,
3393600	3400800	that, that science gives us some of the tools for not all of them, but some of them. And the other
3400800	3406320	things are going to need to come from, you know, larger perspectives of ethics and the sacred,
3408480	3412480	you know, religion and spirituality, art. I mean, the world is a lot bigger than science,
3412480	3419760	right, the human cultural world. Yeah. Well, that brings up two things. One is, of course,
3420320	3425440	I assume you're making a similar argument about the scientific revolution that there was a lot
3425440	3428720	lost. I mean, that's what the book is saying. That's right. That's right. And, but you're not
3428720	3436880	proposing nostalgia. I get that. Definitely not. And so the thing you said about that, that, that met,
3436880	3444480	that, so it's not only a looking back through the eyes of history, it's also looking around
3444480	3450720	through eyes other than the eyes of science, art, ritual, all different ways of knowing,
3450720	3457360	different ways of being together, of being in the world, looking, you know, looking from within,
3457360	3461760	not looking at, but looking from within nature, Ursula Goodnuff's notion of transcendence into
3461760	3470560	nature, things like that. And so Whitehead had this idea that we need to recover, almost in Tolkien's
3470640	3479600	sense of recover, we need to recover art and ritual and all of this and somehow bring it back
3479600	3485680	into having a proper role within our epistemological and ontological endeavors. That's clearly
3485680	3491040	sort of a thing that Whitehead is arguing. Does that land for you too? Oh, definitely. Yeah.
3491040	3495360	Okay. Okay. And here's where we're maybe trespassing on Matt's work, Matt Seagal,
3495360	3500000	especially his most recent book. But you know, and this where I'm influenced somewhat by
3500000	3505600	Habermas, right? You know, Kant basically severs the true and the good and the beautiful from each
3505600	3510400	other in really powerful ways with the three critiques and the autonomy arguments for each one
3510400	3518000	of those. And you know, Kant is sort of looming in places in the book here and there. Because
3518720	3524800	you're rejecting both the kind of old Platonism and simple Kantianism about things like math.
3524800	3527920	We'll probably get into that in the next conversation. I don't know if we'll get to it now.
3528640	3534080	But I'm trying to get at what would, at least in a preliminary fashion, and I'm not trying
3534080	3537840	to pin you here. You know, I'm your friend. I want to talk to you about this. How would you
3537840	3542960	address? I mean, that's a hard problem. It's a hard problem. I mean, Habermas has been wrestling with
3542960	3550960	it. He wrestled with it, sorry, right? To, you know, overcoming those arguments that give us the
3550960	3555600	autonomy of the true, the good and beautiful. We have a sense, you know, and David Schindler has
3555600	3560560	been arguing about how they're actually convertible and all that sort of stuff. But how would you,
3560560	3569920	where would you, where would you go to, like, I'm trying to make, I'm trying to make Kant the
3569920	3577280	impediment that you have to address right now. But that's not all of his work, but just this move
3577280	3587840	about, right, the, you know, the separation and making autonomous, including making the
3587840	3592880	individual autonomous with each one of the, within each one of these autonomies of, you know, because
3592880	3599840	of the three critiques. That seems to me like a really powerful thing to be trying to wrestle with
3599840	3603280	philosophically. And the book has a philosophical edge to it. You represent that.
3604080	3608800	Yeah, that's an interesting question. I hadn't quite thought of it in those
3610080	3619760	Kantian terms. I suppose my, you know, my philosophical sensibility is so informed by
3619760	3624800	phenomenology in the sort of, you know, sense coming from, from, from this role. And
3625200	3635840	it doesn't, there's, there's a way of talking about truth, where it's very easy to think of
3635840	3642000	truth as different from the beautiful say. And that's because we think of truth in terms of the
3642000	3647280	correctness of propositions. And we have, we have an idea of correctness really, or of, or of
3647360	3654800	correspondence. But from a phenomenological perspective, that actually is a secondary sense
3654800	3664880	of truth. And the primary sense of truth is, is disclosure, or presence, or the, to be, you
3664880	3670720	know, technical in the way that Husserl uses the terminology, the, you know, the evidencing
3671440	3676080	of something. So evidencing is the, you know, we use evidence as a noun in English. We think
3676080	3680000	here's a piece of evidence, but, but in other languages, evidencing has this verbal sense,
3680000	3686640	where you, you disclose something, you, you uncover it, you reveal it, it comes to presence,
3686640	3691120	you know, Heidegger tries to talk about this in terms of his, his sort of etymological
3692560	3696880	reconstruction of the, you know, the Greek sense of unconcealment of Aletheia, you know,
3696880	3701200	Lethe is the concealment, the alpha privative Aletheia is the unconcealment. So there's this
3701280	3706480	opening, this, the space of unconcealment and openness. And it's within that space that you
3706480	3711040	can then say, in terms of a proposition you might assert that you put in quotation marks,
3711040	3716720	oh, that proposition that you just said, it's correct. That happens against this other sense of
3716720	3722240	truth, which is, you know, unconcealment, presence, openness, evidence, disclosure, you know, however
3722240	3726560	you want to, however you want to put it. So within that context, it's very difficult to make a
3726560	3736160	separation between the, the, the, the, the, the sense of truth as unconcealment and say,
3737360	3745440	the beautiful or other aesthetic, aesthetic properties for that matter, or the just. And
3747520	3751760	so if we think of it that way, we are in a sense going back before Kant, you might say, well,
3751760	3757440	that's going back before the critical philosophy of Kant and, and thinking in, you know, a more
3757440	3763120	Greek way. That's fine. As long as we do it, having taken, you know, the knowledge and the
3763120	3768160	message, if we want to simplify things of Kant on board, you know, it's like, we're not going back
3768160	3772880	in some nostalgic way in the way that Heidegger often writes, in a way that I find actually
3772880	3777760	very distasteful, this kind of nostalgic, artificial German, German romantic sort of
3777760	3782320	projection back into the ancient world. No, we're not doing that. We're, we're taking what
3782320	3788480	we've learned from Kant, but we're moving forward in the way that, say, phenomenologists have taught
3788480	3800240	us to, taught us to do, where again, the, the, the, let's say, the horizon of experience as,
3801120	3808000	as, as presence is the, is the, is the context within which we're, we're going to be talking,
3808800	3812480	where those distinctions don't, can't, can't be made hard and fast in the way that they might
3812480	3817360	have been done, right, in, for, for the Kantian purposes. I want to play with that a little bit.
3817360	3824400	I like that, because I've done similar play, you know, Rikur talks about the hermeneutics of
3824400	3829280	suspicion and that, and I've made the argument the hermeneutics of suspicion is parasitic
3829360	3832800	on what I call the hermeneutics of beauty. The hermeneutics of suspicion is
3833520	3838560	appearances are distorting, misleading, they, they conceal deception, blah, blah. But the
3838560	3844000	hermeneutics of beauty, at least, some people are talking about beauty is, well, no, but there
3844000	3850240	have to be situations in which appearances disclose reality, that appearances is not a veil, right,
3850240	3854400	the way, that's an enlightenment ideal, but, and that beauty is when we're getting a sense,
3854400	3858880	and this, and, and Skari does this in her book on beauty, that it's what we're getting a sense of,
3858880	3863680	oh, oh, it's, and it's, it's bound up with almost like that insight moment where you realize, oh,
3863680	3868160	I haven't been seeing this as, as, as, as it is. And then, so that's beauty, but then that you're
3868160	3872800	already also in like the truth, but you're also getting into this other thing, this sort of,
3872800	3877600	and you get this research from people who have, look at the Griffith lab and others, I know you're
3877600	3881360	familiar with this research, and they have the experience, the noetic experience of the really
3881360	3887520	real, and it seems to have a kind of normativity to them, right, right, that, and it's just, it's
3887520	3893600	just in the fact that it's real, that it's normatively binding on them, like, and they,
3893600	3898480	they transform their lives and their relationships, and they're not guided by at least a Kantian sense
3898480	3903200	of being more moral, and they're not, right, but they're guided, but nevertheless, by this sense
3903200	3908000	of a goodness, I call it, onto normativity, just to give a name to it, somehow there's a goodness
3908080	3915280	to reality, that, and, and you're nodding, you might be just being polite, but is that
3915280	3920080	sort of the kind of thing you're talking about, where you start to unpack these kind of things,
3920080	3924800	and you start to say, well, no, you know, there's a sense of beauty as appearance is disclosing
3924800	3930080	something underneath them, which relates to truth as disclosure, and then there's a sense of goodness
3930080	3936480	as, you know, this contact with the really real as something that's sort of an ur normativity for
3936480	3943600	us. Is that? Yeah, very much so. I mean, I think, you know, in addition to beauty, I would, I would
3943600	3956000	invoke awe and wonder. Sure, of course. Yeah, yeah. I think that it's impossible to separate those
3956000	3962080	things phenomenologically in, in those kinds of experiences and situations that, that people
3962080	3967760	have, including, including science, right? Yeah, I mean, you read what, you know, you read Einstein,
3968320	3976320	you know, writing about, about the, the, the, the worldview that he has as a scientist and the,
3976320	3983520	and, and some of his own, you know, experiences in thinking about his scientific work. You read
3983520	3989840	historical, you know, scientific figures throughout, throughout history, and, and they all, you know,
3989920	3997040	express or many of them express this, this sense of, you know, awe and, and, and wonder and amazement
3997040	4004480	and, and, you know, a feeling of the good transformative insight. And I think there's a deep
4004480	4008240	connection. So I'm really going to lay my cards on the table because I know I can do that with you.
4009360	4012560	But I mean, for me, I, I, I'm very much
4012800	4022000	drawn to mysticism in, as a mode of understanding what's happening there. I think of, you know,
4022000	4029760	science and mysticism as, as deeply linked throughout history in, in, in, in philosophical,
4029760	4034400	cultural and, and, you know, personality ways in terms of individual scientists where,
4035120	4039280	you know, mysticism is this, I think of mysticism almost as a kind of epistemic
4039360	4048880	humility. It's that, you know, the world is, is vast. It's unfathomable. And that there are modes of
4049440	4053040	knowing is not even the right word. There are modes of being in which there is a felt
4054000	4062800	oneness or unity that can be expressed in enumably different ways in, you know, in, in science,
4062800	4068480	in art, in philosophy, and, and mysticism, you know, so, so going back to the sacred,
4068480	4074160	I think of it as a kind of, you know, the need for kind of imminent mysticism, a mysticism of,
4074160	4081360	you know, here and now in this planet, you know, with, with, with the needs that, that face us as
4081360	4086240	a species and as a, as a civilization, as a scientific civilization. So I see the mystic as
4086240	4093520	really almost the, the, you know, the guardian, the reminder, the reminderer, the, the sort of
4094240	4097280	watch person for that sensibility. Yeah.
4098800	4102480	Well, I think you know that I agree with that quite deeply. A lot of my work is about trying
4102480	4108080	to get these two to speak together. And in your own book, The Blind Spot, I was noting the many
4108080	4113120	places where you explained why this was chosen by the scientists, especially in the history
4113120	4117840	chapter, because it was elegant, because it was beautiful, because it was simple. I mean, there's
4117840	4122560	a problem with the notion of simple. We act as if it's a cleanly, cleanly determinable thing,
4122560	4127600	but it's not right. And stuff like that. But there, yeah, there was this tremendous sense of how
4127600	4136400	much that is how that is, you know, driving, motivating and justifying the moves that these
4136400	4140640	scientists are making historically. Yeah. And even, you know, as people have written about,
4142960	4148080	just, you know, just to balance things that that can sometimes lead us astray, you know, we can get
4148080	4153520	caught up in the beauty of the mathematical constructions in a way where we lose, we lose
4153520	4158720	contact with how the world actually is talking back to us. And we, you know, we depart from
4158720	4166080	any real possibility of experiential grounding or confirmation or support. I mean, this happens.
4167120	4171360	You know, so I'm, you know, Marcelo and Adam could talk much more articulately about this,
4171360	4176240	but you know, this happens in, in areas of physics, you know, in string theory or, you know,
4176240	4180400	the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and how people just are willing to
4180400	4184480	run with its metaphysical implications in this sort of profligated indiscriminate way. So that's
4184480	4189920	sort of the flip side is you can get, you can get fascinated by constructions that have a kind of
4189920	4195760	beauty, but that are, but that are misleading in certain ways. For sure. For sure. And
4199040	4203920	it's interesting that maybe we'll leave to when they're present to talk about this more in depth,
4203920	4208160	but you can see sort of both of these impulses, right? You, yeah, you can get the rabbit holding
4208160	4212720	that goes on with strings theory and multiple worlds. And it's just one electron moving all
4212720	4217440	through time and space, encountering itself and like, what, how could you possibly determine that
4217440	4224640	or given empirical content of that claim? And then, but the other, like there, there is something,
4225440	4230800	and I hear that the, the, maybe I'll call, I'll be poetic, the whisper of the mystic in the,
4230800	4236400	in this drive to unify the very, very bottom with the very, very top, the cosmos,
4236400	4241280	relativity with quantum. And it's like, you know, if there was ever a falsification of
4241280	4245120	popper, there's a falsification. We've had the best minds and the best technique, and they keep
4245120	4249520	making this hypothesis and it keeps getting reliably disconfirmed and they, that doesn't matter.
4249520	4256400	They just keep going and they just keep going. And I think that's powerful. Yeah. I wouldn't
4256400	4263520	want to. I, I'm very, I, I try to make a distinction between the wisdom that mysticism
4263520	4270080	can give us and any particular ontological or epistemological knowledge claims that are made.
4270720	4275600	And the first, I think, I take very seriously the second, I, I agree with quite a bit of
4275600	4283840	suspicion. Right. And, and, and I think that's important. Well, I just want to, I want to wrap
4283840	4291520	up for today. And we're, we're, I think this was great. We're really unpacking things really nicely,
4291520	4295600	very dialogically, the way I like, I want to talk to you next time, just to forewarn.
4295600	4301840	I want to talk to you around, about these issues, about abstraction. And you mean,
4301840	4306960	you make a wonderful correction, or at least amendment cameras at the end of chapter one
4306960	4311680	or chapter two, you talk about, well, you say, actually, we mean more or less abstract or more
4311680	4315680	or less concrete, because the terms are actually relative and comparative, right? You know,
4316240	4320400	the dog is more abstract than the cocker spaniel, but the mammals more abstract than the dog and,
4320400	4324000	right, and all that sort of thing. And I want to unpack that a little bit more.
4325440	4330160	And how does that plug into this notion of more, more real, as you're more closer to the
4330160	4334240	inexhaustible fount of intelligibility. And then there's this other one about,
4334240	4338080	you know, direct experience, immediate pure experience. And, you know, and then you're
4338080	4342400	familiar with this, no doubt. These are criticisms made by others against people like Nishida and
4342400	4348240	the Kyoto schools, you know, and hey, Gillians would make this argument. What? What do you mean?
4348240	4354000	There's no, there's all experience is mediated. That's the gain from the Kantian Revolution.
4354000	4357600	That's the thing you're doing where you're trying to go back before it can't, you're giving up the
4357600	4362480	realization that everything is mediated in some fashion. And there's no such thing as immediate
4362480	4367200	experience or direct experience. Right. Does that sound like a fecundary to go into it?
4367280	4371360	Yeah, definitely. I mean, immediate, immediate is like abstract concrete. It's, you know,
4371360	4376560	there's, yeah, yeah, exactly. There's a contextual issue there as to what,
4377520	4380800	what immediate versus immediate means just as there is for abstract concrete. But yeah,
4380800	4385120	no, those are all important things to talk about. Definitely. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Excellent.
4385120	4391280	Well, Evan, first of all, I'm going to thank you. This has been just fantastic. Thanks.
4391280	4396080	I had great expectations and it exceeded them. I really enjoyed myself a lot. I hope you did.
4396080	4402000	Yeah, definitely. Lots of fun. And I definitely want you back. Let's have the next one just be you
4402000	4406320	and I again. Okay. And then maybe we, you could reach out to your co-authors and we could set up
4406320	4412080	maybe a third and fourth with all of us together. Yeah. We might need a little bit more time for
4412080	4418160	those episodes just to give more space for more people to be able to chime in. But I always like
4418160	4422320	to give my, you know this from when you were on the philosophy of meditation, we'd like to give
4422960	4426640	the people here the last word. It can be provocative. It can be summative. It can be
4427280	4432960	mysteriously evocative. Whatever you want it to be. I don't know if I have a, if I have a last word
4432960	4437840	of that, of that nature, other than just to say it's always lots of fun to talk with you. And,
4439200	4442000	and yeah, you know, I've really enjoyed the conversation. Yeah.
4443280	4447120	All right. So then I'll give the last word. I'm going to plug the book again. Okay. Really.
4447360	4453680	This book, if you are interested in the meeting crisis, if you're interested in, well,
4453680	4458400	relevance realization, that's in the book too. If you're interested in all of these issues,
4458400	4464000	we'll be talking about the sacred, about, you know, the fact that somehow we need to be put back
4464000	4468720	into the scientific worldview, but that means changing what we mean by a scientific worldview.
4469360	4472480	And you should be interested if you're watching this video, because I've been talking about those
4472480	4477600	things for five years, at least in this space, and I don't know, 20 years at the university. So
4479120	4485200	you should definitely buy the book. Again, very clearly written, accessible without being a dumbing
4485200	4489520	down. It's a nice stepping down without being a dumbing down. I highly recommend the book.
4489520	4494240	Go out and get it. It's not expensive. It's a great read. And thank you very much again, Evan.
4494240	4496240	Just great pleasure. Thank you.
