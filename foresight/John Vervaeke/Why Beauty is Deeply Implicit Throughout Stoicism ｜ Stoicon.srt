00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,040
Thank you, Catherine. That was probably the best introduction I've ever received.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,960
I assure you, I'm very happy to be here and I'm very engaged with the material I'll be

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,920
presenting to you. Okay, so let's start. Why is, why beauty is deeply implicit in stoicism,

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,960
especially in its commitment to rationality and virtue? So, Han, in his book, Saving Beauty,

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
laments that we have reduced the beautiful to the smooth. This is what he calls it.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,560
This is the pleasantly, easily accessible and useful. So, the way my phone is smooth. The way

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:08,800
many things are now smooth. And this is convergent with his work in another book, Agony, the Agony

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,360
of Eros, about how intimacy with mystery, which used to be in our erotic relationship,

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,880
and this intimacy with mystery, which demands transformation and commitment from us,

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,680
has been replaced by pornography that gives priority to easy access and use for pleasure.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,280
So, this is the idea of the reduction of the beautiful as something that was initially

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:47,360
very transformative and very demanding upon us to something that in fact puts very little demand

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,760
on us whatsoever. Now, he's no doubt correct how this reflects a consumerist greed in our culture

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,000
and a culture oriented to quick and easy gratification, to bottom line mentality, etc.

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,480
And his argument, of course, is convergent with the argument of other people, just one among

20
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,880
many examples, arguments from current musicologists about the loss of complex melody in popular music

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,840
in favor of super salient, please remember that notion, super salient beat and repetition. So,

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,400
again, we have easy access and of course, easy access makes sense when we are doing mass marketing

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,520
within a mass society. I think all of this is completely coherent argument. However, I believe

24
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,040
that there is something more going on in this reduction of beauty to ease of access to pleasure

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,760
and use. I think something else is going on. I propose that there is a deep suspicion about

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,120
appearance in our culture. There is a suspicion that appearances are misleading, distorting,

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,840
distracting, untrustworthy, and often being used for manipulation nefarious manipulation.

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,680
In my work with Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic in 2019 in a book entitled Zombies

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,600
in Western Culture, A 21st Century Crisis, in which we explained the emergence of the zombie

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,640
mythology as a way of articulating the meaning crisis, we noted the upsurge in the increasing

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,200
prevalence and power of bullshit. People are convinced there's more and more bullshit,

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,960
and it is more and more powerful in our society. Now, the notion of bullshit I'm using, I'm not

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:42,800
trying to be vulgar. I'm making explicit use of Frankfurt's technical arguments about bullshit in

34
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,480
his seminal essay on bullshit. So, Frankfurt distinguishes the liar from the bullshit artist.

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,400
The liar tries to manipulate your behavior by depending on your concern for the truth

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,920
and getting you to believe something to be true that is not true. That is the liar. The liar is

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,560
depending on your caring commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist, on the other hand, is trying

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,840
to get you indifferent to whether or not some claim is true and rather to be caught up in the salience

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,880
of the claim. So, prototypical examples of this, of course, are an advertising in which,

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,480
you know, you see the commercial and there's a beautiful person

41
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,600
in a bar and they're surrounded by other beautiful people. And notice my invocation of that. We'll

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,440
come back to that. And there's an alcohol present and they're all very happy and very healthy.

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
And you know this isn't true. You know that this is not what you're going to see if you go into a

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,240
bar. This isn't what you know this is not going to happen to you when you start drinking the alcohol.

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,960
And they know that you know that none of this is true. And this is the important point. It doesn't

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,720
matter because it puts you into a state where you don't care whether or not it's true and you just

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,840
find the stimulus of the alcohol super salient. And therefore, you are much more likely to buy

48
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,520
the alcohol, which of course is why so much money is poured into advertising. So, advertising is

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,000
prototypical bullshit. It works by getting you to not care about the truth at least some of the time

50
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:26,000
and who instead be caught up in the salience of what is being presented to you. Now, what's

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
interesting about this is the deep connection between bullshitting and self deception and how

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,640
they mutually reinforce each other. You see, although we use the metaphor, you cannot really

53
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,320
lie to yourself. You cannot say to yourself, I believe X, but I want to believe Y because

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,840
belief is not a direct voluntary action. Belief is not something you do. Pick a belief you'd like

55
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,240
to have that everybody loves you. Okay, do it. Believe it. Go. There's nothing to be done. You

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
can imagine it. You can hope for it. You can desire it. You can't believe it. That's not how

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,680
belief works, but you can bullshit yourself because salience is actually affected by your

58
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,800
attention. If I say your left big toe, it is now a salient to you. And of course, when things are

59
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,680
salient, now they will tend to attract your attention in the future. And so by paying attention to

60
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
things, you make them more salient, which is more likely to grab your attention. And so you get a

61
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,000
self reinforcing cycle until you are drawn into particular patterns of behavior. So self deception

62
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,880
drives, sorry, bullshit drives self deception. But of course, the more self deceived we are,

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,920
the more easy it is to bullshit us because the more easy it is to get us to be unconcerned

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,120
with the truth, because that of course is one of the deleterious functions of falling prey to

65
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,200
self deception, we get disconnected from a proper pursuit of the truth. So we got this culture and

66
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,520
with self deception and bullshit are reinforcing each other and becoming more prevalent. Now,

67
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Paul record has argued or talked about what he calls a hermetic of suspicion. And this was given to

68
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:10,800
us by Freud and Nietzsche and Marx as prototypical thinkers of this ilk. And for all of these

69
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,320
thinkers, we are they give us arguments to the effect that appearances mask self deception,

70
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:25,120
they mask a hidden motive, a secret agenda, or a deceptive covert manipulation.

71
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,600
That's why it's a hermetic suspicion, we're suspicious of how things are appearing to us.

72
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,720
However, I would argue that it goes back to the combination of the Copernican revolution

73
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,960
and the Protestant Reformation. So before the Copernican revolution, we have the Aristotelian

74
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,600
notion of realness. And it's basically tested through three, through rule through three rules,

75
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:01,920
right? And it's is my organ functioning properly? Is the medium clear? Do other people after

76
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,720
reflective discussion agree with me? Now, we still live by this, by the way, we still use this to

77
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,560
determine if what we're seeing is real. Now, this is at the hallmark core of the Aristotelian framework,

78
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,280
but notice what happens with Copernicus, we all have well functioning eyesight. It's a clear day.

79
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,280
We see the sun rise in the east, pass overhead, and set in the west. We all talk, we all agree

80
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,720
that that's what we saw. And we're all wrong. We have to remember how terrifying that is.

81
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,080
We've gotten so used to it, we, and that it has, it is so inseminated itself into us at an almost

82
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,400
unconscious level. But it expresses itself in a deep suspicion. Because if that's, if that,

83
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,720
if that can fail the test, what else is failing the test? What else is passing all of our intuitive

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,920
judgments about what is real? And nevertheless, turn out to be illusions. The Protestant Reformation,

85
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,200
of course, taught us that we cannot trust traditional institutions. We cannot trust their

86
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,840
sense of right and wrong. We are thrown back upon, ultimately, individual conscience. Now,

87
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,800
that may not have been Luther's original intent, but that's not relevant to my argument right now.

88
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,280
What we end up with is we get the isolated individual trapped behind

89
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,600
sense experience, where that sense experience is understood as the veil of appearance. I was taught

90
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,920
this repeatedly in my undergrad in philosophy as a central issue with which we had to contend,

91
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:49,440
the veil of appearance, and an ongoing anxiety about skepticism and solipsism at the heart of

92
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:56,640
what we were trying to do. And of course, the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation

93
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,960
and this concern with skepticism and solipsism come to a particular fruition in Kant and the

94
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,440
tremendous impact, and he called it his Copernican Revolution, he had on the intellectual

95
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
and spiritual development of what we now call, probably inaccurately, the West.

96
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,400
In all of this, appearances became unmoored from reality and from social structure.

97
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:32,000
But of course, they are still, nevertheless, salient and compelling.

98
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,120
That is part of our inevitable embodied experience. So notice what we have here,

99
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,440
we have appearances that are unmoored from reality and social structure. We are deeply

100
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,520
suspicious of them, yet we find them still salient and compelling. This is super bullshit.

101
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:02,480
The culture as a whole is in a place where the appearances are disconnected from realness,

102
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,760
yet they are still compelling and driving our behavior.

103
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,640
Now in order to protect ourselves, I propose or I'm arguing, from this we seek to tame and control

104
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,800
appearances and make ourselves invulnerable to them being used to manipulate us. This is

105
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,000
the great question, of course, it has been put on methamphetamines by the advent of social media.

106
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,760
How would we tame appearances, make them easily accessible back to the smooth

107
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,360
and and make it so they do not claim or intend to claim or pretend to claim to

108
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,760
pretend a deeper reality. They are superficial and they glory in being superficial, the smooth.

109
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,320
How do we seek to control them? Instead of being controlled by these appearances,

110
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,480
they will be completely manipulated by us. They will be completely in control of us.

111
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:16,960
They are solely for our use, back to the smooth. Of course, and this was what reflection and research

112
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,520
show, this is ultimate bullshit in our attempt to not fall prey to bullshit.

113
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,320
We actually fall deeper in it because this strategy of the smooth, the smoothing of appearances

114
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:41,200
distracts us from the fact that the reduction of beauty to the smooth is precisely in service

115
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:48,880
of mass marketing manipulation, as we all wear our logos that look the same,

116
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,080
saying how individual and unique we really are. So we have super bullshit being responded to

117
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:07,040
by ultimate bullshit. This, of course, is a very difficult and problematic situation.

118
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,080
What this argument is intended to show is that the reduction of beauty carries with it

119
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,240
considerable epistemological and ethical loss and risk.

120
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:30,800
But we're not trapped in the hermeneutics of suspicion. This is a point developed by Marlowe

121
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,160
Ponty extensively through his writings, but it ultimately goes back to a deep discussion

122
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:48,240
by Plato that appears in many of his dialogues. But I'll use Marlowe Ponty's presentation of

123
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:58,400
it because it is clear and accessible. Illusion is a comparative concept. It's like tall or small.

124
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,040
It's dependent on the experience, the realization of reality. I can only say this is an illusion

125
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,720
if I can say because it is not this which is real. It is a contrastive comparison. In fact,

126
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,240
technically it makes no sense to say all is illusion. That's like saying everything is tall.

127
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,480
It doesn't make any sense. Typically what people mean is all of sense experience is

128
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,520
illusion in comparison to some X that is taken to be the reality. But there's always a comparison.

129
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,920
So illusion is when appearances mislead us away from reality and they are dependent.

130
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,960
Illusions are dependent upon when appearances lead to reality within acts of realization.

131
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,120
And I want you to hear both meanings of that word coming into an intelligible understanding

132
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
and awareness and becoming real, disclosed as real.

133
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,520
Now this is one of Plato's central proposals given this realization.

134
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Beauty is when appearances disclose reality. That is beauty proper. We can realize in both

135
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:29,280
senses of the word, the world through beauty. Because beauty is when appearances lead to

136
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:39,040
reality and lead us to reality. And they have to be primary. They have to be more real than illusions.

137
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:50,000
Now note here, this requires us giving up a lot of the subjectivist and smooth notion of beauty

138
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,840
that we have been given in a post-continent mass marketing world. Beauty does not have to be pleasant.

139
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,640
It can be striking or haunting. Platinus repeatedly makes reference to this possibility.

140
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:15,040
Rilke in some of his great poetry talks about how beauty is terror that could kill us, but deans not to.

141
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,160
But it is always a moment of insight, seeing in to things, seeing through illusion and in

142
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:37,040
to reality. And this of course is part of what Platinus conveys in his argument is about beauty

143
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:45,200
and intellectual beauty, the two ineod's. There is a moment when you realize that what appeared

144
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:54,080
as relevantly real, the moment of insight, you thought something was relevantly real

145
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,080
and then you go, aha! What was salient to me was actually misleading.

146
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,320
It was wrong and notice the normativity in here. I thought I was apprehending her as

147
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,840
angry, but she's actually, notice the language, she's actually afraid and therefore I should

148
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,760
adjust how I'm apprehending her and interacting with her.

149
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,160
Notice this realization has a normativity in it, a call to responsibility and action.

150
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,160
The aha moment carries with it a flash of salience as one sees into reality. There's a

151
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,920
lot of cognitive science around this and I won't go into it. You can look at my published work

152
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,240
and my work in my on my published videos.

153
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:57,760
Somehow one is more right. In fact, we find insights so compelling in this way. We tend to be

154
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,760
biased. We tend to judge reality in terms of whether or not they were produced in our judgments,

155
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,680
were produced in an insightful manner. When sees into reality, one is more right in both

156
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:19,920
an epistemological and an ethical sense about reality. One is correct and in right relationship.

157
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:31,440
We need to be very careful here. Beauty is in the act of realization. What may be disclosed

158
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,040
could be great evil. One of my favorite paintings, and I don't use slides so I'm not going to put

159
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,240
up a slide. I hope you've seen it. If you haven't, you could look at it later, is Picasso's Guernica,

160
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,560
which is a painting of the bombing by the fascists of a town in Spain during the Spanish Civil

161
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:58,720
War, I believe in 1937. It is in many ways a horrifying painting.

162
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,160
Now Picasso's Guernica is trying to cut through all the proper and bullshit

163
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,240
around war and bring us into a full presence of the full presence of the event.

164
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,680
Collingwood would talk about this in the work of art, how it takes us out of a categorical way

165
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:27,680
of thinking. This is one battle among, no, the actual suchness of this event coming to full presence

166
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:35,600
of its full presencing. There's a reciprocal opening. The whole of the self is involved in

167
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,720
opening up to a deeper and deeper apprehension of the reality. And there's a reciprocal opening,

168
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
which of course is an instance of Platonic anegarge.

169
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:59,120
What I'm saying is it is a beautiful disclosure of evil. But this should not be confused with saying

170
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,520
it portrays evil as beautiful. It portrays evil as evil beautifully.

171
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,560
We love the painting. We love the painting. We treat it. We don't destroy. Look,

172
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,720
it's evil before us. Destroy it. It's evil. We don't destroy the painting. We honor it. We

173
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,960
hold it sacred. I believe it's now being hung in the United Nations. It's a sacred object.

174
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,800
We love the painting. And in that, therefore, in some important way, it is beautiful. The act of

175
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:45,040
viewing it is beautiful. Not pleasing, but beautiful. Plato's second great proposal about beauty is that

176
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:54,960
beauty can not must connect us to reality in a way that helps educate us in wisdom and virtue.

177
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,240
Beauty affords self-transcendence, anegarge, as I mentioned earlier. This is echoed in the work

178
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,200
of my friend D.C. Schindler, especially in the Catholicity of Reason and Love in the Postmodern

179
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
Predicament, where he talks about the three transcendentals. And remember, they're all

180
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
convertible. They're not identical, but they all interdefine and interpenetrate each other.

181
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,760
The primacy of beauty, the centrality of goodness, and the ultimacy of truth.

182
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,840
The primacy of beauty. Beauty is how the otherwise abstract reality of the Eidos, which is often

183
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:39,920
translated as the form, the forms in Plato, first reaches into sense experience. But how? Well,

184
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:49,360
Eidos actually means the look or aspect of something. Remember that. Now, think about when I ask you,

185
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:56,240
what is a bird? Well, it's feathers. It has wings, beak, and it flies. So I'll pile a bunch of feathers

186
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,800
here, put a beak, some wings, and I'll toss them in the air. They're flying. That's a bird, right?

187
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,960
No, it's a horrific mess. Because what's missing is the structural functional organization

188
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:15,040
that makes it into a bird. It's Logos, a notion that Plotinus will use that he properly gets

189
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:23,680
from the Stoics, as Kevin Corrigan has argued, the Logos, this Eidos. But notice it's a way of

190
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,320
looking at it, but the seeing isn't visual seeing, at least primarily.

191
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,560
Because you have to understand that this structural functional organization is not

192
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,640
just the synchronic structural functional organization, it is diachronic. Look, you actually

193
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:51,760
don't ever fully see an object. You can't fully see it. And all of these different aspects,

194
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,800
all of these different looks are held together by something that is not any aspect at all,

195
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,560
but a through line, a through line that is one with, but not conceptually identical to,

196
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,320
that structural functional organization. That's what the Eidos of something is. And beauty is

197
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,120
when the Eidos is being disclosed in our awareness of something. Now, Roussin, in his

198
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,240
really important book, Bearing Witness to Epiphany, is trying to integrate phenomenology

199
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,440
and Plato back together. And he talks about the musicality of intelligibility. He talks

200
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,880
about the fact that when we're making sense of things, there's a rhythm that we need to pick up on.

201
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,880
There's a rhythm, right? There's a rhythm going through this. And there's a melody. All of the

202
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,560
different instances are like notes. They're not identical, but they all belong together.

203
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,000
And there's a harmony. There's an organizing, unifying principle to it. This is the musicality

204
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,760
of intelligibility. And intelligibility is our primary way of determining what realness is. So

205
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,320
realness and intelligibility and musicality are bound up together.

206
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:12,800
When we have an insight into the form, we're leaping into a Gestalt. Not just the

207
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,480
synchronic Gestalt that's in our mind, but the diachronic Gestalt through the musicality

208
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,080
of intelligibility, of our experience of a thing. This leaping into the Gestalt is what

209
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:40,240
Zewicki talks about in the experience of meaning. So notice what we're saying here. Stoic notions

210
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,160
of beauty are often, and I don't know her name, and I wasn't here for her earlier talk because,

211
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:52,000
as I said, I'm not feeling well. I don't know if it's Salkite or Kalkite. I apologize for any

212
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:02,080
pronunciation. Makes a good case for Stoic beauty as Sumitria. Not exactly the same as our notion,

213
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,240
current notions of symmetry, better understood as proper proportioning.

214
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,720
Another notion is Ratio, which is at the heart of our word rationality, because rationality is

215
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,040
the putting of things into proper proportion, properly proportioning our attention and care.

216
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:31,360
And by doing this, we cut through illusion and into reality when we properly proportion our

217
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:41,600
attention and care so that we can track the through line, follow the Eidos, then we cut through

218
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,040
any possible illusion and appearances in the musicality of intelligibility,

219
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:57,440
beautifully disclose an underlying reality. This is why Crecipius can say only the beautiful is good.

220
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:11,280
Connecting to the real rational order of reality. This is onto normativity, a term I've coined for

221
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,840
the fact that people find the really real, inherently good and they will transform their

222
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:26,160
lives, their relationships, even their identity to be in closer communion and conformity to that

223
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,960
really real. And of course, this lines up with the Stoic proposal that the universe itself

224
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:41,120
has a logos and that logos is sacred and divine. And we are to come into an ongoing,

225
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:51,760
dare I say it, musical, joyful flowing with that logos. Marcus Aurelius, of course, is aware of

226
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,640
appearances disclosing reality and their relation to beauty. He says, we should remark the grace

227
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,360
and fascination that there is even in the incidentals of nature's process when a loaf of bread,

228
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,160
for instance, is in the oven. I know there's been another talk on this crack appear in it here

229
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:13,680
and there and these flaws, though not intended in the baking, have a rightness of their own

230
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:23,040
and sharpen the appetite. The cracks, flaws, breaking in a simple notion of symmetry,

231
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,600
and their unintended breaks in the surface structure, have a rightness about them.

232
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,360
Notice that language, the rightness, I've been talking about this all the way through,

233
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,760
a rightness that sharpens the appetite. Isn't that of course what beauty does?

234
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,880
The appearance of the cracks literally opens up the surface of the bread to the depths.

235
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:55,120
And this enhances our desire to come into contact with the bread.

236
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,960
Part two, sorry, quote two. An angry look on the face is wholly against nature.

237
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,040
If it be assumed frequently, beauty begins to perish and in the end is quenched beyond

238
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,760
rekindling. Why is an angry face against nature? Because it is a face that discloses passion

239
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,840
and not the logos that is essential to our humanity. A face too often angry can lose its beauty.

240
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,520
It no longer rightly discloses the core reality of human nature.

241
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:44,960
But let's examine more closely this realization through beauty that I have been arguing for.

242
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,080
Scarry, in an important book, an amazing book, I would put it on beauty and being just,

243
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,800
talks about how the experience of beauty prepares us for seeking truth and justice.

244
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:10,000
She gives an example of seeing a beautiful tree and she goes through the phenomenology very carefully

245
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,640
and she says, the inside is something like, I didn't realize trees could be like that.

246
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,480
Now, I'm going to do something, if you'll allow me to use a self-referential adjective,

247
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,760
verbakian about this. I'm going to put this into cognitive terms of sense making.

248
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,560
So, I didn't realize trees could be that. So, we have all of our previous experiences of trees,

249
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,280
all the different instances, all the categories and they're converging on this new entity.

250
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,280
And it somehow is disclosing the Eidos, the underlying reality of what trees really are.

251
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,200
I didn't realize trees could be like it's realized. And what that does is that opens up

252
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,200
possibilities for us, new ways of seeing and relating to trees in the future. So,

253
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,720
notice these movements. You've got a convergence to a realization of form of Eidos that is,

254
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:17,920
right, can be used in many different, it can find and formulate and reformulate problems

255
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,760
as we encounter trees in the future. Now, if you take a look at the work on

256
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,000
making sense and explanation, there's a couple things that come and the work on plausibility,

257
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,720
a couple things come out. This notion of convergence, we like convergence of independent things.

258
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:49,520
Or why? Well, if my realization comes through just one, let's do sense experience,

259
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,400
comes through just one sense channel, I see something, but I can't touch it or hear it

260
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,080
or feel it. It might not be real, it might just be a subjective illusion.

261
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,920
But if I can see it, touch it, hear it. In fact, the more senses I can get,

262
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,680
the more I'm convinced it's real. Why? Now, this is not an algorithm, it can go wrong,

263
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:20,320
but why? Because the more convergence I have, the less likely it is, the less probable it is

264
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,400
that my realization has been produced by subjective illusion or bias. So,

265
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,760
convergence gives us what Rescher, in his 1976 book, plausible reasoning, calls

266
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,200
trustworthiness. The opposite of bullshit gives us trustworthiness.

267
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,400
Of course, we know why we want IDOS, we've already talked about that.

268
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,280
What is it when a realization can suddenly be applied to what were previously many disparate

269
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,880
domains? This is making use of the philosopher of science, Kicher, some of his work on stringency,

270
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,280
but I will argue, in fact, I'll just have to claim I've got arguments elsewhere. This is what we

271
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:09,120
mean when we say a scientific claim is elegant. I've had an insight that can go to many otherwise

272
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,640
diverse. Four sequels mass times acceleration can be used to talk about planets, balloons,

273
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:27,200
blue whales, accelerating cars. Wow, that's elegant. Ben Milgram in his astonishing book on

274
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,760
practical induction, how we acquire new desires, not new beliefs, but new desires, argues for a

275
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:41,440
balance between our backward and forward commitments. What does that mean? If I'm going to promise a lot

276
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:50,880
of elegant problem solving going forward, I need to have a lot of convergence to my realization

277
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:58,000
or claim. If I have a lot of promise without much convergence, I get the conspiracy theory,

278
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,440
the far-fetched claim. If you only believe that the British royalty are lizard people,

279
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,440
look at everything that I can explain. What's the opposite? We have lots of trustworthy

280
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,440
convergence, but no elegance, no power. That's triviality. Trivialities are not false.

281
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,160
They are not worthy of your attention. So notice what we have in plausibility,

282
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,280
in good sense-making. Notice all the aesthetic terms, terms deeply associated with beauty.

283
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,840
We have convergence, a coming into oneness. We have the emergence or the emanation of

284
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,480
idos or form. We have elegance and we have balance between them.

285
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,440
Plausibility is the beauty of good sense-making, and we are deeply attracted and moved by it.

286
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,400
Now plausibility isn't probability and it isn't certainty. Plausibility is what you should take

287
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,320
seriously. What is a good proposal, where you should look for the truth?

288
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:15,600
Turning it around, beauty is sensory motor, plausibility that can be taken up into cognitive

289
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,440
plausible, therefore beautiful sense-making.

290
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,840
So, plausibility, what you should take seriously, what you should care about,

291
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,080
the reasonable promise that salience is tracking reality, the opposite of bullshit. And of course,

292
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,000
Socrates famously argued for a rationality of care. He knew ta erotica. He knew what to care

293
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,160
about. He knew what he didn't need. He knew what mattered. The unexamined life is not worth living.

294
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,760
And of course, this lines up with other more recent work by Frankfurt,

295
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,600
the importance of what we care about and reasons for love. And my extensive, sorry,

296
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:03,120
I don't mean to be self-promotional. I just want to indicate trustworthiness, work on relevance

297
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,960
realization. You are different from computers because computers don't care about the information

298
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,360
they process. You care about some information rather than other information and therefore you

299
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,560
take care of it because this is all part of you taking care of yourself and other people.

300
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,800
Lipton makes a very strong case in his book on inference to the best explanation for

301
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,600
the primacy, the primacy of plausibility. What do I mean by that? Well, think about an experiment.

302
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
I have to come up with a hypothesis. Do I generate all possible, logically possible

303
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,840
hypotheses? No, that is combinatorially vast. I pick ones that are plausible.

304
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,600
When I'm designing my experiment, I have to worry about confounds, possible alternative

305
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:01,600
explanations. All the logically possible alternative explanations? No, that is uncountably large,

306
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,840
only plausible alternative explanations. What implications do I draw from my data?

307
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:15,040
All logically possible implications? No, those that are plausible. Plausibility is primary.

308
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,280
It is before, during, and after all scientific investigation and labor.

309
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,960
Rationality depends on the orienting beauty of plausibility. Plausibility is good sense making,

310
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,160
grasping the significance of information well, grasping the, the significant of information

311
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,560
well, caring about the information in the right way. And that's what we actually mean by understanding.

312
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Look, knowledge is about evidence. Understanding is about the relevance and significance about what

313
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,040
you know. Plausibility and understanding are mutually defining. Here's the connection. Good

314
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,040
sense making is the beauty of plausibility. That produces understanding. That gives us the

315
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,000
musicality of intelligibility, which of course affords good sense making. That is the cycle

316
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,280
that we are constantly running through. It's all a cycle of beauty.

317
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Marcus Aurelius, dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars and see yourself running with them.

318
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,800
Dwell. This language is not the language of just belief. It is to be with

319
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,640
and to run with. This is participating in the beauty in the very way in which you are

320
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:55,520
contemplating the highest or deepest realities. Beauty is primary because it reaches into our

321
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:04,720
sense life and our sense making and prepares us for truth and affords us seeking it.

322
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,080
In this way, beauty, and I've already alluded to this, beauty is anti-bullshit.

323
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,360
Beauty helps us discern through bullshit and tutor us how to care well.

324
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
What to take seriously? What matters?

325
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,880
McGee and Barber in 1999, this ability to see through illusion into what's real is the hallmark

326
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,120
of wisdom. This was taken up in the consensus paper that I was a co-author on with many other

327
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,320
people led by Igor Grossman in 2020. The science of wisdom in a polarized world, no one's an

328
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,000
unknown. This ability to see through illusion into reality is central to wisdom.

329
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:01,680
I propose to you that virtue requires discernment knowing what to take seriously and what to care

330
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,640
about with insight and deep understanding. And when we have that, we have wisdom.

331
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:17,520
In the symposium, Plato proposes that virtue is a higher order of beauty. We first notice the

332
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,760
beauty of the beautiful person, then we moved to beautiful institutions, then to the beauty of

333
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:33,840
virtue. How is virtue beautiful? Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.

334
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,800
There are multiple competing interpretations of the Socratic

335
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,680
proposal of the unity of the virtues, but I take this one to be the most plausible.

336
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,520
Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.

337
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,040
It is like to be wise in this situation is to be courageous, to be wise in this situation is to

338
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:04,880
be compassionate. The virtue is a proper proportioning, a ratio of attention and care,

339
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
the rationality of attention and care, so that one homes in on what is most

340
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,040
relevantly real in that situation. Think about the stoic emphasis on posage and prochiron.

341
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,400
It's all about tailoring us so we can do this, tutoring us and tailoring us.

342
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:31,920
Each virtue is how wisdom proportionally and properly therefore appears in a particular

343
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:42,160
context. Virtue is the beautiful appearance of wisdom. Virtue is how wisdom proportionally

344
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:49,440
appears in a particular context to best disclose the most relevant truth in that situation

345
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,840
and how action is appropriate to it. Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.

346
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,000
Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.

347
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:15,280
Think about all of the stoic practices, premeditatio, what Hado calls objective seeing,

348
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,120
the view from above. What are they all designed to do? They're all designed to get you to pay

349
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:30,080
attention to how the alteration of how you're finding things salient can be

350
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:39,120
more properly attuned to the underlying reality and that often we are confused

351
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,680
because we fuse inappropriate caring with the underlying reality.

352
00:41:50,160 --> 00:42:01,840
But we can learn to have what we find salient, what we take seriously, properly tutored

353
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,560
so that salience tracks us into what is real, not just in our thoughts but in our whole

354
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:15,440
sensibility, our whole sense making, our whole comportment, our whole existential orientation

355
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,680
and stance towards reality. This of course is the cultivation of virtue and wisdom.

356
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,040
All of these practices, they may disclose things that are very unpleasant, the premeditatio,

357
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,400
doesn't disclose something, oh death, the fatality of all things. I could lose my loved one tonight.

358
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:48,000
It's not a pleasant experience. But what does it do? Well, some research on this shows is that

359
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
when you do something like this, it releases people from mortality salience. If you just trigger

360
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
people about their mortality, they will get very close-minded, very rigid, very defensive

361
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,120
of their worldview. But if you move it into a reflective practice in which you imagine that

362
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:18,880
you're dying and all the people are around you and then you ask yourself what really matters here

363
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,080
in this most real of real moments and people don't say their possessions or their power,

364
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,240
they say their relationship and because the people they care about are there,

365
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,680
they become open and flexible and loving. This is a beautiful practice even though what is

366
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,720
disclosed is not something that we like or prefer or find smooth. In fact, we are doing our damndest

367
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,880
in our culture to try and smooth over the reality of fatality, the fact that at any moment reality

368
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,320
can smash in to your most narratively cherished projects and our ultimate mortality. We try

369
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:06,240
our best bullshit around this. But the historic practices can open us up.

370
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:18,960
They can be beautiful practices that lead us into a deeper ability to be connected to reality.

371
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,840
What would that be? A connection to reality that has rational apprehension, plausible sense-making,

372
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,720
and by the way, you see here that rationality does not reduce to Cartesian logic. I'm talking

373
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,400
more about overcoming self-deception appropriately, proportioning your attention and care to the world.

374
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,520
What would that be? That sense of connectedness to reality that is fundamentally good,

375
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:55,120
that is not pleasant or pleasurable. That, I put it to you, and I think LaVine is right about this,

376
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,760
or LaVine, that is joy, something the Stoics actually talk very frequently about. And of

377
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,480
course, we've reduced it. Think about what we've done even to the word enjoyment. We've reduced it

378
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:17,040
to a synonym for experiencing pleasure. But moments of great joy can be very unpleasant.

379
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,560
They can be beyond pleasure. They can be other than pleasure.

380
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,440
One way in which we can get a notion of joy is some of the current work I do, which is the flow

381
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,320
experience that has been talked about by Chick-Sent-Mahai. The flow experience is when you're

382
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,760
doing jazz or martial arts or rock climbing, you get this tremendous narrative nanny,

383
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,600
super ego thing in your head. How am I doing? What do people think of me? How's my hair?

384
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,280
Was my shirt okay? How am I doing? What's my status now? Am I safe? Is there anything interesting

385
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,320
for me? What am I getting out of it? All of that falls silent because you are so deeply connected,

386
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,680
and there's a there's a reciprocal opening, an anagogy. The world is super salient to you,

387
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,360
and you are committing more and more of yourself to it, but you're not being bullshit,

388
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:18,160
exactly the opposite. You're being led into an intimate causal efficacy and connectedness to

389
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:28,480
the world because error really matters in the flow state. You're at one. Although you may be

390
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,760
exerting tremendous metabolic energy, you feel graceful. It feels magical. People seek out this

391
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,840
experience. They will reliably tell you it is not. It is not pleasure. Think about rock climbing. It

392
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:51,040
is absurd. You climb up this rock surface. You're hurting yourself. You're putting yourself at risk

393
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,480
of injury. You're exhausting yourself only once you get to the top to come back down. It sounds

394
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,440
like a Greek mythological torture in Hades. People do it because it gets them into the flow

395
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,440
state. They have, I've argued with Leo Ferraro and Anna Herrabenet that what's happening is an ongoing

396
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,160
insight cascade. Like you're constantly getting more and more insight into what's going on,

397
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,960
and it's calling deeper and deeper into you. You're getting this anagogic at one minute. It's a

398
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,760
deep state of joy. It is not pleasure, and it can be very painful in a lot of ways what you're

399
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:35,040
doing in that state. Sparring is painful. Rock climbing is painful. And yet people do this.

400
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,240
It is an optimal experience. It is the best experiences. Many people say it's the best

401
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:45,040
experience they have, and it is where they are at their best. And it is a universal. You find it

402
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:53,200
across cultures, linguistic groups, socioeconomic status, gender identification, continental

403
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,160
dwelling, etc. People describe this experience in similarity at the level of detail. This is a

404
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:09,360
universal. It discloses something essential about our functionality. We are made for joy, which is

405
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:17,920
not pleasure. We are made for this deep one minute, and it is a profound experience for us

406
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:26,560
because it gives us an intimate, deep connection to our reality that is disclosing itself as

407
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:33,440
overwhelmingly beautiful. There's an ongoing sense of super salience, but not deception,

408
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,880
a super salience that is making us love what is happening, falling in love with us. There's

409
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,760
ongoing disclosure and discovery, and we're tapping into the inexhaustible intelligibility

410
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,920
of reality. Seneca, even when painted into a corner, it is possible to leap into the sky.

411
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,520
The disciplining of attention and caring, cutting through self-deception in rational

412
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:13,040
virtuous realization, potentially putting us into a profound flow with nature, another stoic theme,

413
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:24,000
is a deep enactment of beauty. That is how beauty is implicit in all of stoicism.

414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,560
Thank you very much for your time and attention.

415
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:35,520
Ah, John, thank you so much. Everyone, a round of applause in the chat for John Rovegi.

416
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,960
John's going to linger with us for a while, but I'm also aware, John, that you're not feeling

417
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,360
your best, so we'll maybe take a couple of questions and see how we go. Are you okay with that?

418
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,400
Yeah, let's say 15-20 minutes. I think I've got enough cortisol in adrenaline

419
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,840
and enough flow that I can hang on for a bit longer.

420
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:05,920
I want to say, wow, John, that was elegant. You mentioned that, wow, elegance. That

421
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:13,200
exclamation of, wow, is that an exclamation of awe and is awe the experience that might be a sign

422
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,480
of beauty, plausibility, et cetera? How do we feel that? How do we recognize that?

423
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:29,120
So, awe is tricky. I think wonder and wonder flow are definitely experiences of plausibility

424
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:35,360
and intelligibility. Awe's a little bit different. We thought it would just be

425
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,600
that sort of just more, but we're running some experiments to show

426
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,920
if awe was just that, like what's happening in the flow state, you would expect people to

427
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,760
demonstrate very increased measures of cognitive flexibility after you induce the awe state in

428
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,760
them, and we're not finding that. Now, one of two things might be the case. Awe is really ephemeral,

429
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:04,400
and that's a real possibility, so take that seriously. Secondly, even if the awe state is

430
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,280
persisting long enough that it should be impacting cognition, and this second proposal is my

431
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,880
favorite because for the completely biased reason that it lines up with my argument,

432
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,400
there's probably an intervening thing that is needed. What awe does is it's one of the few

433
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:29,360
positive experiences of the shrinking of the self, and if that launches you into the training of

434
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:38,640
epistemic humility of reverence, then that would probably predict many of the traditional predictions

435
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,160
of how awe improves people. So, this is very much an experimental work and a theoretical

436
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,840
debate work in progress, so that's the best answer I could give you right now.

437
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:56,320
I think, did you say with the Marcus Aurelius quote, it's not to dwell on or dwell with beauty,

438
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:03,680
the stars? Dwell on the beauty of that. That's the translation I have. So, is that an intellectual

439
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,960
relationship? Is there an embodied relationship? I think the Stoics, and I mean, I'm going to

440
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,240
speak anachronistically, I'm going to use some of my language for them. I think the Stoics are

441
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,960
very concerned with perspectival and participatory knowing. They are not just concerned with

442
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,040
propositional knowing, and this comes out, of course, in their continual refrain that

443
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,280
philosophical discourse is not the same thing as the proper love of wisdom, because love involves

444
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,520
what you care about, what you find salient, how you're noticing and oriented in the world,

445
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,840
and how you are committing and binding your identity to something. And I think the welling

446
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:42,400
therefore should be understood as pointing towards that perspectival and participatory knowing.

447
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,880
Okay, I have one more quick question from me, and I'm going to jump into the chat because we've

448
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:56,320
got some questions. Could you just clarify how to recognize triviality versus plausibility?

449
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:04,320
Sure. So, plausibility is when you have a balance between the convergence. Many different things

450
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:11,120
give converge to this realization and the elegance. There's lots of convergence to lots of elegance

451
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:18,320
and lots of instantiation of an Eidos, right? But there has to be a balance between them.

452
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,320
When you have a lot of convergence, but not much elegance,

453
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,760
then you have a triviality. Can I give an example? Buses stop at stoplights. Okay.

454
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah, you know, you've got a lot of converging evidence for that. You've probably seen it happen

455
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,880
multiple times. Many people will agree with you. Lots of independent collaboration. You don't take

456
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,640
that as a great scientific insight. Buses stop at stoplights. Yeah, and notice what you want to

457
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,920
say here. And what follows from that? What comes from that? Where's the elegance? Well,

458
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,280
there is no elegance, and that's what makes it trivial. That's why the person who spouts triviality

459
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,960
is a bore. They're not lying, but they don't say anything that has consequence for us.

460
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,080
Hmm. Okay. Well, thank you. That was really clear. All right, I'm going to jump into the chat.

461
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,720
Something that Dave Murray said, it's not a question, but it's just an experience. And

462
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,840
yeah, I'm going to start with that. So he said, met a guy just like this at a biker. This is at

463
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:29,760
the beginning when you were talking about Harry Frankfurt and Bullshit. Met a guy just like this

464
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,840
at a biker bar a couple of weeks back, slung all kinds of bullshit, wanted me to believe him.

465
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,360
He got very upset when I would not agree, haven't been able to stop thinking of that encounter since

466
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:47,200
not sure I handled it well, felt like I should have clapped along, but not to agree in felt I

467
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,760
should have clapped along, but not to agree internally. All right, so any comments for Dave

468
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,520
on that interaction? Thanks, Dave, for that. Yeah, Dave, that's, I mean, that's a really tricky

469
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,800
situation, especially if it's a stranger. And so you don't have much sense about what you can expect

470
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:11,840
from the person, you know, is there actually, you know, an implicit possibility of an escalation

471
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,400
potentially into violence or harm. And so I understand, you know, there's care to be taken

472
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:22,720
here. And there's a there's a cost benefit analysis, like, is it going to cost you much to

473
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,800
challenge this person? If, if please hear the if, if it does come to be the case that there might

474
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:35,440
be a good reason to challenge. This is where I think learning Socratic practice is really important.

475
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,760
This is what I do in a lot of work I do around dialectic and to the logos. Socrates was very

476
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:45,840
good at drawing people into the depths of their bullshit, only to have it fall apart in their

477
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,440
hands, so that they would experience a poria. Now that in itself is a dangerous thing to do. And

478
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,840
of course, we all know what they did to Socrates. But the thing is, because a poria gives you a

479
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:02,400
choice point, you can either retrench even more deeply. And that, right, that is a real possibility.

480
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:12,160
Or you can do the following, you can open up, you can experience wonder, which is to open oneself

481
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:20,080
up to call one's world and oneself into question in a beautiful way, in a wonderful way. And so

482
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:27,120
I would again, please hear all the caveats I put before it. But there are times when people are

483
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:34,400
bullshitting. Perhaps a relationship is at risk. And somebody is bullshitting. This can often happen

484
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:42,880
in couples therapy. The therapist often needs to use techniques, largely Socratic in nature,

485
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,080
to try and get the person into a place where they are willing to

486
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:56,000
disidentify from being a bullshit artist in an important way. See, the problem, as I said,

487
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,240
with bullshitting, and we all know this, the problem if you bullshit a lot is you start to

488
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,680
believe your own bullshit, you don't really believe your bullshit, you fall prey to it.

489
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,720
And so getting people to break out of that cycle, it can be very challenging. But that might be an

490
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:19,200
instance where doing, posing a Socratic challenge to bullshit might be really necessary, or at least

491
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:26,880
highly indispensable and needful at the time. Don, you said we can't believe our bullshit.

492
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:33,360
But we repeat, we say bullshit enough that it just becomes more salient and therefore.

493
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,760
Right. And then we engage in action, which causes us to have certain beliefs. So technically,

494
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,200
we don't believe our bullshit. Our bullshit leads us into being locked into what we find

495
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:51,920
salient. And then our actions are what cause our bullshit. We can't, sorry, cause our beliefs. We

496
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,920
don't, we can't act a belief. But our actions actually cause our beliefs. And so in that way,

497
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:06,960
bullshit channels our actions, and then those cause our beliefs. And Pascal, and I don't mean

498
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,840
to say he was promising bullshit, but Pascal was aware of this. When he gave Pascal's wager,

499
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,080
he didn't want, he said very clearly, I don't think it will convince you of God's existence.

500
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,320
What I noticed how this is a really sneaky plausibility argument, what it should do is

501
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,640
take, make you take seriously going into church and lighting a candle, because he knew if he

502
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,840
started to do these things, then things would become salient to you. And then the beliefs would

503
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:36,240
start to accrue, even though he could not give you any argument for them. Yeah. Yeah. And, and

504
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,800
that's what Marcus Aurelius is doing quite a bit. He's kind of always piecing through things that,

505
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,320
that veil of appearance when you said that I'm thinking of that piecing through

506
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:50,160
that veil to get to the reality of the food on our plate, the wine in the bottle, etc.

507
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,720
Let me move on to another question.

508
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,080
Mark, Mark Trumbull says, what is the relationship between beauty and confirmation bias?

509
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:09,360
So that's a very tricky one. And there's a sense in which some more empirical research is needed

510
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:19,760
at a couple of lynch points. I think confirmation bias is a kind of pornography. And in fact,

511
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,760
I think you can even talk about confirmation porn. And in that sense, it's given my argument

512
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,920
in my use of Han, it is antithetical to beauty, which should startle us and wake us up and make

513
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,480
us ask questions and prepare us for truth that we do not yet have. And so in that sense, beauty,

514
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,880
as I've argued for it here, which of course is not our everyday notion of beauty, I've taken great

515
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,760
care to do it, I did distinguish that, right? Beauty in the sense I've been arguing here would be

516
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:54,320
the opposite of confirmation bias, which is a kind of cognitive pornography. Yeah. Now,

517
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,840
you have to be careful about this because you can't, this is what I cannot tell you.

518
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:05,280
Don't ever engage in confirmation bias, because that would mean I would rob you of heuristics

519
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,960
that you need, because what these heuristics, when they're adaptive, what they do is they help you in

520
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,640
situations, ignore a lot of irrelevant information, focus in on the relevant information. The problem

521
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,200
is for every instant, and this is a formal proof that no free lunch to the theorem,

522
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,440
for every instance where that heuristic helps you, there's another instance where it equally harms

523
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:35,840
you. And so you have to get good at ameliorating this and seeing the bias or seeing the heuristic

524
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:44,000
in context. Thanks, John. I'm just noting the questions in the chat, and I see one from Stacy.

525
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:51,280
Stacy says, would you say the smoothing, and that's in quotations, the smoothing of reality

526
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,240
has created a society that generally has a disdain for or denial of the necessarily complex,

527
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:05,440
or do we have a yearning at an individual level that can supersede the superficiality created,

528
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:12,000
the superficially created smoothing? So I think the answer to the first question is yes,

529
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
and I think that's Hahn's argument, so it's more his argument than mine, that the smoothing

530
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,760
locks us into a superficial simplicity instead of a challenging elegance.

531
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:31,520
About the second point, I think, of course, no one swings free of cultural influence,

532
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,320
but we know there are individual differences, and we know that one of the things in which

533
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:43,360
there are individual differences is need for cognition. This is how much do you need to go out

534
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,920
and find problems rather than just waiting to react to problems that are given to you by

535
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,520
circumstance or other people? Do you seek out problems and challenges that have not been given

536
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,360
to you by reality or by circumstance? And by the way, need for cognition is predictive of

537
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:04,880
rationality. Your intelligence is only weakly predictive of rationality, and if you want to

538
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,320
see about that, go look at a whole bunch of other work that I've done and worked by Stanovic

539
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:14,880
and a whole bunch of other people. So many individuals have a kind of constitutional resistance

540
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:23,920
to the demification, the stupification that is happening, and what they do is they seek

541
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,240
to complexify their cognition because they have a high need for cognition. Now, that is probably,

542
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,520
in some sense, perennially true, but it is also more pertinently true right now because,

543
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,880
as I've indicated, we have the technological and social acceleration of the strategies of smoothing.

544
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,480
Yeah, thanks, Joan. People that have high need for cognition

545
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,600
and seek rationality need to seek each other out and find community and mutual support.

546
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,320
So, obvious reference to the group here. Yeah, that's what we're trying to do here.

547
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,720
I'm going to take two more questions from the chat, everyone, and one question from my co-host,

548
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:14,960
and hopefully that's going to be good, John. Leonard says, what to do in cases in which authentic

549
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,040
natural salient beauty is indeed misleading? Do you recommend specific contemplative practices

550
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,080
to recover from self-deception stemming from being blinded by beauty?

551
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,000
So, you have to be, I understand the question, and I'm not being dismissive of it.

552
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:42,160
Typically, what we mean is, let's say, for example, a woman is naturally very beautiful to

553
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,640
a heterosexual man, just as a prototypical example from literature. I'm not giving it any

554
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:56,720
moral priority at all. And we say, but that beauty was actually deceptive because she was evil,

555
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:03,040
or manipulative, or a liar, and all the horrible tropes, and I know there's sexism bound up with

556
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:10,560
this, but that has been a prototypical instance of it. Now, you have to be very careful because

557
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,040
what the natural sexual beauty discloses is actually something like, there's good reason to

558
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:24,400
believe symmetry in the modern sense of the person's appearance and healthiness of their appearance.

559
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,640
And those are both indicators of, sorry, I don't mean to sound crude, but this is sexual attraction

560
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:37,440
we're talking about. Those are both indicators of good capacity for sexual reproduction. And so,

561
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:46,720
in that sense, there was no deception. Now, what we can do is we can fall prey to the halo effect,

562
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:52,240
which is conclude that because the person is naturally attractive, that they are also morally

563
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:58,880
virtuous. Now, that thing, the halo effect, you should definitely engage in contemplative

564
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:06,080
practices to get to more reliably challenge. The halo effect is very, very dangerous. Now,

565
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,400
you can see why it evolved because halo effects, people that are attractive will largely

566
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:17,040
marshal social influence. And if they marshal social influence, you better think well of them

567
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:24,320
because social power, et cetera. So, we can understand why it's an evolutionary adaptation.

568
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:33,280
But nevertheless, if we could all learn to more successfully challenge the halo effect

569
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:42,240
and retailer our salience radar, it would do us all very well. And by the way, it helps the people

570
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,920
who live by the halo effect because eventually it goes away. And I know people like this.

571
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:57,600
And then they're really bereft. They're really bereft. I had, I noticed I was, like many of us,

572
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:02,000
I had been unsuccessful in the people that I had entered into a romantic relationship with.

573
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,680
So, this next time I decided to do something pretty stoic, I think, not to praise myself,

574
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:17,360
but I decided I'm going to challenge my default automatic attractiveness radar, what grabs my

575
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:23,920
attention in women, the type that I like, and I'm going to go off type. And so, I met somebody

576
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,360
who I'm now with, one of the best people I've met in my life. And I fell in love with her soul

577
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,160
first because of that. And then I've only come to realize, not only through my own eyes,

578
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,120
but the eyes of others, that she's actually a physically very attractive woman. And this has

579
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:50,800
been the best for me that it could possibly be. So, if we are being really careful about what

580
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:58,560
we're pressing on here, something like the halo effect, yes, yes. I think it's good to challenge

581
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:04,000
the halo effect. I don't think that's a particular problem with beauty. I think it's a

582
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,240
particular problem with our judgments about how we are leaping from, and this is inappropriate

583
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:17,840
leaping, right? There's good leaping and bad leaping, leaping from the disclosure of some

584
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:28,640
underlying reality, a kind of capacity for sexual reproduction to making conclusions about

585
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,800
people's moral character. That's where we need to pause and to challenge.

586
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,720
hugely helpful answer, John, and thank you for your question. Okay, one more question from the

587
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:47,360
chat, and then one more question after that, and we're done. So, Geon has a good little question

588
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:53,120
for you, John. Could you share methods to question myself if I am bullshitting or not?

589
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:01,120
So, the first thing to do is to adopt a practice of active open-mindedness.

590
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,800
Learn about various cognitive biases, and then first, and you'll find this very easy and pleasurable,

591
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:14,400
identify cognitive biases in other people in newspaper articles or videos or in other people,

592
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,360
and you'll be really good at it, and I want you to remember this. You'll be really good at it. We

593
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:25,120
are really good at detecting cognitive bias in other people, and then try and apply that to yourself,

594
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,960
and you'll find that's really hard and you're not very good at it. That's because the Cartesian

595
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,840
monological model of how reason works is dramatically wrong. Reason works socratically,

596
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:43,440
it works dialogically. I'm good at identifying your bias, you're good at identifying mine,

597
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:50,320
and so what we need to do is regularly engage in socratic dialogue, dialogue with each other,

598
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:57,920
and so we get more and more capable of doing that, and then eventually, you will start to more and

599
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,840
more internalize that into an internal dialogue. Remember what Antistony said, he learned to

600
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:11,200
converse with himself from Socrates, and eventually, you will internalize that ability

601
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:17,120
to take other people's perspective on your own perspective, and then you will start on your own

602
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,080
to be able to do active open-mindedness. Oh, that's brilliant, John. Again, I just want to

603
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,840
bring up Marcus Rades here. I notice that sometimes he does this little dialogic thing,

604
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,800
he asks a question and then answers it. It's thoughts to himself, right? The meditation is

605
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:39,600
a dialogical exercise, a dialogical exercise to go through. Yeah, yeah, thanks. That's a great

606
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:45,200
question, Geon. Thank you. All right, I'm going to invite my co-host, Phil Yanov, to the stage to

607
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:51,920
ask the final question, John. Over to you, Phil. All right, John, thank you for being here today.

608
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:57,360
Thank you for hanging out with us and sharing your thinking with us and letting us ask you

609
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:02,240
questions. It's just been a real gift. I'm going to tell you, I can't wait to go watch this again.

610
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:09,120
I'm glad we're recording this so I can come back and revisit this. And I'm sorry that you're feeling

611
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:15,360
poorly, but I'll make one last question, one last question. I look forward to your question,

612
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:22,160
Phil. I really enjoyed our conversation earlier. So thank you. And I did too. And so I'm going to,

613
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:29,600
you know, we've been talking about beauty and stoicism and it's, I feel it's a romantic notion

614
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,400
and you've got lots of thinking and we got to put all those pieces together. But I would love

615
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:43,440
to hear you reflect a little more upon a statement I heard you make in another interview where you

616
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:50,960
said that, you know, stoicism was kind of a gray area. And what you were saying was,

617
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:57,680
maybe it was a religion. And I was trying to get to the thought of what is your thinking in

618
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,320
was stoicism a philosophy? I mean, they see themselves as the heirs to Aristotle, right?

619
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,560
Or is it a religion or was it somewhere in the middle or were they bullshitting themselves

620
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:14,960
about what they were really doing? This is wonderful. So I mean, this is a question other

621
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,360
people have wrestled with I've looked at I haven't read it thoroughly. So I don't want to claim

622
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:25,920
competence in it. You know, entire PhD thesis around this question. And it goes around what's

623
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,880
called the demarcation problem in the social sciences about religion. We don't know what we're

624
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,440
we have by the way before we go see religion, we have the same problem with science, the demarcation

625
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,840
problem also exists for science. That's it's very hard to say that's a science and that's not.

626
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,560
So the demarcation problem for religion is well, what's a religion is going to a sports stadium

627
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,360
where you go on a specific time with a whole bunch of other people and you cheer and you yell

628
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:53,520
and you eat together and you chant and you're rooting for these people that are doing

629
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:58,080
something that in no way changes the real world. Is that a religious action?

630
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:05,120
Yes, and that's the right answer. The right answer is me. Is Buddhism a religion? Well,

631
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,920
it could be a philosophy, but it's not right. It's not a philosophy in modern academic sense

632
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:18,240
of philosophy, but it's it's a love of wisdom. Right. And so I think stoicism is I often use

633
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:26,240
the the phrase, the hyphenated phrase, it's a religious philosophy or a philosophical religion.

634
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:34,080
Because I think trying to come down hard on a demarcation, it has practices, it has rituals,

635
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:40,240
it has community, it has a sacred dimension that you are supposed to come into a participatory

636
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:47,040
relationship with that transforms you profoundly. I think this is a reason why stoicism was taken

637
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:54,960
up and becomes a proper part of Neoplatonism, which has found a home in many religious traditions.

638
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,080
Right. Of course, there's Neoplatonism within Christianity, within Islam, within Judaism.

639
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:07,120
And of course, there is there's really weird historical inter integrations between something

640
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:15,120
like Neoplatonism and Vedanta and Buddhism. And so this amazing capacity to enter into

641
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:20,400
reciprocal reconstruction with other religions and religious philosophies, it tends to

642
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,560
to make the religions more philosophically deep and tends to make the philosophies more

643
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,800
religiously transformative. And so I think, you know, I think, I think you have Aristotelian

644
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,680
science and Neoplatonism, I think you have platonic spirituality that spends that sense of

645
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:45,120
an agage that I talked about. And there's the mystical. And then stoicism, I think,

646
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:55,200
it gives you a lot of practices that I think are crucial. I'd be more happy saying that, you know,

647
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:02,400
Platonism is a religion, but I also think it is more properly described as a philosophical religion

648
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,960
or a religious philosophy. What's interesting, I wasn't looking for a definitive answer from you.

649
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:14,880
I wanted to hear your thinking on this, because I think it is exactly that demarcation problem

650
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:19,120
and part of it is too. And I've heard you comment on some other things is that, you know,

651
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,680
there is a hunger for some binding of ourselves to some other philosophical tradition,

652
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:29,520
which is the thing that you talk about a lot. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing here.

653
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,440
Yes, there is. And I think this whole, if it's not presumptuous, but I think you're at least

654
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:41,440
affording this, Phil, I think this whole conference is around the sense of religio to be deeply

655
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:46,800
connected to something that is profoundly and transformatively and beautifully real

656
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,760
that helps us find the centrality of goodness and the ultimacy of truth from the primacy of beauty

657
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:59,760
to use DC Schindler. Now, the one thing that I think is interesting, and the problem is the

658
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:07,280
history gets a little bit hard here, is, is there a place, was there a place for the mystical

659
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:13,520
experience that is clearly explicitly present in Neoplatonism? You see it in Plotinus without

660
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:20,640
question. And of course, it's controversial around whether or not the mystical that sense of, you

661
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:29,600
know, a profound at one mint with reality is actually something that Stoics report on. I don't

662
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:39,760
know. I think that part of the history is perhaps lost to us. Maybe it gets submerged under the

663
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:45,440
emerging Christianity, maybe gets submerged when it's taken into Neoplatonism. I don't know. I don't

664
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:53,440
know. I do think that flow with nature, especially if it has connections to what I talk about as flow,

665
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:59,040
I think it's on a continuum with more proper transformative and mystical experiences.

666
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,880
So do you, and I apologize, but I'm going to get one more question, one more answer out of you.

667
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:10,240
That's fine. Do you think those, you know, the, the Zeno's flow and, and I can't say the guy's name

668
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,560
Mahila. Chicks have my eyes. Yeah, check. I, you, every time you say it, I think I should record

669
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,640
that. So I can say it, but, but those two uses of flow, do you think those are similar enough

670
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:29,120
to have that conversation? Yeah, I do actually, because I mean, the, the, we tend to over focus

671
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:33,840
on prototypical instances of flow that come out in athletic performance or martial arts or rock

672
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,720
climbing, but it also comes out in jazz and it also comes out when you're doing dialectic into

673
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:45,040
the logos and practice. And we're following the logos the way Socrates says you follow the wind.

674
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:53,840
That, to my mind, is an ongoing practice of insight, improvisation, re-questioning, reopening up

675
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,920
an ongoing sense of discovery and wonder. And that seems to me to be very much a flow state.

676
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,040
Error matters. Socrates will catch you out. You have to be very clear. There's immediate feedback.

677
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,560
These are all the conditions that create flow. I think being in Socrates presence,

678
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,640
if it was taken up correctly, which is always the existential choice in the face of Socrates,

679
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:20,160
could induce a flow state in people. Don is following the wind, the same of sort of stream

680
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:25,040
of consciousness, thinking, journaling, writing, following the logos, following the wind.

681
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,600
What do you mean by following the wind? Oh, I just thought I thought, I thought you said

682
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:37,360
following the wind. No, following the logos, like, like, like, like, like a wind, right? Like a wind.

683
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,920
Yeah. It blows and it comes from another direction that we have to reorient. So

684
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,400
Socrates talks about following the logos as if we're following a wind. Yeah. And of course,

685
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,480
I just thought it just reminded me of kind of a stream of consciousness type following of our

686
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:56,880
thoughts in that way. No, I don't think see flow is typically different from associational,

687
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:05,840
like, like that associational thing, because it requires it flow really cares a lot. And there's

688
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:11,360
a lot more I could have put in my talk. We flow really cares and is afforded by a concern for

689
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:16,720
intelligibility. If things start to be not make make not make sense for you, you immediately

690
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:21,280
fall out of flow. If you start to make a lot of mistakes, you're immediately out of flow.

691
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:27,040
That's the thing that will snap you out of flow like nothing else. Yeah. All right. I think we

692
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,600
also have a t-shirt. Well, you're feeling well. I want to bring you back for more questions about

693
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,240
this particular set of things. But thank you so much for your time today. This has been

694
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:43,200
thanks, John. I think we have a t-shirt phrase. Beauty is anti bullshit. John Varvage.
