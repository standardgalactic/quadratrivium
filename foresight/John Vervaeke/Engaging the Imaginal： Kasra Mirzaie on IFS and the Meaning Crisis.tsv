0	4240	Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Reveki. I am here with Kazara Mirzai.
5520	9920	Kazara is going to be part of this ongoing discussion. We're having on this channel
9920	17520	with people who are practitioners and also researchers about IFS, Internal Family Systems
17520	24240	Theory. And I'm very excited about this. I've met Kazara offline and we've got a really interesting
24240	29360	conversation. I'm rather looking forward to this one. But Kazara, why don't you introduce yourself,
29360	35120	tell us a little bit more about your background, and then maybe we can talk about some of your work
35120	41120	and how it weaves into what we're doing here at the Reveki Foundation. And then we'll just take
41120	48400	it from there. Yes, thank you very much, John. Thanks for having me. Oh, great pleasure. Yeah,
48400	56560	so I'm a psychotherapist by training. I'm a practitioner. I'm a clinician. And I'm a researcher
56560	62880	and teacher at the university in Hildesheim in Germany. And what I focus on is like there are
62880	69120	a couple of things I focus on. So my research is on emotion regulation and developmental
69120	77280	psychopathology. So I'm looking mostly on adolescent, on the adolescent age and the age group. And
78080	86000	what I'm doing there is I look at how psychotherapy has an impact on it. So we know that
86080	93040	psychotherapy works, but we don't know why to a lot of degrees. And I have a more of a dynamical
93040	99120	systems theoretical view on it. And I look at affect dynamics and see how affecting emotion
99120	108640	fluctuate and have their ups and downs and look at those in especially teenagers. But at the same
108640	115600	time, I'm also more oriented to more global view, more theoretical view. And I'm also deeply
115600	124240	influenced by one of my doctoral supervisors, Werner Greve. He's a professor for developmental
124240	130080	psychology. And he's actually, I'm in this academic ancestral line of Balthus and Staudinger.
130800	136720	You mentioned them in the meeting process. So Werner Greve, he actually, he did his PhD under
136720	142400	Paul Balthus. So he has this lifespan, lifespan perspective on, on development. And
143280	148080	yeah, I try to bring in those aspects, but also the theoretical aspects. And he's also deeply
148080	154400	into action theory and philosophical psychology. So I also follow this, this trend to look more
154400	160400	broadly onto meaning making, I would say. And this is where IFS comes in. And as a practitioner of
160400	168960	IFS and a research, I also do research on it. Yeah, I'm deeply interested in the also in the
168960	174400	cocci of it and the cognitive science of it. And yeah, and this whole machinery of meaning
174400	182080	making. So yeah, that's where I come from. What would you like to talk about first? I mean,
182080	190160	we could pick up on a particular thread and give people, you know, a more specific example of
190160	195920	what your work looks like and how it's related to meaning and the meaning crisis, perhaps that
195920	201840	would be great. Yeah, I think, oh, that's a good question where to start. I think there are several
202640	210080	paths, paths that could, that we could take. And maybe start, I know that your audience knows
210880	216000	IFS by now, but maybe just to sum up for them. I think we could, we can always talk more about
216000	223600	it. I mean, I, yeah, the work with, with Seth, Seth Allen, Seth Allison has been
224560	233200	really, really profound. And, but I think having many voices articulate what it is could be very
233200	241600	helpful to our listeners. Yes. And I really enjoyed those videos. I also wanted to extend that and
241600	247120	tell you that I think you both have done a very wonderful job. It was, it was actually really
247200	254320	different to experience both of you. I mean, Seth does, you know, did an excellent job. He has this
254320	260240	wonderful personality. And you also show different sides and aspects of yourself, John. So I really
260240	267760	like that too. Yeah, well, thank you for saying that. And I apologize to Seth. I think when I
267760	272480	first mentioned him, I confused him with Seth Dillinger. I apologize about that. But Seth Allison,
272480	281520	yes. Yeah, he, we spoke before time and he proposed doing this. And yeah, I knew it would be
281520	291440	challenging. But I thought people needed a concrete example in order to get a deeper sense of what
291440	297680	was going on. I agree. I agree. Hey, I think sometimes we tend to be way too abstract and
297680	303440	theoretical. So we need something to ground ourselves again. So yeah, maybe to connect to that.
304400	309440	Yeah, just really, really briefly, shortly at what I, what I think or my take on IFS is that
310160	317360	it's actually a model of a living and self organizing psyche that is composed of, I would say
317360	323600	living things. And Dick Schwartz would say sub personalities or we could call them parts.
324560	331040	And yeah, those interact with each other in a certain, and again, this is my language in a
331040	339920	certain qualitative space and relationship that we would call the self. And so you see again,
339920	345520	this is my notion of it. It's actually tainted there. I don't assume a monadic self. I rather
346160	352720	assume a relational, flexible, and the self is more as a process than a product.
355200	361280	So in that sense, IFS assumes the multiplicity of the psyche or a multiplicity of the psyche.
362400	368240	And yeah, I would, I would, I would want to start maybe by linking it to the meaning crisis,
368240	374160	because I think this is so deeply important. And then we can come to my work and how
374160	380080	my perspectives from I also forgot to mention that I worked many years in psycho oncology and
380080	387680	pediatric psycho oncology. And, and I currently work at a residential adolescent residential
387680	392560	crisis center where I work like with borderline personality disorders and very, very traumatized
392560	400240	young people. And I'm so confronted with this whole absurdity and the meaning crisis that
400480	408080	you automatically you try to find ways and try to make sense out of it. So, and I see deep,
408080	414400	deep connections there. And so I would say the short answer is that IFS helps both the cognitive,
415120	421760	as well as the existential and spiritual machinery of meaning making. So that's, yeah,
421760	429600	that's very powerful. Yeah, and I think via a dialectic, it's a dialectical approach.
430640	436640	And, and I think we can add in more mythos. And I mean, not only the logos, but also the mythos.
437360	443360	And fundamentally, IFS, again, is a dialogical practice and a form, I would say a form of
443360	450000	serious play to use one of your terms or you to use your language. And the serious play,
450880	459200	it helps to systematically modify salience, in a sense. And, and, and obviously to switch and,
459200	463600	and change perspectives. So this perspective taking is very, very important. And I think
463600	470400	IFS is powerful in doing so. And it helps you forward and come into contact with your,
471280	477440	yeah, with different aspects of your, of your being and your identity. And, and, and, and, and
477440	484160	doing so get a grasp on your inner conflict in a platonic sense. And to resolve, hopefully resolve
484160	493280	those inner conflicts. That was just, wow, that was just wonderful. So let me see, I want to,
493280	498240	I want to make sure I get all these. So as you mentioned, salience and perspective taking,
498800	505040	you, you mentioned people get sort of an enrichment of their self awareness. They, they
506400	512080	discover, uncover, realize different aspects of themselves. And then
512640	519840	there's also you, you were talking a little bit. Well, let's start with those three, first of all.
521600	531120	And then we can pick up on any threads that are remaining. So I get, I, I get that it alters
531120	541120	salience. Because it gets people to pay attention to things they weren't previously paying attention
541120	546560	to within their psyche. Is that the main, that's the salience? I know I might be oversimplifying.
546560	550080	I'm just trying to get the initial idea. No, I think, I think that's, that's totally fair.
550800	556560	And, and I think there was, there was again, a machinery behind that. And I think this has deeply
556560	564480	to do with, I think, dynamical systems theory can here can help us understand what we mean also
564480	569920	by this idea of salience. So what I understand, or what I mean when I talk about salience is that,
570720	575440	and again, I would say this is deeply psychodynamic or depth psychological. That's
576480	582800	IFS is really related to that. That you're not the master in your own house. Something is driving
582800	587440	you. Right? Yeah. And that's the poconic theme you were bringing up earlier about. Yeah. Yeah.
587440	594960	Exactly. Something is driving you. So those different forces. And they have their own framing.
595600	600560	They have their own sets of glasses that they put on, right? Yeah. They see the world
600560	605440	from their perspectives, because they have their own agent arena relationship.
606400	610160	Yeah. Yeah, that's what this is what I was bringing in. And, and what I mean when I talk
610160	620480	about dynamical systems theory is that I think those forces that drive us, they, they are a system,
620560	625680	in a sense that they are a complex system, biological system. That's why I'm talking about
625680	633760	living things, which means, and living things are memory systems. And I think this is, this is an
633760	641200	aspect of dynamical systems theory that is often overlooked. But we're, it's, they are deeply,
641200	646240	so biological systems are memory systems. And this has to do with this technical notion of
646240	652800	non-urgidicity. And I don't know if we should expand on this or not, but... Well, we could.
652800	656800	I mean, it overlaps with some of the significant work Michael Levin's doing in some of the
656800	661760	conversations I've had with him. Can I, can I, can I, can I ask you a question at this point?
661760	668320	Yeah. So I get that this is wonderful. So let's at least say there are sort of autopoietic systems
668320	673120	right there. They, they're, they're seeing the world in a certain way, and they have a certain
673120	678160	function, and they're trying to maintain themselves and, and satisfy that function or functions. I
678160	684560	don't want to be simplistic. Is that okay so far? Absolutely. And then, and I like this idea of they,
684560	689200	they each have a different framing and agent arena relationship. And that means, of course,
689200	695120	they can come into conflict in some significant way. And this is the platonic model you were
695120	700000	alluding to earlier from the Republic, right? You've got this inner conflict. And then I,
700640	708720	I've been wondering about this. So I have a question to ask. So Plato posits the idea that
708720	716720	we have metadrives. We have two fundamental metadrives. One is a kind of inner justice,
716720	723600	inner peace. We, we, whatever it, however we try to satisfy our goals and our desire, sorry,
723600	728400	satisfy our desires and reach our goals. We don't want that to cause more internal conflict. We
728400	734880	want it to bring resolution to that conflict and an inner binding and an inner religio. And then we
734880	743920	have another important drive, which is we want to be most in contact with what is most real. We
743920	749840	don't want whatever is satisfying our goals or satisfying our desires to be illusory, fraudulent,
749840	755360	anything. And so the question is this, I, I'm not very happy with, you know, thinking about the
755360	761520	self as some sort of thing. And you seem to be also like that. You described it as a space. And I,
761520	766000	I'm thinking, I'm wondering if it's a functional space. What do I mean by that is maybe perhaps
766000	773200	the self is understood as that which is these two metadrives. The self is that which is driving
773200	780000	for the resolution of inner conflict and bringing us into conflict, sorry, bringing us into contact
780000	784560	with reality. What do you think about that as a proposal? That that is maybe how we could understand
784640	789200	the fundamental functionality of the self. Given that you raised the platonic model, it seems like
789200	794640	there's a way of understanding the self in terms of that platonic model. That's wonderful.
795520	801840	Can you repeat that again? That's so, that's so rich. I have to think about this again.
802720	810960	Yeah. So Plato has this proposal, right? He doesn't state it like it explicitly as a,
811840	817200	as a standalone proposition, but it very clearly comes out in many places, in many dialogues,
817200	823840	most prominently in the Republic, which is the one you were alluding to, that we, we have a desire
823840	829680	for inner peace. But this is not just, that's why he also uses the word justice. It's that,
829680	835760	Yes, it's the optimal gripping. It's the optimal gripping. It's this harmonic interplay, right?
835760	841760	Yes. Yes. And so we want, we have this, there's a, there's a meta drive to bring about that
841760	846960	harmonic interplay. So you can call it sort of this vertical optimal gripping, if I can allow
846960	854000	that. And then we also have this meta drive of horizontal optimal gripping with the world
854000	860800	and other people. And the self is those two functions. And what Plato talks about is it's
860800	866960	possible to actually coordinate the satisfaction of those two functions. And I would put it to you
866960	872640	that it sounds to me like IFS is exactly a practice for coordinating them, because you're
872640	878480	trying to get the parts in this harmonious sense so that you can get a better grip on reality
879120	884080	thereby. Wonderful. That's exactly what I'm, when I'm thinking, there's so many things there
884720	894240	that I can, I can follow up on maybe. So I absolutely think it's about meta desires,
894240	899680	because, and I, and I would bring also in the good, the true and the beautiful, especially the good.
901680	905680	Yeah, it's these two axes, right? The two are good and the beautiful are going both ways. Yes.
905680	912800	Because when you actually do parts work, and, and they, they get into this harmonic
912800	922160	self organization and self realization, is that now, at least it feels like they're committed to
922160	929120	something that they share, what parts share, and if this transcends their individual desires and
929120	934960	needs. So there are meta desires and meta needs. And I think that is to be deeply in contact with
934960	941600	reality. That's one aspect. And, and for, for this harmonic interplay to go on, because it's an
941600	948400	iterative game, right? So I, so, so the, the efficient, the resiliency is in this long term
948400	953200	efficiency. So not only for the sake of self maintenance and in an auto poetic sense. And,
953200	958960	and I think this makes it deeply human. And we should definitely talk about anthropology
958960	964800	as well. And this connects to my work in, in oncology, and also as in psychiatry,
964800	969280	because I think it's missing, we have deeply dehumanized anthropology going on. But
971280	976320	what I mean by, by, make us human is to not only to care for ourselves, but also to care for others.
977600	983840	I think that's, I think that's wonderful. So this, this, so Plato has a term, and you might
983920	990160	have heard me talk about it, the anagoge for, right? And, and, and so I, I think you're in
990160	995760	agreement, the self is kind of the anagoge function. It's these two meta desires, right,
995760	999840	coordinated together to bring about the reciprocal opening of the human being,
999840	1005120	the flourishing with the world. And I think this connection is, I think, really, really
1005760	1013360	powerful. Because I think if we, if we agree that what Plato is proposing is something that
1013360	1019520	increases our inner peace, our connectedness to a reality, affords our capacity for self-transcendence,
1019520	1024080	cultivation of wisdom, we're not talking about something that can properly be called spiritual
1025040	1032640	without having to invoke any supernaturalism. And this, I think, and as I've had discussions
1032640	1037200	with people doing IFS, many of them want to sort of bring out the fact that IFS has this sort of
1037200	1042960	spiritual dimension to it. And I think that lines up with your wanting to bring in the mythos and
1043040	1051680	the imaginal. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Wow. Thank you, John. That's, you're exactly saying what I am,
1051680	1056880	what I was thinking. Thank you for watching. This YouTube and podcast series is by the
1056880	1064080	Verveke Foundation, which in addition to supporting my work also offers courses, practices, workshops,
1064080	1068800	and other projects dedicated to responding to the meeting crisis. If you would like to support
1068800	1074160	this work, please consider joining our Patreon. You can find the link in the show notes. I want to,
1074160	1078960	I want to propose something to you. And this is really something to do with your work. And,
1078960	1083680	and I hope I get your work right. And you can now see if I get your work right. And if not,
1083680	1088400	please correct me or add or compliment to it. Yeah, we'll work, we'll work through,
1088400	1094160	we'll work through anything that comes up together as friends. I want to compare you to Kant,
1094720	1101520	okay? So I want to see where both overlap. So the way I understand your work is,
1102320	1108960	and where I see you both in agreement, so Kant and Verveke, is that you both understand that
1108960	1116320	reality ultimately cannot be framed, right? So where I see you both differ is that what
1116320	1124240	reality ultimately is. Now whereas Kant sees reality as this thing outside of our cognitive
1124240	1130080	and rational faculties that uses frames and filters to make sense out of experiences,
1130640	1135040	which leads Kant to the conclusion, right, that we cannot have this access to the thing in itself,
1135040	1141920	this thing on sich, the Númena, and that we are ultimately trapped within our mind, I would propose
1141920	1150000	John Verveke would say that although our frames prevent us of grasping the whole reality,
1150000	1156000	we can still participate in it, right? We nonetheless participate in reality via
1156000	1165440	these things like myth-making, mythos, mythopoieses, music, symbols, art, rituals, poetry, and all of
1165440	1172400	that. So I want to go on, if you just allow me, and this dance and this serious play between,
1173120	1180160	so basically the imaginal, what I wanted to say. So basically the dance and serious play between
1180160	1189120	the ultimate and the finite is a constant process of opening and closing. I would also say of homing
1189120	1195920	and adventuring, right? So getting back to your home, to your basis, but also, you know, leaving
1195920	1202400	this safe haven and also going to exploration, this meta assimilation, accommodation that you
1202400	1207600	talk about. And this leads me to following conclusion. And now let's see if you agree,
1207600	1214240	and because this brings, again, back in the idea of self. And where I see IFS overlap, but at the
1214240	1219440	same time also different, where I also have problems with it, obviously. So I would say
1220400	1226160	there is no soul beyond the body, that that's my first proposition. So there is no soul beyond the
1226160	1234560	body. So the self-organizing process of me being in the world, being in space and time, infuses
1234560	1241440	in nature, physical, right, is the soul. So the whole, the soul is that emergent thing out of the
1241440	1247520	body, the interaction of the body, but at the same time that that emanates back, right? So the
1247520	1254800	idea of emanation is important. So at this animating principle, the anima, the suke that we talk about.
1254800	1264480	And the second proposal is there is no self beyond otherness. That's what I would propose. So
1264480	1270720	meaning the self is this emergent thing out of the interactions of those parts. And again,
1270720	1276880	this is why I think dynamical systems theory is so important, also from a scientific perspective,
1276880	1281040	because it brings in this whole idea of myriology, this part's whole relationship.
1281840	1289680	Yes, yes. And one of the many. Yeah, exactly, one of many, exactly. So the self that is that which
1289680	1299200	homes otherness as spectrality, at the same time, it's the, you know, it's the parts and the otherness
1299200	1306160	that gives home to the self. So I mean, Kirkegaard has this, has this, what's the quote, the self is
1306160	1311680	a relation that relates itself to itself. So what I mean by relationship and process, and that's why
1311680	1317280	I would agree it's not a monadic thing is that the self isn't is a constant process. And I love the
1317280	1324640	idea that it's, that it's this two axis kind of thing that you mentioned, those two dimensions,
1325200	1328400	the inner conflict, the resolution of inner conflict, as well as
1329200	1334240	getting into contact with reality. Now, the third one, when I what I want to propose is that
1334880	1342160	there was no, no thing, not a thing, no thing beyond the spirit of intelligibility. So beyond,
1342160	1347360	in other words, beyond this organizing principle, the God beyond, beyond God's that you're talking
1347360	1354960	about. And so, and I think this is what, what Jung would call the anima mundi or the uns mundos,
1354960	1360560	and I think this is similar to the idea of self. So I think it's Jung is not talking about this.
1360560	1366560	I mean, there are parts we're talking about this monadic self, but I assume he, I think he assumes
1366560	1372080	something different when he talks about self, and it becomes clear when he talks about the mandala,
1372080	1378000	like this four dimensions. To me, they are similar to those four dimensions of meaning-making,
1378000	1382960	the nomological, the normative, and the narrative, as well as the connectedness. So,
1384000	1390560	yeah, not to intellectualize too much now, but what I was trying to refer to is that
1391760	1398640	in IFS, you often talk about the self as the part that is not a part. And to me, this
1398640	1404960	eludes a lot, or there sounds very similar to the God that is not a God, or the God beyond God,
1405760	1411120	the religion that is not a religion, so that it doesn't have this thinness to it.
1411920	1417520	Yeah. What do you think? Well, that was incredibly rich. Yeah. Okay. So I'll try and trace through
1417520	1425200	some of this. I think, yeah, what you said about my relationship to Kant is amazing. I take, of
1425200	1431760	course, from Kant, the idea of framing, and then that's what the relevance realization,
1431760	1437440	but unlike Kant, I don't think the mind is the author of framing. I think the mind participates
1437440	1442960	with the world in framing. So I would add that E, right? There's in framing going on,
1442960	1448880	relevance is something co-created by the world and the mind. And that's what makes me fundamentally
1448880	1454880	different from Kant and makes me a plateness, because I believe in this sense of participation.
1454880	1459680	So I think if that lands back with you well, I think we understand each other very well. You
1459680	1464800	understand me very well. I think that's true. Yes. I even think I understand why you think that
1464800	1469680	that is. And I think it's because of those bioeconomic constraints that we have. I mean,
1469680	1475920	it has to be to make, so that we can give an account of evolution as well. So we have to
1475920	1482400	participate in being in contact somehow with reality. So it wouldn't make sense with evolutionary
1482400	1491600	theory in a deep sense. And it also means that we can sidestep a lot of significant contradictions
1491600	1498240	in Kant. Kant denies, because the mind does, in his view, mind frames only in terms that are
1499200	1504960	relative to human experience. We can have no knowledge of God. But as other people pointed
1504960	1509440	out almost immediately, that same argument applies completely to the thing in itself,
1509520	1515760	which means Kant becomes a kind of Berkeley and idealist, and he resisted that. And I don't want
1515760	1526560	to get into the technicalities. But I think you very much have caught the deep gist of what I'm
1526560	1532880	saying. Thank you. That's important to me, John, because I think in this way, I understand you
1532880	1538240	better. I think if I speak your language, we can communicate better. So that's why it was
1538320	1545360	important for me to get your feedback on that. I appreciate that. Now, I want to thank you.
1548080	1551200	Sorry, this may come off as arrogant. I don't mean it to you. It's just because of my
1551200	1554960	particular education. It's usually me trying to reach the language of the person I'm talking to.
1554960	1562640	Yes, I get that. And so I really appreciate this. The idea that I think there's two
1563440	1572960	ideas. Your first two proposals about the soul, I put them together. I think they belong together
1572960	1577520	in the claim that the self is not substantial. The self is not a substance. The self is not an
1577520	1583520	independently existing thing. We give up that Aristotelian model that the self is a substance.
1583520	1589040	And I think a standard model of the soul, not all models of the soul in all versions of Christianity
1589040	1597040	by any means or in Islam or anything like that. But many central models of the soul is that it is
1597040	1604800	a substance. It is a standalone thing to which all properties and relations and actions belong.
1604800	1612080	And I think that is fundamentally misplaced. I think it is to get things exactly the wrong
1612080	1618480	way around. I think this goes to what you were saying about no-thingness and other things. I
1618480	1627440	think the relationality, the intelligibility is primary and that relata emerge out of that
1627440	1632960	relational field. And this maps very well to the bottom of our physics and the top of our physics.
1632960	1640800	And so I'm not saying anything really bizarre or weird. And I won't go into that argument,
1640800	1647760	but I am totally in agreement. And therefore, understanding the self as inherently dialogical
1647760	1654160	as self and other bound together. And I think of it as there being a deep continuity. I think
1655120	1661280	John Verweyke is a distributed cognition of the collective intelligence of parts of his brain
1661280	1670240	all the way down to sorgans and systems and cells. And I think John Verweyke is part of systems of
1670240	1674720	distributed cognition and collective intelligence that make up various cultural
1674720	1679840	environments and historical environments that he's operating in. And I think there's deep
1679840	1688640	continuity down and up. And I think that means the self is inherently non-substantial. So it's
1688640	1696000	not a thing. If by thing we mean a bounded, basiotemporal, independently existing thing.
1696800	1702960	And I think there is this deep continuity down into the depths of our body and up to the heights
1702960	1709200	of our spirit, because that's what we're actually talking about here. And in that sense, it is a
1709200	1714800	body double. And I agree with that, right? It's sort of, it's bound to the body in this and our
1714800	1725200	embodiment in a very powerful way. And then this idea that we, like the cosmos, are enmeshed in
1725200	1733920	the issue of the one in the mini, the emergence and the emanation. I think that is correct. And I
1733920	1738400	think that's a profound example of participatory knowing. It's not that we know the one in the
1738400	1744880	mini. We are the one in the mini. We know it by participating in its very principle and processes.
1744880	1750240	Of course, the content of your cognition and mine are different, but they share this same
1750240	1758000	fundamental grammar and we share it together with reality. And I think that is a deep, deeply
1758000	1762240	important thing. And so I like the final proposal. I'm coming to your final proposal and then I'll
1762240	1767600	shut up, which is there's something. Thank you. There's something in us that is like the neoplatonic
1767600	1774080	one. There is something in us that is that participates, but, but it is not a part because
1774080	1779920	it is the very principle of participation itself. And there is something in reality that is no kind
1779920	1787680	of thing. It is the very principle of thingness, right? That of things emerging, of them being
1787680	1793920	intelligible, of them entering into relationships with each other. And so I do think they're,
1793920	1799760	and Proclas talked about this. There is the one within us that participates in the one without us,
1799760	1806320	but of course they are ultimately just in some important and very hard to articulate sense one.
1806320	1814160	And so I like that proposal. I like the proposal. Turning young, young into more of a neoplatness
1814160	1819840	would be, I think, a wonderful thing to do. He's very platonic. I often call him the plate
1819840	1826800	of the psyche. His notion of archetypes is just the notion of the forms, right? And so I think all
1826800	1833040	of this deeply resonates. I hope I've done it justice in my reply to all of your proposals.
1833840	1838480	Thank you, John. That's wonderful. And especially the last part that reminded me of
1839280	1845280	we being the one that reminded me, I mean, that's such a platonic idea.
1847840	1854320	So I want to circle back to the meaning crisis with that. I'm really grateful for
1856080	1862880	you bringing back also this Persian heritage into the meaning crisis. I'm an Iranian.
1862880	1870480	I'm Persian. And so first of all, thank you for that. Well, my partner, my partner, who is
1871440	1883520	the profound beloved love of my life, is Persian. I didn't know that. Okay, that hits my heart.
1884960	1890960	She's easily one of the best people I have met in my entire life.
1893840	1895120	Yeah, I believe that.
1899120	1903600	And what you said with the one, we being the one, this reminded me
1905520	1912640	of a Persian myth by one of those Persian mystics and Sufis,
1913760	1919280	Attar. I think he's one of the teachers of Rumi, if I'm not mistaken.
1919360	1923360	The name is familiar to me. I'm learning a lot about the Sufi heritage right now.
1923360	1929040	And there is this philosophical Silk Road. Yeah, it's so interesting. And there is this
1930160	1937120	mythological being. It's called Seymour. Seymour is actually the spirit of intelligibility.
1937920	1940800	I didn't know this. Say this again. How would I spell that?
1941760	1952720	So S-I-M-O-R-G-H. Okay. The spirit of intelligibility. That's amazing.
1952720	1960640	Yes. And Attar had this idea that, I think it's the conference of the birds, I think it's called.
1961840	1965120	If I'm not mistaken. Parliament of the birds, I think I've heard of the birds ones.
1966000	1974800	There are like thousands of birds that fly to find Seymour. And they have to go through seven
1974800	1980880	valleys. And that's one is the valley of self-deception, one is the valley of detachment,
1980880	1986640	and all those things. And ultimately, what happens is that out of those thousand birds,
1986640	1993680	only 30 survive and they get there. But they don't find Seymour. They don't find this thing,
1993680	2000480	this big bird, this mythological creature. They understand that they are Seymour. And you know
2000480	2009440	what Seymour means in Persian is C means 30 and more means bird. So 30 birds, they survive and
2009440	2015600	they realize they are actually the one. Yes. Yes. So that reminded me totally of that.
2016720	2021440	I got to get this. I've heard of this and I've never read it, but I'm going to order it once
2021440	2027280	we're done speaking because I've got to read this. This is wonderful mythos. So this brings us into
2028160	2033600	that by which, and this is where Kant struggles, in fact, and where I'm trying to be very much
2033600	2041920	more influenced by Corban. Yes. Ibn Arabi, Corban, in some ways sort of already the imaginal as that
2041920	2048240	which bridges between the one and the mini and the inner and the outer. And it's not the imaginary.
2048240	2053120	We don't look at these images. They are like icons. We look through them like the way I'm
2053120	2058080	looking through my glasses. But it is also the way in which the world can reach back through them
2058080	2068880	into us. It is not that way. It's both ways. It is in a sense. Go ahead. It's so wonderful that
2068880	2074800	you invoke this idea. And I think this is so important to understand that the imaginal is,
2075760	2081520	again, not a thing. And that's why we think imaginary or imagination or imaginal is not
2081520	2087440	something real, but it is deeply real because it has this power. It's something like a catalyst.
2087440	2094000	And I learned this also when you look at, and that's why I love coming from the place of children
2094000	2098320	and adolescents as a psychotherapist for children and adolescents and working and researching on
2098320	2104080	them. You learn so many things. And again, this is also what I want to add to IFS and to this whole
2104080	2110080	ecology of awakening to meaning and all of that because you can learn so many things from them.
2110080	2121520	I mean, Rodgers, Carl Rodgers, he was a school counselor, guidance guide. And you learned
2121520	2130240	so well from developmental psychologists. Like when you take Piaget or other development psychologists
2130560	2135440	Mahler or even Winnicott, when you have this kid, let's say it's two or three years old,
2135440	2141600	right? And it has to learn this normative developmental task of separation, the modern infant
2141600	2148960	separation. And in psychoanalytic theory, you would call, what it needs to is it has to have this,
2150080	2156480	how would they call this object, like the doll?
2157440	2160720	There's the, it's a transitional object.
2160720	2165840	Transitional object, exactly. They have the transitional objects. I only had the German name
2165840	2173600	for it. And it's a serious play. It's a catalyst. It's this imaginal thing that they involved in
2173600	2180000	so that they can understand. And I think this is where it comes together, is that how can I have
2180000	2187760	my mother's love, while at the same time, be able to differentiate, right? So you bring in
2187760	2194480	the spirit of the mother of the caregiver, into this liminal space, and I would say into the
2194480	2199840	playground, when we talk about this, when we talk about this play. And Winnicott would too.
2199840	2207200	Yes, exactly. And I would, and this is where I would want to add Vygotsky to, right? Yes.
2207200	2211600	Yeah. I love what you're doing here. You're bringing Vygotsky and Winnicott together
2211600	2216320	with the imaginal. Please go, go on. Yes. And I think it's so important because
2216960	2222880	what it does is that the doll or the transitional object that I'm playing with, what I do is I
2222880	2231120	immerse into, into something that, that catches me, that is outside of my faculties. At the same
2231120	2234880	time, it's in me and it grips me. And I think where Vygotsky comes in is that
2235920	2241680	it's, it's this, the zone of proximal development. I think where we really transform and develop
2241680	2250960	is this imaginal space, because it is between this overload and the under load. It's between
2250960	2257200	the infinite and the finite. And that's why I think it's into essay, right? So it's my interest
2257200	2263600	that guides me, that guides me into this imaginal, liminal space where I can, where I can have,
2263600	2269040	you know, have the cake and eat it too, right? So I have the spirit of the caregiver at the same
2269040	2274080	time I have the spirit of individuation. And this only can happen when I have this catalyst,
2274080	2280480	this, in this sense, transitional object or the serious play. And I think interest is such a
2280480	2286400	wonderful marker. And what happens is that there's so interesting research, I'm sure you know about,
2286400	2293280	about private speech, right? So when you, and I think, again, this is where IFS comes into play.
2293280	2296800	It's this dialogical practice. Now, what, what developmental psychologists
2297360	2304320	talk about when you talk about private speech or self talk is that you can observe this behavior.
2305040	2311680	A kid is in exactly in this liminal or, or imaginal space or in the zone of proximal
2311680	2319360	development when it starts to talk to itself, but not internally, they talk loudly to themselves.
2319360	2323440	Yes. Yes. They
2323440	2324160	have to talk aloud to
2325440	2330320	exactly. And what I think what happens is that we, we, we, we, we complexify, we
2330880	2334560	particularly raise, we individual way, no, sorry, not individual but
2334560	2340800	individual in a sense, but you know, differentiate in a sense. And what we do is then by this,
2342480	2347600	we learn how to internalize those voices, let's say of the caregiver or the parent,
2348400	2354640	and then we talk to ourselves. And I think this aspect of dialogical self is so important.
2355280	2360480	And this is actually where development happens. And I think IFS, and I would say now two things
2360480	2370800	about this. In one sense, IFS helps us through this inner dialogical self process. At the same
2370800	2378160	time, I think IFS can still also learn from the practice of children and adolescents and enhance
2378160	2384320	its own methodology. And that's why I think it's so important to bring in back those aspects of
2384640	2390640	of childhood and adolescence too. So yeah, I'm sorry, I shut up now. So what do you do?
2390640	2395600	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that was beautiful. First of all, I'm going to have to
2395600	2400720	remember to cite you on this, this bridging between you made between the imaginal and then
2400720	2405200	transitional object and Winnecott, and then integrating that with Bogotsky. And of course,
2405200	2408560	when the child starts to talk to themselves, that's how they develop metacognition,
2408560	2413520	exactly essential for essential for rationality. And I think that and for self direction,
2413520	2419680	long term planning, all of that stuff, even sense of self is modified significantly.
2420480	2424400	I think that's right. I think the fact that I have a book, I haven't read it yet,
2425120	2431440	a person looking at self talk. That's another name for the private speech, right? And the
2431440	2438480	fact that we devote so much time for it means it probably has some very powerful adaptive
2438480	2444240	functionality. And yet we don't investigate it. We treat it as noise or silliness or some bad habit.
2445040	2449840	This is because we're bound up to the buffered self that Charles Taylor's talked about. We're
2449840	2455440	bound to the monadic self. We don't realize, no, no, talking to yourself is like, you will kind
2455440	2460880	of go insane if you don't do that. I imagine there might be some people who transcend to a
2461840	2466720	witness consciousness. But I think of Castaway and I think of Wilson and how powerful Wilson
2466720	2475280	became, right? And the profound grief, a spoiler, by the way, the profound grief that
2476000	2484320	Tom Hanks's character has when he loses Wilson. And I think all of that is just
2484640	2492400	so pregnant with something that is deeply culturally relevant, significant, pertinent to
2492400	2497360	addressing the meaning crisis. Because I'll just make a quick proposal to you. I think part of
2497360	2505200	what drives the meaning crisis is this notion of the monadic self, the single static substance
2505200	2512240	self. And because that drives us into a kind of nominalism, it drives us into a radical
2512240	2520000	self other adversarial kind of processing. It's an important driver. And it makes us resistant
2520000	2524560	to alternative states of consciousness, because they are seen merely as deviants from the true
2525360	2532640	self or something like that. And so I think I'm proposing to you that I think IFS and related
2533360	2538560	practices, you know, there's, you know, empty chair therapy. Yes. There's ally work. And I'm
2538640	2545440	talking a lot with Barnaby about this, right? I think all of these things are attempts to both
2545440	2550880	bottom up from practice, real transformative practice and top down from theory, provide us with
2550880	2558160	a significant and rich alternative to the monadic self. I absolutely agree. I think this whole idea
2558160	2567600	of monad is difficult. Because I think it's also bound to this idea of having and being in the
2567680	2572640	having. Oh, yes. And I think this is much about, yeah, it's modal confusion all the way through.
2572640	2580720	It's modal confusion. And this and being trapped in the having mode, I think is one of the most
2580720	2586880	important drivers of the meaning crisis. And again, now we can circle back to what I, how I, you know,
2586880	2597440	in my own biography, saw how not only the the bad place that we are in, but also how IFS played
2597440	2604240	in into this. So, and again, I think there are two ways now to where we can connect to the
2604240	2610800	meaning crisis again. And one is via the mental health crisis in adolescence and the in the
2610800	2615120	meaning crisis in adolescence. And we can talk about this in a second. And the other one is,
2615680	2623520	again, this missing anthropology that I see in modern human science, and to related fields like
2623520	2629040	medicine, psychiatry and psychotherapy, etc. And I think it's devastatingly contributing to the
2629040	2635840	meaning crisis. And I saw this. And again, I see this in practice. And also in my research,
2635840	2640960	and because there we have these deep problems with the current notions and our theoretical
2640960	2649200	notions of of psychopathology, that's one, but also as well with this evidence based translation
2649200	2656720	into into treatment. And, and there are several reasons that we can, you know, have have a whole,
2656720	2662400	you know, podcast on this alone, but they're like, understanding illness is something
2663040	2669440	as symptom aggregates, which is, you know, a deception or, again, the ignorance of non-urgidicity,
2669440	2675600	right? So independent, assuming independent events, then committing ecological fallacies,
2675600	2683120	right? The generalizability to individual problem. There are like deviation from protocols. If you
2683120	2687600	if you deviate from the protocol, which is actually only protocol for randomized control trial,
2687600	2693040	then it's, it's not, you know, it's bad practice or pseudoscience. And there, there are plethora
2693040	2697600	of problems, which I again, I would say it's a lack of proposition and non propositional knowing.
2698240	2704720	So by reducing, again, I'm not, I'm not saying or advocating that evidence based is wrong or
2704720	2709840	bad. I want to be clear about this. I think evidence. Yeah, I get and you get that. I think we
2709840	2716560	have to go beyond this notion of non propositional, of propositional and bring back all those other
2716560	2722080	piece you talk about into this. And this is where I really see this landscape that it's missing. And
2722080	2728080	it's, and it's, it is deeply problematic because we have this dehumanized anthropology. And
2728080	2735840	it's so interesting. Roland May talks about this and the discovery of being, he actually,
2735840	2742320	he points to the behavior modification therapies. And by training, I am a behavioral therapist.
2742320	2746240	So I have deep sympathy for that. I think there was a lot of wisdom in it, because there is,
2746240	2753120	it's embodied, you do things, you experience things. So, but what he wonderfully points out is that
2753120	2758560	especially in those types, we have this, we have this missing anthropology, we actually don't have
2758560	2764400	a conception of men, of human beings. So, and I think this is deeply, deeply difficult. And now,
2764400	2769360	I don't know if you know this, John, but what happens right now in the field of bioethics is
2769360	2775920	that there is a return to phenomenology, actually. Oh, that's good news. That's really, really
2775920	2782560	interesting. There is this philosopher. He's called Frederick Sveneos. He's a, he's Swedish.
2783120	2788160	And he has this book, even it's called Phenomenological Bioethics. And it's so interesting,
2788160	2794560	because there are several scholars and people in this academic field that argue now for even a
2794560	2801920	definition of illness, being defined as a meaning crisis, as a crisis. Oh, wow. Yes. And that's so
2801920	2808320	interesting. It's even called illness as, and now listen to the language as an unhome-like being in
2808320	2817360	the world. DSEs, like going back to the etymology of the original word. Yes. So, fortunately,
2817360	2822240	this happens. But I think all those technological advancements, and we know this, you talk about
2822240	2830800	this all the time, that they, the technological changes happen before the meaning crisis and
2830800	2836160	et cetera. So there is this whole disenchantment that runs through this modernity, also runs through
2836160	2842640	medicine and psychotherapy, et cetera. So I think this is what I'm really concerned about. And again,
2842640	2850960	meaning is, so what we can, the lesson that we can get out of is that meaning is not an epiphenomenon.
2850960	2857600	It's not easily dispensed with. It's crucial. It's necessary, even from a bioethical standpoint,
2857600	2864960	right? And again, because we're more than just a sum of, you know, cogs and gear wheels and
2864960	2872080	this mechanistic, reductionistic thing. And now there's Thomas Fuchs. He's actually a professor
2872080	2878320	of phenomenological psychiatry. He has this Carl Yaspas. He's a professor for Carl Yaspas in
2878400	2882880	Heidelberg, I think. He makes this. Oh, I love. Yeah, he makes this wonderful point that medicine
2882880	2890480	is actually a relational medicine is relational. It's a relational, I don't know what to call
2890480	2898320	science, but a practice. It's a relational practice. So. Wow. Who is that second person? Does he have
2898320	2906880	a book or Thomas Fuchs? He has lots of books. Oh, I think he even has one in English. He publishes
2906880	2912320	a lot in German, but there is one. I will forward it to you or I can look it up in a second. Thomas
2912320	2919360	Fuchs. Really interesting. I had the privilege to talk to him once in a conference. So, yeah,
2919360	2926080	it's, I mean, it is there, but it's still concerning. And so to me, to me, it was, again,
2926080	2932000	by gravity to link my work to the meaning crisis and to IFS is that to me, it was clear from the
2932000	2938160	get go from the beginning that we're not only in a funerary predicament, but also in the spiritual
2938160	2944080	one. And yeah, obviously due to our affinity and it's related to that, but there is this deep
2944080	2949120	spiritual deprivation that we have. And you see this when you work. I mean, I worked in oncology.
2949920	2954000	Meaning is really, really important. And even the evidence based practice,
2954560	2960240	you have meaning centered psychotherapy that is actually you have efficacy right there. So it's
2960240	2968080	actually Victor Frankl's logotherapy revisited and done for oncology. It's done by Breitbart,
2968080	2973920	his called, he's a wonderful researcher. And it's getting there. And again, working with adolescence
2973920	2978720	and especially those auto line types and in this crisis center that I'm working with is that
2979360	2982800	it's so salient. It's so present. And it's so
2983760	2992640	obvious that we are lacking this how we meet a person. And, and IFS helps me there to to again to
2992640	2999520	meet and not to reduce it to some, I mean, obviously a model is always prone to reductionism, and I
2999520	3006640	can reduce you to your protectors or managers or exiles to, but it helps me if done correctly again,
3007600	3013920	I think it helps me to, to connect to the human being again. And, and this is where I see IFS
3013920	3018240	helping because John, ultimately what I think, and let's see what do you think about this?
3018240	3023040	I'm sorry, if I'm talking that much. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're great. Keep going.
3024240	3027360	Ultimately, what I see what is happening is that
3029520	3036480	this momentum of healing in especially experience in IFS, but I think it goes beyond IFS. I
3036480	3040560	think IFS is just the proxy. It's a placeholder for what is happening is there.
3041440	3050480	What happens is that agape heals. I see it as a deep agape love that happens. And I see this
3051440	3057680	in therapy interpersonally, right, this, this, this horizontal axis you're talking about. But I
3057680	3064960	also see it in the, within the model itself in those, in this, in those technical steps
3064960	3071680	you do, especially for example, you talk about the Socratic shift, right. And, and I want to propose
3071680	3078560	that before we do the Socratic shift, we need the process of validation. I can't get you to change
3079200	3084720	and to into the state of a poria. I mean, I could, but it's only, maybe it's not long lasting,
3084720	3091760	I get back into this attractive state after a while. But if I really am with a part, I am with
3091760	3096960	a partner, it's like being with a part, right? It's like I validate you. Validating means that
3096960	3103680	you are valid. Your whole reason, your raison d'être, the reason of being, it's, it's valid. You,
3103680	3109680	you have a reason to be there. You're functioning, you're, you're framing whatever you do. It's,
3109680	3114480	it's so important that you get acknowledged because what I think, I think I want to propose
3114480	3121600	to you, John, that we do the Socratic shift a little bit later. So before we do the Socratic
3121600	3128640	shift, we validate, because if we don't do this, we get into again, the having mode, and then it's
3128640	3137360	again the court, not the courtyard, but the courtroom of debate. It's not the courtyard of, of the
3137360	3145680	dialogue, but it's the courtroom of debate. Because if I just spill this over you, and I, and I, and I,
3148800	3154160	it's, it's, well, well, let me reply. Yes, yes, please. Okay. So first of all,
3156000	3162800	to your point, a couple minutes past that, you know, propositional tyranny has infected medicine,
3162800	3166560	and we've lost, we've lost touch with the non propositional knowing, and that's where a lot of
3166560	3172640	the meaning participation occurs. And the meaning participation is a fundamental being together,
3172640	3178000	being with, and that's part of what participatory knowing is, knowing by being with.
3178000	3183200	Exactly. And so all of that, I think, I think that tracks very well. It goes to the work I'm
3183200	3191280	doing with Terry Dentry about trying to open up what we mean by health and, and, and medicine.
3191280	3197680	And so I'm completely constant with that. I think the thing you're, you're saying right now, I, I take,
3198480	3205280	I mean, it is, it is exemplary constructive criticism. I think you're right. I, and this goes
3205280	3209680	to what Seth Allison was talking about, where, where you're talking about Agapa, he talks about
3209680	3214640	integrating attachment theory and IFS, and you actually have attachment relationships with
3214640	3220800	your parts. And you have to bring in sort of EFT, Emotion Focus Therapy kind of techniques
3220800	3225120	to get into proper relation. And then I said to him, once you're doing that, what I've done,
3225120	3228640	though, is I've also brought, and maybe this is the bridging, I sort of bring some of the
3228640	3233520	Socratic into my interaction with my parts, because I try to get them to recognize their
3233520	3239920	function. I try to recognize, get them to, I try to enhance their own self-awareness and their own,
3239920	3245520	therefore, responsibility to themselves. So they go from just enacting their functionality to
3245520	3253280	reflecting on it, which also opens up spaces of possibility for them, which I think is.
3254080	3258000	And that's great. I learned that actually from you. And I, and I actually,
3258560	3263440	now I'm trying to incorporate it more into my practice. I love this Socratic move and shift.
3263440	3268560	Actually, when you, when you said that in, I think it was episode eight in, in, after Socrates,
3268560	3275280	it's like, whoa, yeah, I've never done this, you know, do the Socratic shift on the part. It's like,
3275280	3282000	wow. Yeah. But I think that you and Seth are correct that it's premature to do that unless the
3282000	3288800	attachment issues and the, and the, and the, and the reciprocal recognition has taken place. The
3288800	3295440	being with has to be in place, right? In order to shift you out of the having mode, in order to open
3295440	3302320	you up for the real possibility of genuine Socratic practice, as opposed to just using or having a
3302400	3306720	Socratic technique, that's how I would put it. And I think you are exactly right about that.
3306720	3311360	And I've been trying to incorporate that in to my practice, and we are going to try and see how we
3311360	3317680	can feed this in. We see the problem the Verveke Foundation faces is we, we, one of our stead
3317680	3324160	past principles is we are not offering therapy because we are not properly vetted or certified
3324160	3329440	to do that. We have, we have affiliate relationships with therapists who can come in if people
3329520	3335680	hit crisis or distress, but we, our practices are not therapy and trying to figure out how to get
3335680	3339760	that what you just said, which I agree. Do you see the problem we're struggling with? Absolutely.
3339760	3345680	Right. It's like what you said, I think is deeply right, but we will not offer therapy
3345680	3352160	for principled reasons, right? I think then genuine bioethical reasons, we will not do that. And so
3352160	3357120	there's a struggle here. And maybe, you know, off-camera, you know, you and Chris and Taylor
3357120	3364560	and I could talk about maybe a way of doing this that could, could pick up on, I think, the very
3364560	3370000	legitimate point you just made while still respecting our ethical requirements of not
3370000	3376400	engaging in therapy. And can I add to that? I want to compliment you for that. I think
3377280	3382080	it is actually, even from, from the ethos, it's the right or the tell us, it's the right move.
3382960	3387200	I think, and this is again, the problem that I have and that I was trying to allude to when I,
3387200	3392800	when I talk about evidence-based practices in psychotherapy, I think it's, it's, it's a fatal
3392800	3399440	mistake. And again, contributing to the meaning crisis, if we pathologize everything, not everything
3399440	3406400	has to be a psychotherapeutic modality and intervention or technique. Now, obviously,
3406400	3412560	it can inform our practices, but I, but for it to be pathological, I think it's way more important.
3413360	3418400	So I think therapy can help there, the techniques. And to be fair, the Socratic move that I'm
3418400	3423760	proposing, IFS accounts for it. Now, this is when you do the integration, what you do when you talk
3423760	3428720	to the exile, for example, and then you have this unburdening, and now we don't have to go into the
3428720	3434320	details right now, but you invite back the protector. And now you do do Socratic move,
3434320	3440080	now you hopefully do the aporian. And you say, now how can you contribute to the,
3440080	3445840	to the state after the alleviation of pain and suffering, after the unburdening? Now, again,
3445840	3450640	I still think that you're right. And I think, and I, and I love that you're doing the pathological
3450640	3459920	work because again, I think it's, I'm, I'm actually really afraid of the fact that we,
3459920	3464080	that we are pathologizing everything, especially when it comes to adolescence. And
3465280	3469360	you know, we talked about the archetype of the adolescent, and we should talk about this maybe
3469360	3477440	another time, but it's the idiosyncrasies of, of adolescents are so important and crucial.
3478000	3482880	And we tend to, I mean, not only with regards to adolescents, we tend to pathologize a lot of
3482880	3490320	things. So I'm deeply grateful for the work of the Viveki Foundation, but not just, you know, being
3491440	3497600	psychoterapeutical, but it's more pathological. I think it's a wonderful and noble thing to do, John.
3499120	3506160	Thank you. But and you, of course, are coming back because I do want to talk about the archetype
3506160	3511840	of the adolescent and how it fits. I can talk about everything for like, or anything for like hours
3511840	3516320	with you. Well, honestly, I think talking with you and having other people hear what you have to
3516320	3527280	say, I think is extremely valuable. Yeah, I mean, so I just, yeah, I do want to pick your brain
3527280	3532480	and your colleagues about that particular problem. I, we don't, I'm not asking us to solve it here,
3532480	3536560	and this is not the right place to try and solve it. But I do think, you know, there's a way of,
3536560	3542240	I want to recognize, I want to recognize and be responsible to the truth you've articulated,
3542240	3546880	while still, still being governed by the principle, the ethical principle that I've
3546880	3551440	articulated. And that's a tricky thing to do. And trying to figure out how to do that is
3551440	3557520	something I'd like to talk about. Yeah, it's a dance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, it's,
3557520	3564160	it's a very careful dance. I want to, I want to bring back a little bit about, because you've,
3564160	3570160	you've said it a few times and it's deeply, deeply impactful to me. And we had to talk about other
3570160	3574720	things. I wasn't able to pick it up, but I want to pick it up now. Yes. So you've often invoked,
3574720	3581280	you know, and I think the self is metaxu. This is the ancient Greek word for between. I think the
3581280	3588960	self, well, I should be careful. This is Highland's interpretation of what the, the central argument
3588960	3594560	of Plato was, which is we are the relationship between finitude and ultimacy, between finitude
3594560	3602080	and transcendence. And if we, if we try to identify with either one of the poles, and if we lose the
3602080	3607200	polarity and try to identify with either one of the poles, we either fall into cert, into
3607200	3615840	servile despair, or we, we go through inflationary hubris and spirituality in the, in the proper
3615840	3621520	sense, in the, or at least sorry, that was inappropriate. Spirituality in the Platonic
3621520	3630800	sense that would be proper to Plato's framework is that we enable, we induce and educate, we draw
3630800	3636880	out and we also transform people so that they are capable of holding that tonus, that creative
3636880	3643520	tension between that, like a profound opponent processing that gives them the most profound
3643520	3649920	optimal grip on their fundamental orientation reality is you have to get this opponent processing
3649920	3658240	between your finitude and your transcendence, right, between, right, how you are as a, as a single
3658960	3664800	being and the relationship you have to ultimacy, but that you are that tonus. You're like the
3664800	3671040	tension of the bow as Heraclitus talks about the logos of the, of the psyche, right? And that,
3671040	3675520	and that, that is kind of the deepest, most profound opponent processing and that is the
3675520	3681520	source of our deepest, most profound optimal gripping, our most profound orientation.
3682160	3687120	And I want, I want to know it because you've invoked the, that, those, that pair multiple
3687120	3694080	times in our conversation. How does that proposal land to you that that's a deep thing? I'm about
3694080	3699520	to teach a course for the Reveki Foundation on literature and the meaning crisis and wrestling
3699520	3705680	with these books in which you see human beings wrestling with the meaning crisis and it's
3705680	3711920	precisely the way the meaning crisis throws this tonus into WAP and either drives people into despair
3711920	3717920	or drives them into inflation. The heart of darkness is a, is a classic example or Moby Dick,
3717920	3724880	right? Do you think, sorry, this was a long preamble, but I hope it's landing. Do you think that
3725680	3733200	IFS, especially because it's doing the imaginal, it's getting us related to the transitional
3733200	3739600	object, it's moving us out of the matter itself, getting us to inhabit and be a Metaxu, a pure,
3739600	3746640	a purely relational being in the deep relation to relationality, which is ultimate. Do you think
3746640	3754720	IFS in there for can help us with this fundamental commitment to our true humanity, which is the
3754720	3761280	tonus, the creative tension, the opponent processing between finitude and transcendence? Do you think
3761280	3770720	that is that just too far afield or is it a good situation? Because to me, it seems that a big part
3770720	3777360	of the meaning crisis is the way we lose the polarity and we get attracted to either one of
3777360	3783840	these poles in either nihilism or narcissism and they're not opposites. They are two sides of the
3783920	3792320	same coin. Yes. Wow, what a question. I hope I can be fair to this question because obviously I'm
3792320	3800400	not, I cannot speak for the whole IFS community, but only from my perspective of it. But I think IFS
3800400	3806800	has the potential to do so. Now, again, with the monad, I think, or the having mode, I don't think
3806800	3813360	it's the panacea. You said it yourself. It cannot be a panacea. It has to be embedded in an ecology,
3814080	3819440	and no matter what method, technique, paradigm, whatever you want to use,
3820800	3831680	there are ways to do it good or better and worse. So I think it has the potential to do so.
3832480	3838080	And I think if IFS is done properly with this whole sapiential framework around it,
3838880	3847440	then I think it's so powerful. But I've also seen people, again, being trapped in the having mode
3847440	3854480	at the same time using IFS and do the spiritual bypassing. So I think it's a matter of, it's the
3854480	3862960	how-ness, how we do things that matters more than the what-ness, right? Well, you know, that's a
3863040	3870080	standard definition, or at least the distinction between knowledge, which is a what, and wisdom is
3870080	3880640	the how. Yeah. So again, to be, yeah, I think if done properly, it has, because I think of this
3880640	3887200	essentially agopic element to it. And I really think, and this is what I see happening in therapy,
3887200	3897600	John, there is this magical moment happening if you, and I'm at, in this time, I'm really proud
3897600	3904080	to be part of it, to participate in it. When you, when, and I'm, and I think I'm privileged to witness
3904080	3911360	healing at times. Now, and this is so interesting, I don't consider myself as, as the one that
3911360	3919520	heals. I only participate in it. And it's so interesting because Plato has this critique of
3920160	3930560	therapy, a theon, and anything, because it relates to this, to God, right, to theon. And, but, but
3930560	3937600	therapy, a theon, I think it's, if you properly do it, what therapy means, or theon means, or
3937680	3944400	therapy means in this case is that, in its deep sense, etymologically, is it's your certain,
3944400	3949760	your servant of God. Now, I think what happens in those moments in the therapy room is when
3949760	3956800	you witness healing is that you are part of something bigger, what you're relating to. And,
3957680	3962640	and, and it's a beautiful thing that happens. And that's why there, you can invoke the
3962640	3967440	anesthesis, right, the, the perception, the aesthetics, these, and that's why I think that
3967440	3973600	beauty is the, as the primary thing is absolutely correct. It has this beautiful, elegant thing
3973600	3980480	to it. And, and, and what IFAS brings here is this moment of not only of logos, where the good,
3980480	3986240	the true, and the beautiful, I think where, where they are one is actually the logos, I think in
3986240	3990800	meaning is where the good, the true, and the beautiful are actually, you cannot, they're not
3990800	3995760	the same thing, but at the same time, you cannot, you know, they're not separated, right? And, and,
3995760	4001920	and, and this, this wonderful, you said that IFAS is platonic and Jungian, I would also say it's
4001920	4009920	Augustinian, in the sense that it's, it's agape, right? This moment of love that's happening is
4009920	4017760	what transcends both. And this is what Jung also referred to is that when it's, or Rogers too,
4017760	4024240	in the sense that when, when good, when you need a soul, there is this potential transformation
4024240	4029360	for both of them. And I often have this, have this feeling that when I go out, you know, when I
4029360	4036480	have my session, when they're done, I am changed myself. Yeah. Yeah. So I hope I was fair to your,
4036480	4043600	to your question. You're more than fair. You brought, I really, really enjoy talking with you.
4043600	4050560	This is really just catching fire. Thanks for me. So I thought, thought what you said was great.
4050560	4056320	We're, we're coming to a close. I'd like to bring up one question. And then I want to,
4056320	4059520	but first I want to propose what we could talk about next time. First of all, I think I want to
4059520	4063440	give you space and time to talk about the archetype of the adolescent. I think that's
4063440	4068880	important. Yeah, that will be, and I think that, I think it's essential. Yeah, necessary, especially
4068880	4072480	for the mental health crisis, especially for the meeting crisis. I think, I think you're
4072480	4078160	bang on about that. The second thing I want to talk to you about is now that we broached,
4078160	4083280	you invoked Agape, you invoked the possibility of something bigger and God, the logos. I mean,
4083280	4088240	this has to do, and there's also Jung, and you know, the red book, and he has Philemon, and he has
4088240	4093840	these, these, these, these, you know what I'm talking about, and there's no good name for them. I
4093840	4099280	mean, Ralph calls them allies. And of course, I've had this experience, and I've been doing ally work,
4099360	4104640	and I'd like to hear, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not expecting you to be an expert on this or anything.
4104640	4110480	I just want your reflections from an IFS. I've been asking Seth Allison about this and other people
4111360	4115440	about this. And we, so if we could talk about those two things, we'll talk about the, the, well,
4115440	4119920	that we got a triple A here, the archetype of the adolescent and the ally. If we could talk about
4119920	4125920	that next time, I would appreciate that. That would be great. Okay. And so thank you for that.
4125920	4131360	Thank you. And what I'd like to talk to you about right now is our final point. And it, it's a
4131360	4138720	Socratic point, which means I hope it comes off as constructive. So I think all of, all of this is
4138720	4147200	very, very well said. And then a Socratic concern would be, and this is one of the critiques I've
4147200	4158400	had of sort of romanticism, right? Which is, how do we look for notice and ameliorate self-deception
4158400	4163920	that might arise in all of this work? Because pretending that there's no self-deception at
4163920	4170880	play in this, I think is foolish. And I seriously doubt that you would make, engage in that pretense.
4170880	4178800	So how, so here, here's the concern. Within therapy, I understand you are beholding to the
4178800	4184000	goal of healing. And that is important. But given a lot of things we've said, and given that we're
4184000	4190960	trying to make connections outside of therapy, to pedagogy, and where there are deeper goals of,
4190960	4196240	you know, right relationship to reality and the true, the good and the beautiful, the virtue,
4196240	4203120	then this issue around self-deception, I think comes up. And I would like to know, and if you want,
4203120	4207760	if you want to bleed into the next, our next conversation to address this more, that's fine.
4207760	4214480	But maybe just an initial concern. How do, and I mean, I mean it in that, I mean it in the
4214480	4222000	Platonic sense. How is rationality as the concern for self-deception, which can often mask as
4222000	4234880	self-transcendence, right? How is that concern properly, properly met? How can we be responsible
4234880	4242720	to that within an IFS practice? Is that a fair question? That's a very important question.
4243840	4250080	I really have to think about it more deeply to give an appropriate answer. But I would say the
4250080	4259280	initial, the initial response would be, and this goes back to the question you had before,
4260000	4266400	and I forgot to mention it because I also have critique for IFS. And I think now this comes
4266400	4274000	together, I think what IFS still can do better is to enhance the notion of something like
4274720	4281680	evil. And I think the ally work that you're alluding to and the archetypal work,
4282800	4289520	you know, the Hillman work, that is, I think that is still missing. Now, to be fair, IFS
4289520	4296000	is not one thing. This community has very diverse thinkers and there are, of course,
4296000	4301760	beautiful people that bring, that bring different aspects to it. But I would say to answer your
4301760	4309280	question is to address the self-deception is that I think it needs to be embedded within a system
4309840	4318080	of systems. And I think what we need to do in order to overcome self-deception is that
4319200	4325040	we cannot overlook the body. And I think this is very, very important. And there is this
4326000	4332400	brand of IFS, which is called Somatic IFS. Susan McConnell, she's wonderful. She's actually one
4332400	4339440	of those that close friends to Dick Schwartz who actually made the whole curriculum for the training
4339440	4344720	of IFS. So she's a brilliant mind. And she has this book, I have Somatic Experience, I don't know
4344720	4350240	if you know this. I have it. Oh, awesome. She writes really poetically and beautifully. I think so,
4350240	4357600	the body work is needed. And this is, I think, something you know as a practitioner of Tai Chi
4357600	4364960	Chuan and Greg Kelly. And we need to bring back the body. But we also need feedback systems and
4364960	4371520	people can be feedback systems, right? So if I do this work alone, so I have to have a community
4371520	4383760	to do so. And this witnessing of healing is, again, it's tenfold if you witness it in the
4383760	4390000	community of healing. And I was privileged or I'm privileged to experience that over and over again
4390000	4394160	and say what happens when a collective comes together. Now, I think there is also a danger,
4394960	4400240	right? And this is also what Jung talks about when he talks about being one and not a zero.
4400240	4404880	It's like, okay, well, you have this or Nietzsche when he talks about the mass is going to one
4404880	4413840	direction, the ideological thing. So I really have to think about it.
4414800	4422000	Well, I mean, it links what, so let's just say that that's your initial foray and we'll come back
4422000	4427840	to it next time. But what you said does connect with what you said before about IFS needs to be
4427840	4434720	situated within a sapiential framework and ecology of practices. But I like your invocation of,
4434720	4441120	you know, Rafe Kelly's work, the stuff on embodiment. I think that is deeply appropriate.
4441760	4449920	This is Marla Ponti that the body is really fundamental to keeping us anchored to the world
4449920	4459120	in a way that if we train the mind to properly listen, can act as, you know, a significant
4459120	4465040	counterbalance to spiritual bypassing and hubristic self-deception and other things.
4465040	4471920	So let's pick that up then. We'll pick up that in addition to the archetype of the adolescent
4471920	4484560	and ally work. We can talk a little bit more about bringing Ratio, a logos in the in
4484560	4491280	rationality in the Socratic-Platonic sense into conversation with IFS. So I really look forward
4491280	4499200	to this. I love my guests. This was, first of all, just, wow, really catching fire. Love this,
4499280	4507360	love this. You have a brilliant and scintillating mind, and yet it is clear that it is connected to
4507360	4514160	your heart. And I just, just enjoyed that. I talk about, you know, how certain people taste,
4514160	4522560	right, like the way, a work of art, you know, you taste really wonderfully. So that, I really
4522640	4528960	appreciate that. But I'd like to give my guests, I'd like to give my guests the last word.
4530560	4538800	Thank you, John. I deeply appreciate it. I don't know what to say. I'm grateful to be able to,
4538800	4544480	you know, to be talking to you. It's something that I've wanted now for years. And I think now
4544480	4549920	the time is right. And also, with regards to your viewers and followers,
4551920	4559360	I really think it's, it's, it's a kairos. I think we are at a pivotal point where things now come
4559360	4569920	together. And I want to thank you for everything you've done and you do. And I consider you a
4569920	4575680	really close friend. I mean, we haven't met personally yet. We can become that.
4575680	4582880	Yes, I hope so too. And we are 10,000 kilometers apart. But I don't know if you know this, but
4584400	4591600	you are, your voice and your spirit is, you know, fills my home and life and work every day. So,
4591600	4598080	in a sense, you're, you know, very close to me on a daily basis. And to be able to participate in
4598080	4605440	this whole endeavor is I'm really, really grateful for. And I want to thank you for also allowing
4605440	4610160	and giving the platform to come together. So thank you for that, John.
4612160	4618000	So we will speak again very soon. I would like that. I would love that, actually. Thank you.
4618000	4624240	Hello, everyone. I'd like to announce a new course. I'm going to be teaching at Halcyon Academy.
4624240	4629440	It's called Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond. I'll talk in a minute about that very provocative title.
4631200	4636640	First important things. It's going to be starting April 5th. It will be eight weeks,
4636640	4641920	not eight consecutive weeks, because I'm attending conferences, but it's all scheduled out. The link
4641920	4650960	to the home page for the course will be put in the notes to this promo. And each session will be
4650960	4658560	two hours. There'll be one hour of me doing a lecture and then one hour of Q&A. Now, there are
4658560	4664720	options you can purchase where you can attend the lecture live and participate in the live Q&A,
4664720	4671520	or you can also go through this course asynchronously and you can purchase it at that level if that
4671520	4677600	works better with your schedule and or your finances. I've done one of these courses before,
4677600	4687520	Beyond Nihilism, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I consider it, by all the feedback, a success,
4687520	4695760	and I very much wanted to follow it up, which gets me to the title. The Beyond was a way of
4695760	4700800	pointing to some continuity with the previous course, Beyond Nihilism, which is also available
4700880	4708800	asynchronously on Halkian, if you wish to take a look at that. I'm not assuming that people
4708800	4714960	have gone through Beyond Nihilism. The course Ultimate Reality, God and Beyond, is a standalone
4714960	4721680	course, but I've also structuring it so those people who have taken Beyond Nihilism will find
4721680	4727680	connection and continuity. That's a bit of a tricky thing to do as a teacher, but I do have quite a
4727680	4732720	bit of experience with doing that kind of thing for my many years of teaching at the university.
4733600	4740320	So that's one reason for the title. Now, the other title is God and Beyond. What could possibly be
4740320	4747600	beyond God? What could that mean? That's just a silly contradiction, isn't it? Well, that's the
4747600	4753840	issue. That's the issue that the course is going to wrestle with. When we come into or try to enter
4753840	4760480	into a philosophically reflective and deep relationship with what we consider to be Ultimate
4760480	4768320	Reality, is that relationship best captured by what we think of when we think of God? Now,
4768880	4772800	what many of you will say to me is that there's many different possible meanings,
4772800	4780160	and that's exactly what this course will explore. But the idea that there is a somewhat standard
4780160	4787920	notion, Abrahamic notion, perhaps, of God is one we'll be making use of, and whether or not
4787920	4792720	that actually is the best way of understanding Ultimate Reality.
4794480	4799120	So in order to do that, we'll be taking a look at a bunch of thinkers. The one is Robert Carter
4799760	4805520	in his amazing book, The Nothingness Beyond God, and you can see the title of that book,
4805600	4811360	Resonating with the title of the course, in which he explores the work of Nishita from the Kyoto
4811360	4818400	School, which is somebody deeply influenced by both Heidegger and Zen. And of course, Heidegger
4818400	4825360	famously, in his famous critique of ontotheology, criticized that our standard notion of God as a
4825360	4833840	Supreme Being fundamentally misrepresents being itself, because being itself is no kind of individual
4833840	4840160	thing or being. And that's the no-thingness beyond God. If God is some kind of super thing,
4840160	4844720	then Ultimate Reality is a no-thing beyond that. And that was explored, of course,
4844720	4849680	by Nishita, making use of both Heidegger and Zen. And we want to enter into discussion about this.
4850320	4855520	Please understand that this is a very exploratory thing. This course is helping me
4856640	4861680	do some deep thinking in dialogue with others who are coming in good faith and want to engage in
4861680	4867760	deep reflection and discussion in preparation for the next series I'm doing on the Philosophical
4867760	4876320	Silk Road. And so being part of the course is a way of participating in the contribution of
4876320	4883680	that project. We'll also be taking a look at the work of the Canadian atheist, Schellingbert,
4883680	4890240	especially in his book Evolutionary Religion, but we'll also be taking a look at all, at least,
4890240	4895520	be bringing in his book Religion and Religion After Science, and also talking about the
4895520	4899360	hiddenness argument. He is famous for being the author of the hiddenness argument,
4901040	4907120	which is considered a sort of new argument against the existence of a personal God. Now,
4907120	4914000	you may say, oh, an atheist. Be very careful. Schellingberg is not a typical atheist.
4914000	4923440	Schellingberg is somebody who wants us to look at, take very seriously the possibility of ultimate
4923440	4929920	reality and very seriously what he calls a triple transcendence. That ultimate reality
4929920	4937600	is transcendent in being most real. And also, it's also, in some sense, most valuable, you know,
4937680	4943680	beyond the true, the good, and the beautiful, and also most transformative. And he thinks this
4943680	4948480	proposal that human beings, that there is such an ultimate reality, that human beings can enter
4948480	4955280	into a relationship with it and be transformed by it, is one that we should take very seriously,
4955280	4961600	but within a particular frame. He says he points to deep time, how science has discovered deep
4961600	4968560	time, billions of years in the past, billions of years in the future. The species has existed
4968560	4974480	for 200,000 years. We seem to be spiritually oriented from about 40,000 BCE. So we have all
4974480	4982160	of this going on, and yet we also have this deep future ahead of us. And he poses this question.
4982800	4991440	He says, given the depth of the questions we're asking about ultimate reality, is it like
4992080	4997520	that we are mature enough as a species that we have got complete answers to this? When, of course,
4997520	5003200	we don't have complete answers about the nature of the atom, or that we don't have complete answers
5003200	5008720	about how disease works, or how the mind works, or how the body works. Isn't it presumptuous to
5008720	5017360	think that we have finished complete answers about ultimate reality? So he wants us to engage in
5017760	5024960	the reflect upon the proposal that we might be as a species, not individual, spiritually immature.
5025520	5034480	And then he asks, what do we need to do in order to mature ourselves across time and across generations
5035280	5041520	such that we could come into the kind of work that would give us
5042240	5050800	a plausible claim on getting an answer to that question of whether or not ultimate reality
5050800	5056960	has that triple transcendence for us. And I think this is a very profound idea, because I think the
5056960	5064400	deep time aspect of our reflections upon ultimate reality within standard axial age religion,
5065120	5072560	and philosophy has not been properly understood or taken into account. And so this is very
5072560	5078320	provocative. It opens us up and it, of course, allows science at the table. Now, of course,
5078320	5083120	he also criticizes, and this is what makes him so interesting, he also criticizes the atheists
5083120	5090320	who think they can come to a complete conclusion about ultimate reality from a framework that
5090400	5098720	is very plausibly one of spiritual immaturity. So we will be taking a look at that, and we'll be
5098720	5106720	looking at what happens if we adopt deep humility with respect to the question of ultimate reality,
5107280	5112400	God and beyond. What happens? What do we open ourselves up to? And what becomes really important
5112400	5119760	for him is the role, the aspirational role of imagination, especially in the imaginal sense.
5120880	5125520	We'll then be taking a look at the astonishing work of James Filler, who I will actually be
5125520	5131200	meeting in person in April. Unfortunately, his book is quite expensive, so instead we'll be reading
5131200	5138560	three papers where he makes the argument that the Neoplatonic tradition made an argument,
5138560	5145280	which is that ultimate reality is pure relationality rather than a substance. Now,
5145360	5149920	when he uses substance, he's ultimately meaning it in not just a Cartesian sense,
5149920	5155200	but in Aristotelian. Substance is our individual things that are considered to be able to exist
5155200	5161760	independently and are the subjects of properties. They're the owner of properties,
5161760	5168320	and they enter into relations with other things. And so there are things from which
5168320	5173840	relations emerge. And Filler's arguments go to show that that seems to have things exactly
5173840	5180320	the wrong way around. It looks like relationality is ultimate, and the things emerge out of it.
5180320	5185680	And so, of course, this relationality is a no thing, because that's just what things emerge from.
5186240	5190880	And this meshes, of course, with some of the fundamental arguments of Neoplatonism.
5192480	5199680	And I think moving off of that thing-based substance ontology is a fundamental shift,
5199680	5206880	a new way of thinking profoundly and relating to ultimate reality that takes us into that space
5206880	5214960	of God and beyond. The final person is Bracken, whose book The Divine Matrix is written from a
5214960	5219440	Whiteheadian perspective, which I think is very important, because Whitehead, in some ways,
5219440	5225440	integrates that pure relationality with the dynamic view of the world given to us by science.
5226000	5232560	But what he does is he takes a look, Bracken, at the Western traditions, reflections on ultimate
5232560	5240320	reality, and Eastern reflections, Taoism, Vedanta, Buddhism. And he is trying to propose
5240960	5245760	what we can see being held in common. And this, of course, is very much like a through line,
5245760	5250000	like the philosophical Silk Road. And he comes to some very interesting
5250480	5258240	conclusions from this argument about what ultimate reality is and how we could come to
5258240	5263280	a shared understanding. It doesn't mean we all will become Hindus, or we'll all become Buddhists,
5263280	5268240	or we'll all even become Whiteheadians, or that we will all become Christians or Jews.
5268240	5274080	What he says is this gives us a shareable relationship to ultimate reality between people
5274080	5280400	who talk about that ultimate reality as a God, and people like Taoists with the Tao,
5280400	5285440	or the Vedantas with Brahmin, or the Buddhists with Shunyata, who do not talk about ultimate
5285440	5293200	reality as God, but nevertheless consider it to be triply transcendent. And so this is all in
5293200	5299920	service of an observation that I have been sharing with a lot of the people that I enter
5299920	5305280	in deep discussion with, which is in response to the meaning crisis, there seems to be an advent
5305280	5310720	of the sacred taking place in many different parts of the world, different communities,
5310720	5314880	different philosophical currents. And I've just pointed to you a bunch. There's many,
5314880	5322560	many more that converge on this. People are fundamentally reframing our relationship to
5322560	5328640	ultimate reality. And I think this is a way of trying to give us a new way of living in
5328720	5335360	relationship to the sacred, which will offer people a living response to the problem of
5335360	5342320	the meaning crisis. Now, this is all something I am proposing. And I am proposing that we discuss
5342320	5349600	it together. And you help me as much as I try to teach you that we discuss it together as we
5349600	5356560	try to wrestle with this question about ultimate reality, God and beyond. So I look forward to
5356560	5363440	seeing you in the course. As I said, the notes for both the date, which starts on April the 5th,
5364000	5370400	and the link and how you can register will be found in the end, will contain the information
5370400	5376400	in the notes to this promo. So thank you very much. And I look forward to seeing you in ultimate
5376400	5378400	reality, God and beyond.
