00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Humor is inherently multi-perspectival, multi-espectual, and dialogical.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.480
Same thing with tragedy, right?

00:07.480 --> 00:12.720
So now here, again, like I did last time, I want to do this sort of semi-provocative

00:12.720 --> 00:16.000
thing with you because I can deeply trust you, right?

00:16.000 --> 00:24.480
Cryptoguard to me is great evidence of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy into a

00:24.480 --> 00:30.920
disclosure of how one can see the world the way Christ, the way Jesus did all, use my

00:30.920 --> 00:33.920
language if that's okay.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.920
Right.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.240
And we see humor clearly in Socrates.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.280
We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.

00:39.280 --> 00:46.440
We see it clearly, right, in many great sages, like Schwangse from the Taoist tradition is

00:46.440 --> 00:48.880
just humor after humor after.

00:48.880 --> 01:10.400
I don't see it in the Bible.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.000
Welcome back to After Socrates, episode 18, and we are continuing the series within the

01:16.000 --> 01:23.880
series where I am being joined and helped by my dear friend and collaborator, Christopher

01:23.880 --> 01:31.680
Master Petro, in which we are trying to exemplify dialectic into the logos, well, especially

01:31.680 --> 01:36.040
the logos, and the Socratic orientation.

01:36.040 --> 01:43.920
And we are also trying to bring this discussion about the logos within the logos from both

01:43.920 --> 01:49.600
the Socratic-Platonic perspective and the Christian perspective by putting Socrates and

01:49.600 --> 01:52.000
Cryptoguard into deep dialogue.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.120
And last time we had, I thought, well, I think it really caught fire, and for me of the three

01:58.120 --> 02:06.080
we've done so far, that one was the most dialogical, and the logos was there.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.840
It was in the other two, but almost completely last time, and you're nodding in agreement.

02:10.840 --> 02:17.360
And it was around, I think, a very important reflection about irony and paradox and following

02:17.360 --> 02:18.760
the logos.

02:18.760 --> 02:26.280
And so, Chris is back, and he is going to take us into something that follows on that,

02:26.280 --> 02:31.800
that he's something he really wants to bring into this conversation, and I think it's really

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
opportune.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
So, Chris, welcome.

02:33.800 --> 02:34.800
All right.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.800
Thanks, John.

02:36.800 --> 02:43.600
So we've talked a lot about irony, and we've made side-long gestures back and forth to

02:43.600 --> 02:47.960
humor quite a lot when we've been talking about Socrates and Cryptoguard.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.920
Both of them are very funny.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.240
Whatever else they are, they're very, very funny.

02:53.240 --> 02:58.680
The role of humor in Philea Sophia, I think, is very underappreciated.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.240
It's not an accessory.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.760
It's not an affectation.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.200
There's some necessity about it.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.000
There's something actually important.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
There's something we needed.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.680
Yeah, this is a point that Anderson Todd has made to me previously as well, so please

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
be careful.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
Right.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
Right.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
Yeah.

03:14.680 --> 03:19.840
And so, I have with me, this is a really great book, my dear friend Patrick Kelly put

03:19.840 --> 03:22.040
me onto this, The Humor of Cryptoguard.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.040
It's an anthology.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.320
It's edited by Thomas Oden.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.760
It's basically like a compendium, a compilation.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.560
You show the audience.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.960
The Humor of Cryptoguard.

03:30.960 --> 03:37.520
And it's basically a compilation of excerpts from Cryptoguard's body of work that, at least

03:37.520 --> 03:40.320
in the estimation of Thomas Oden, are funny.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.440
Either are about humor.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.600
Most of them aren't about humor.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.680
Most of them are just funny because he's very funny.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.920
And in his irony, he's very funny because he's often indirect.

03:49.920 --> 03:56.040
He makes very clever veiled references.

03:56.040 --> 04:01.520
One of the reasons that he was such a find, he was such a fine polemicist, is polemicist

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
the term?

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
I think that's right.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.520
Polemicist.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.720
One of the reasons he was such a fine polemicist is that he was, in fact, some people have

04:07.720 --> 04:13.560
remarked about him that his writing actually reached its absolute pinnacle when he was

04:13.560 --> 04:22.360
immersed in a polemic and when he was trying to undress his opponent.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.200
He was really quite, he had a wicked sense of humor and an ironical one at that.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.360
And anyway, so I wanted to read something I think is quite apropos.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.160
It's more, I think, insightful than it is funny, but you see the traces of the humor

04:35.160 --> 04:36.160
too.

04:36.160 --> 04:40.320
And it has, we've been talking about this idea of following the logos, how Cryptoguard

04:40.320 --> 04:41.360
takes up the task.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.080
He takes it up with a slightly different focus in his crosshairs.

04:45.080 --> 04:51.200
But fundamentally, he takes up the task of following the logos from Socrates.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.520
Right road, wrong direction, that's the title given to this excerpt.

04:54.520 --> 04:59.840
And the question given to it by the editor is, does it represent a bold advance in the

04:59.840 --> 05:03.160
spirit to master arguments for the existence of God?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.280
It's like, oh God, God's existence.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.360
What are we talking about?

05:08.360 --> 05:14.320
Any qualification that claims to render the God directly knowable is undoubtedly a milestone.

05:14.320 --> 05:21.160
But a milestone on the way of approximation, registering a retrogression rather than progress.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.840
It marks a movement away from the paradox, not toward it, missing the point of Socrates

05:26.840 --> 05:29.240
and Socratic ignorance.

05:29.240 --> 05:34.440
Close attention should be paid to this, lest the same thing happen in the spiritual world

05:34.440 --> 05:39.480
that happened to the traveler who asked an Englishman if the road led to London and was

05:39.480 --> 05:41.800
told, yes it does.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.000
But he never did arrive in London because the Englishman had omitted to mention that he

05:46.000 --> 05:51.120
needed to turn about in as much as he was going away from London.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.680
The metanoia, the right turning around, the reorientation.

05:55.680 --> 06:02.160
I want to share a parable, and I think it's the right word because it's a story that undermines

06:02.160 --> 06:08.520
itself as a narrative, by Kierkegaard, and I think it's telling that there's very few

06:08.520 --> 06:16.560
people, Plato's clearly one, Jesus of Nazareth is the maestro of the parable, but Kierkegaard

06:16.560 --> 06:18.640
is capable of the parable.

06:18.640 --> 06:25.160
He tells this story about a bunch of geese that file into a beautiful building and sing

06:25.160 --> 06:30.920
and sing about flying, but they've walked in, they sing and sing about flying, and then

06:30.920 --> 06:32.560
they walk out and go home.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.560
That's vintage.

06:39.560 --> 06:40.920
That's vintage Kierkegaard.

06:40.920 --> 06:47.560
And it's geese, and of course there's all kinds of stuff about geese.

06:48.480 --> 06:55.920
You get this amazing, like the irony is coming through and the humor is coming through, and

06:55.920 --> 06:59.720
you can see how that's part of his critique of Christendom, right?

06:59.720 --> 07:07.240
The birds singing about flight who never ever take flight, yes.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.480
And you laughed, which is the proper response.

07:10.480 --> 07:16.920
So I think it's very important that we explore this.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.440
First of all, there's a deep connection, like there's a continuum even I would propose

07:21.440 --> 07:29.480
between, and Nago says the same, in his seminal essay, The Absurd, between humor and The Absurd.

07:29.480 --> 07:36.000
And of course, Monty Python was excellent at really walking the place where they overlap.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.960
So I just watched the scene again about the Trial of the Witch.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.960
Oh, it's great.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
Which is...

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
I'm duck.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
I just always...

07:43.960 --> 07:44.960
Who are you?

07:44.960 --> 07:48.440
I'm so wise in the ways of science and all that wonderful stuff.

07:48.440 --> 08:01.640
And so it's important because there's a sense in which a refusal to incorporate humor into

08:01.640 --> 08:08.960
the following of the logos as a spiritual orientation actually innervates us with an

08:08.960 --> 08:14.240
ability to have a human transcendence with respect to The Absurd.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.320
That's a proposal I'm offering.

08:16.320 --> 08:22.240
So first of all, and I talked about this in Awakening from the Meeting Crisis, but Nago's

08:22.240 --> 08:26.280
beautiful article, at least the first half of it, where he's talking about absurdity,

08:26.280 --> 08:33.960
and he says, we give all of these arguments that are supposed to both justify and generate

08:33.960 --> 08:35.480
our sense of absurdity.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.480
But he takes each one of the arguments and he demolishes them.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.480
They don't actually...

08:40.480 --> 08:44.880
Well, what you're doing won't matter a million years from now, but that's symmetrical.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.960
What people are thinking a million years from now shouldn't matter to you.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
Exactly.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.960
Exactly.

08:49.960 --> 08:50.960
I'm so small.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.280
Well, if I made you really, really big, would you somehow find the life more meaningful?

08:54.280 --> 08:55.280
No.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.280
Right?

08:56.280 --> 09:00.520
And he says, okay, so the arguments are after the fact.

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
And then he goes into...

09:01.520 --> 09:03.720
And he gives an example that's humorous.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.680
I think you remember it, right?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
So there's this...

09:06.680 --> 09:07.680
And this is...

09:07.680 --> 09:08.680
Is it the call?

09:08.680 --> 09:09.680
The phone call?

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.680
From the dark before times, before we had smartphones.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.680
Yeah.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.680
Right?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.560
And we actually had physical phones and we had these archaic devices called voice recorders

09:17.560 --> 09:19.120
so people could leave you a message.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.120
A what?

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

09:21.120 --> 09:28.240
And so it goes like this, there's this fellow, he's summoned up his courage to call this

09:28.240 --> 09:33.360
woman he loves, let's say Susan, and it's almost like a Bob Newhart routine.

09:33.360 --> 09:36.240
And he, like, Susan, hello, don't say anything.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.240
Right?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.480
I just, I have to tell you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

09:39.480 --> 09:43.800
And then he hears, Susan is not here right now, and you laugh, right?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.320
And then Nalisa says, why is that funny?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
And it's because we've got two...

09:48.320 --> 09:56.040
And this is the thing you were saying that was like stepping into the traffic and I do

09:56.040 --> 09:57.880
start going into the...

09:57.880 --> 09:59.200
Getting running over by the carriage.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
Right, right.

10:00.680 --> 10:08.840
Because what you have is from that guy's perspective, right, everything he's doing is so rich with

10:08.840 --> 10:13.880
meaning and he's in the first person perspective and he's trying to set up an I-Thout relationship.

10:13.880 --> 10:19.280
And then the machine suddenly introduces the impersonal third person perspective that takes

10:19.280 --> 10:21.080
all of that away.

10:21.080 --> 10:27.840
And we're reminded that we have these two perspectives and they can be juxtaposed in

10:27.840 --> 10:31.680
a way in which one undermines the other.

10:31.680 --> 10:38.040
Now what's interesting is, of course, he uses that example and it's humorous.

10:38.040 --> 10:44.680
When I use that example in class, I first just tell it like that and everybody laughs.

10:44.680 --> 10:49.800
But then sometimes what I'll do is I'll go back and I'll get in, yeah, but really think,

10:49.800 --> 10:52.920
I don't know what to say, but then I'll say it's John, right?

10:52.920 --> 10:55.600
John went home and really reflected on that.

10:55.600 --> 11:00.680
But all of these moments that are so first person perspective meaningful to him are in

11:00.680 --> 11:06.400
this third person perspective and then you can see their faces change into, oh my gosh,

11:06.400 --> 11:10.920
I've woken up at 3 a.m. and wondered, does this all mean anything?

11:10.920 --> 11:17.920
And then they feel the family resemblance proximity between humor and absurdity because

11:17.920 --> 11:23.920
both of them, and this is really important, both of them involve perspectival clash.

11:23.920 --> 11:29.720
But here's a proposal I have for you and this is why we should talk about the two in relation.

11:29.720 --> 11:38.200
I think humor involves perspectival clash that we resolve with a kind of insight.

11:38.200 --> 11:46.760
I think absurdity involves a perspectival clash that drops us into participatory paradox

11:46.760 --> 11:51.360
where our existence is fundamentally called into question.

11:51.360 --> 11:57.080
And then I think the response there is something that, again, can overlap with humor, but it's

11:57.080 --> 11:58.080
different.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.680
I think the response there, the proper response is wonder, the proper response is to call

12:01.680 --> 12:06.120
both your world and yourself into deep question, right?

12:06.120 --> 12:14.680
And so I put it to you that I think that humor bears the same relationship to the absurd that

12:14.680 --> 12:22.120
irony does to the paradox in the sense not of being one-to-one maps, but one is on the

12:22.120 --> 12:26.320
same continuum and affords us and prepares us.

12:26.320 --> 12:34.560
So if we do not develop the capacity of humor, of bringing perspectives, notice how I'm emphasizing

12:34.560 --> 12:39.040
perspectival and participatory knowing, if we can't bring them into this and then look

12:39.120 --> 12:48.560
for an insight in humor, then we are not properly educated, adduced to when we confront the

12:48.560 --> 12:55.760
absurdity, not having a propositional, not even having a fully perspectival insight, but

12:55.760 --> 13:01.800
something that requires a fundamental restructuring of our being, a metanoia, right?

13:01.800 --> 13:07.720
So the humor prepares us within perspectival transformation for a perspectival participatory

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
transformation.

13:09.720 --> 13:10.720
Exactly.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.720
That's my proposal.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.720
Yes.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.720
Okay.

13:13.720 --> 13:19.080
I think that the proposal, at least, I think I'm in total agreement, at least with the

13:19.080 --> 13:20.080
gist of it.

13:20.080 --> 13:25.840
I think that we can talk about exactly what the relationship is between irony and humor.

13:25.840 --> 13:30.200
I think that the idea that irony, I think what you said as humor is to the absurd, what irony

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
is to paradox.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
Right.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.800
But I wasn't trying to draw an equivalence between irony and humor.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
Right.

13:37.680 --> 13:42.400
The proportion, the developmental relationship was all I'm drawing into the analogy.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
Yeah.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
Yeah.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.840
And so I think that the crux of the move you're making is exactly right and very kick-a-guardian.

13:49.840 --> 13:56.360
That humor is a kind of intercategorical response that changes and reorders our fundamental

13:56.360 --> 13:59.440
stance in relation to the absurdity of existence.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.440
Right.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.440
Right.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.040
And I think that's what you said in so many words.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.040
Yes.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.040
Yes.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.040
Yes.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Humor does that.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.080
No.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.000
But the humor that takes us forward is wonder.

14:10.000 --> 14:17.240
The humor that begins in irony, not all humor begins in irony, but some humor begins in irony.

14:17.240 --> 14:22.180
The irony that begins with the vis-à-vis of those two perspectives, when they see one

14:22.180 --> 14:26.240
another and are aghast at one another.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.240
That irony, that particular kind that turns into humor is the kind that we're talking

14:31.240 --> 14:36.460
about, which is the preparation for, which is the receptivity to paradox and the assumption

14:36.460 --> 14:40.920
of the paradox happens through humor.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.680
We're going to have to do a little bit of qualification about what humor, what we actually

14:44.680 --> 14:45.680
mean by this.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.680
Yes.

14:46.680 --> 14:47.680
Yeah.

14:47.680 --> 14:48.680
Yeah.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.680
Yeah.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.680
Yeah.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.680
Yeah.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.680
Because you're right.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
There are different kinds of humor.

14:53.680 --> 14:54.680
Yes.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.960
And also, people kind of think of humor as just like, you know, just like when we talk about

14:57.960 --> 15:04.320
irony, we're not talking about a kind of social affectation.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.600
We're not talking about a temperamental accessory.

15:07.600 --> 15:12.880
We're not talking about a reaction spontaneously to a situation, although cultivated irony can

15:12.880 --> 15:18.640
produce ironic reactions just as cultivated humor can produce moments of humor.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.320
But we're talking about a fundamental attitude.

15:21.320 --> 15:26.320
We're talking about a cultivated way of being, a life view, a way of understanding and making

15:26.320 --> 15:33.540
sense of the world, a way of ordering, a kind of meta-meaningful way of putting things

15:33.540 --> 15:35.840
into right arrangement.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.280
And we're not talking about that on a propositional level.

15:38.280 --> 15:43.280
We're talking about a posture in response to the absurdity of life.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.600
So when we're talking about humor, we don't just mean, I laugh at something that's funny.

15:48.600 --> 15:54.080
We're talking about an attitude that we carry into a situation, not simply something that

15:54.080 --> 15:59.080
we're foist with as a spontaneous moment of reacting.

15:59.080 --> 16:04.240
So is this like, because Highland talks about this infinitude and transcendence, the ancient

16:04.240 --> 16:14.760
sense of comedy and tragedy, where comedy is a particular way, and they're not opposites,

16:14.760 --> 16:21.040
maybe opponent processing, the aspectualizations of the absurd, where what comedy does is it

16:21.040 --> 16:26.680
makes you laugh at the absurd so we don't take ourselves too seriously, whereas tragedy

16:26.680 --> 16:31.800
makes you wonder at the absurd so we realize that we should take ourselves seriously.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
Right.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
Right.

16:33.800 --> 16:35.400
And you've got the playoff between those two.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.400
Right.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.400
Right.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.400
Exactly.

16:38.400 --> 16:44.640
So the comic actually kind of helps to almost to elasticize your relationship by being

16:44.640 --> 16:46.640
able to multi-aspectualize.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.640
Yes.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.640
Yes.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.640
Yeah.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
Yeah.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.640
Exactly.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.640
Right.

16:52.640 --> 16:53.640
Exactly.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
Exactly.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.640
Exactly.

16:55.640 --> 16:56.640
Exactly.

16:56.640 --> 16:57.640
Exactly.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.640
Exactly.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.640
Exactly.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.640
Exactly.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.640
All right.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.640
Exactly.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.640
Exactly.

17:03.640 --> 17:04.640
Exactly.

17:04.640 --> 17:05.640
In a sense.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.640
Right.

17:06.640 --> 17:07.640
That's totally what it is.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.640
That, those, those aspects shifts are at the core of insight.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
Right.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
Right.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
And of course, humor when it's cultivated well is productive of insight.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.640
Right.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.640
Right.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
Right.

17:14.640 --> 17:15.640
Right.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.640
You hear good humor.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.640
What?

17:17.640 --> 17:18.640
Sorry.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.640
The humor we're talking about, I mean, good in that sense.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.640
to what the really good joke is actually not found

17:23.640 --> 17:25.320
in the propositional content of the joke,

17:25.320 --> 17:26.960
though that too can be funny.

17:26.960 --> 17:31.960
The joke, the master ironist who is also a humorist

17:33.320 --> 17:36.520
finds the source of his humor, or her humor,

17:36.520 --> 17:40.080
as the case may be, in the way they stand

17:40.080 --> 17:42.360
in relation to the joke that they have made.

17:42.360 --> 17:46.240
It is a characterological move that they're making.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.560
Their position relative to what is uttered

17:49.560 --> 17:51.560
is actually where the humor is.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.720
It's not simply within the semantic content of the joke.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.560
That's why I did the story of the geese,

17:58.560 --> 18:00.160
because they're doing something absurd,

18:00.160 --> 18:04.480
and you get the juxtaposition,

18:04.480 --> 18:06.520
and it's like the two perspectives

18:06.520 --> 18:09.240
in the story of the person with the voice recorder,

18:09.240 --> 18:11.040
and it's funny there, but you realize,

18:11.040 --> 18:15.240
but the joke's actually on us because we often

18:15.240 --> 18:18.320
are the geese that sing about flying and never fly.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.640
Exactly, exactly.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.000
So in Kierkegaard, or Odin, I think makes a,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.560
and I can't do it justice right now,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.360
but I highly, highly recommend it,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.960
this book, The Humor of Kierkegaard.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.240
He makes an argument that goes something like this,

18:33.240 --> 18:37.280
that basically, just as irony,

18:37.280 --> 18:39.280
waking up inside the dream,

18:39.280 --> 18:42.120
waking up within the mirage of ideality

18:42.120 --> 18:44.560
that has us extend ourself infinitely,

18:44.560 --> 18:47.240
but somehow within time, right?

18:47.240 --> 18:49.040
That just as irony wakes us up

18:49.040 --> 18:50.880
within the aesthetic stage of life

18:50.880 --> 18:53.560
and prepares us for transition to the ethical,

18:53.560 --> 18:56.240
for commitment, for commitment to an either-or,

18:56.240 --> 18:58.680
instead of the impasse of either-or,

18:58.680 --> 19:02.640
because irony prepares us to live within the bounds

19:02.640 --> 19:06.520
of commitment, still somehow under the aspect of the eternal.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.120
Humor, for Odin, he makes the argument

19:10.120 --> 19:12.840
that in Kierkegaard, humor does something similar

19:12.840 --> 19:14.920
in the transition from the ethical to the religious.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.120
Oh, oh, oh.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.280
That's the move he makes.

19:17.280 --> 19:18.560
That's very, that's very good.

19:18.560 --> 19:21.400
So that irony is to the aesthetic

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
what humor is to the ethical.

19:23.600 --> 19:24.760
Right, right.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.520
A way of waking up inside of it,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.120
and realizing that it is not ultimate.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.000
Right, right, and of course,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.440
a lot of Socratic humor is that way too.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.280
And I even-

19:36.280 --> 19:37.560
You're corrupting the youth.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.160
Actually, Socrates says,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.120
I think that you should be paying before it.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.200
Yes, exactly, exactly.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.000
Right, and you're paying the apology, right?

19:44.000 --> 19:44.840
I can't remember exactly,

19:44.840 --> 19:45.680
but it's something like that.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.440
What do you think your just punishment should be?

19:48.440 --> 19:49.960
You should give me state sponsorship

19:49.960 --> 19:50.800
for the rest of my life.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.640
That's right, yeah.

19:53.520 --> 19:54.760
Right, exactly.

19:54.760 --> 19:55.920
So-

19:55.920 --> 19:56.920
No, I like this proposal.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.080
I think this is really,

19:58.080 --> 19:59.800
I just wanna make sure I'm understanding it.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.040
So irony sort of gives you

20:02.040 --> 20:04.960
the requisite cognitive flexibility

20:04.960 --> 20:09.400
to get an insight out of the aesthetic into the ethical.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.800
And then humor,

20:10.800 --> 20:13.880
at least the kind of humor we're talking about here,

20:13.920 --> 20:17.120
gives you an insight out of the ethical

20:17.120 --> 20:18.440
into the religious.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.280
That's right.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.680
But could tragedy also do that?

20:22.680 --> 20:23.840
Because what I just said,

20:23.840 --> 20:27.280
that pairing between comedy, right,

20:27.280 --> 20:28.600
in which-

20:28.600 --> 20:30.160
I don't think you have one without the other.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.000
No, no, of course.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.080
And Jonathan Miller made it famous

20:32.080 --> 20:33.680
that when you're putting on,

20:33.680 --> 20:35.240
as she experienced tragedy,

20:35.240 --> 20:36.080
you emphasize-

20:36.080 --> 20:36.920
You lean into the humor.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.760
You lean into the humor.

20:37.760 --> 20:38.600
And we do the same.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.440
And we do the same.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.280
That's right.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.120
Because they're yin-yang with each other.

20:41.120 --> 20:41.960
That's right.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.640
And good drama, good dramatists know that.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.040
In general.

20:45.040 --> 20:45.880
Because what I'm proposing is,

20:45.880 --> 20:49.640
we've got the humor telling us,

20:49.640 --> 20:52.400
don't, they're saying to the ethical person,

20:52.400 --> 20:55.120
don't take your ethical framework so-

20:55.120 --> 20:56.680
Seriously.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.520
That's right.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.720
But the tragic figure is saying,

20:59.720 --> 21:00.760
you know what?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.040
You need to take your life

21:02.040 --> 21:03.960
and your aspiration to virtue.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.200
Seriously.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.040
That's right.

21:06.040 --> 21:10.000
And there is no algorithm for resolving that.

21:10.000 --> 21:10.840
Right?

21:10.840 --> 21:11.680
It's a point of process.

21:11.680 --> 21:12.520
That's right.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.320
We were talking about this earlier.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.760
I just wanna bring it out

21:15.760 --> 21:17.880
because I think it's solely also appropriate

21:17.880 --> 21:20.480
to both Kierkegaard and Socrates

21:20.480 --> 21:23.560
because I see them both as taking on this role.

21:23.560 --> 21:27.240
So you've got somebody that's doing humor, right?

21:27.240 --> 21:30.720
And what you just said about challenging the frameworks,

21:30.720 --> 21:32.280
that's the gesture before the king.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.280
Yeah, that's right.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.120
Right?

21:34.120 --> 21:36.480
You have all this authority and all the laws,

21:36.480 --> 21:38.400
but here I am reminding you,

21:38.400 --> 21:40.560
don't take yourself too seriously.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.680
Because you are not what is ultimate.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.880
Right, but you also have the prophet.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.000
Now, I don't mean prophet in the person

21:48.000 --> 21:50.320
who tells the future, the fortune teller.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.520
I mean the biblical prophet,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.320
the person that's not foretelling,

21:53.320 --> 21:54.600
they're telling forth.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.120
They're trying to get people to see more deeply

21:57.120 --> 21:57.960
into what's happening.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.080
And you have Nathan coming before

22:00.080 --> 22:02.320
the greatest king of the Old Testament, David.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.360
And he's a prophet and he tells them this story.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.680
He tells them the story about this guy, right?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.400
Who has one sheep and there's this other guy

22:09.400 --> 22:10.240
who has all these sheep

22:10.920 --> 22:12.920
and David's outraged.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.600
And then he says, that's what you did with Bathsheba.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.800
And David goes, oh, right, right?

22:18.800 --> 22:23.800
And that's, he makes David see the tragedy

22:23.920 --> 22:25.920
of what he has done, right?

22:25.920 --> 22:30.120
And that's also something that takes you out of

22:30.120 --> 22:33.600
the ethical into, so they're both.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.120
There's the prophet and the gesture.

22:35.120 --> 22:39.200
And then here's my proposal, both Socrates

22:39.200 --> 22:41.480
and Kierkegaard are both.

22:41.480 --> 22:45.240
Yes, a hundred percent, a hundred percent.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.440
Absolutely, I couldn't agree more.

22:47.440 --> 22:50.440
So, okay, so, okay.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.320
So let's take that proposal.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.240
Let's presuppose it for a moment.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.360
And then let's talk about maybe both aspects.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.200
Totally.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.040
Discreetly.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.440
And then we'll bring them back together.

23:00.440 --> 23:01.400
Okay, okay.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.640
Because each one, right, the tragedy reminds us

23:05.640 --> 23:08.200
of transcendence while we're finite.

23:08.200 --> 23:11.360
And the humorous reminds us of the transcendence

23:11.360 --> 23:13.320
coming into the finite.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.280
That's right.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.400
That's why humor, the good humorous,

23:17.400 --> 23:19.080
one of the things that the good humorous does

23:19.080 --> 23:20.760
is show performative contradiction.

23:20.760 --> 23:21.600
Yes.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.720
The humorous actually, it's one of the ways

23:23.720 --> 23:28.400
that the humorous alerts, alerts.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.440
I just want to make clear what performative contradiction

23:32.440 --> 23:33.320
is for, right?

23:33.320 --> 23:36.020
So, and it's important because performative contradiction

23:36.020 --> 23:38.180
is something that moves us outside of the propositional.

23:38.180 --> 23:39.020
Yes.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.180
So a classic example of a performative contradiction

23:41.180 --> 23:42.460
is I am sleeping.

23:42.460 --> 23:43.300
Yes.

23:43.300 --> 23:47.140
Because that statement in so far

23:47.140 --> 23:48.860
is how it's referring objectively.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.140
Of course I sleep.

23:50.140 --> 23:51.620
But when I utter that statement,

23:51.620 --> 23:53.460
I can't be asleep in order to utter it.

23:53.460 --> 23:56.180
So there's a contradiction between the proposition

23:56.180 --> 23:57.780
and the perspectival and participant point.

23:57.780 --> 23:58.620
That's right.

23:58.620 --> 23:59.460
That's right.

23:59.460 --> 24:00.300
Good, good, good.

24:00.300 --> 24:03.500
And you see how that the performative contradiction,

24:04.500 --> 24:08.100
one of the things that it does is it de-idolizes

24:08.100 --> 24:10.900
the ethical of the religiosity

24:10.900 --> 24:13.700
with which it is often unduly invested.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.300
What I mean by that is this.

24:16.220 --> 24:20.180
It shows that we can be beholden

24:20.180 --> 24:22.100
to the custom of an ethic

24:22.100 --> 24:24.780
while at the same time depicting

24:24.780 --> 24:27.120
and coming into awareness of the fact

24:27.120 --> 24:30.660
that we do not in fact live in accordance with it.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.140
We do not live in a way that presupposes it

24:33.140 --> 24:36.180
as the highest good and index of what is true.

24:36.180 --> 24:38.220
So this is Jesus.

24:38.220 --> 24:40.300
The Sabbath was made for human beings,

24:40.300 --> 24:41.740
not human beings for the Sabbath.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.580
Right.

24:42.580 --> 24:43.580
Right, right, right, right.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.660
I'll give you my favorite example.

24:46.660 --> 24:50.460
So I had a great conversation a little while back

24:50.460 --> 24:51.660
with Sevilla King about this.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.420
My favorite current humorist

24:53.420 --> 24:55.940
who is also an ironist is Dave Chappelle.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.540
And I don't think there's anybody around

24:57.540 --> 24:58.900
that does it better than him right now.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.780
And he has this joke that I think

25:00.780 --> 25:02.020
basically sums it all up.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.860
He says at one point, one of his specials,

25:03.860 --> 25:07.420
he goes, he's talking to an audience

25:07.420 --> 25:09.780
that is, I would say politically speaking,

25:10.660 --> 25:12.980
kind of generally left leaning.

25:12.980 --> 25:16.000
As is he by all accounts, by his own admission.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.580
But he's very hard to pin down when he does a standup

25:19.580 --> 25:22.980
because he assumes different identities and perspectives.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.620
And he often leads you down a road

25:24.620 --> 25:26.380
thinking you're being set up for one thing,

25:26.380 --> 25:27.780
but the joke comes in from the left side.

25:27.780 --> 25:28.780
That's very quick of the guardian.

25:28.780 --> 25:29.980
Very.

25:29.980 --> 25:31.380
So he says at one point,

25:31.380 --> 25:33.340
he's talking about a variety of political topics

25:33.340 --> 25:35.700
and he's talking about gun control.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.100
And he just sort of shakes his head and he goes,

25:37.100 --> 25:40.500
I hate guns, I can't stand them.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.660
And of course the audience, someone cheers,

25:42.660 --> 25:43.860
yeah, no guns.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.260
And he goes, yeah, but I have several.

25:51.180 --> 25:56.180
And that to me is one of the most well-crafted jokes

25:56.980 --> 25:59.660
imaginable because what it does is,

25:59.700 --> 26:01.980
he means it when he says he doesn't like guns.

26:01.980 --> 26:02.820
He can't stand them.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.020
And he means it when he says he has several.

26:05.020 --> 26:06.460
Right, right, right.

26:06.460 --> 26:09.180
And what he's doing is he's,

26:09.180 --> 26:12.780
so he's making, now there's an obvious joke

26:12.780 --> 26:14.820
about two perspectives, right?

26:14.820 --> 26:15.940
Clashing, yes.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.900
A very obvious performative contradiction.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.820
So that's the first order of the joke is this.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.100
There's a performative contradiction,

26:21.100 --> 26:22.180
he's woken up to it, right?

26:22.180 --> 26:24.260
He goes, I am at quits with myself

26:24.260 --> 26:26.820
because I espouse an ideological position

26:26.820 --> 26:30.980
that is in accordance with a prevailing ethical framework.

26:32.260 --> 26:35.460
And it's a framework that, at least in our ethos,

26:35.460 --> 26:37.660
many people are aligned with, right?

26:37.660 --> 26:41.180
And on the one hand, he realizes that there is something

26:41.180 --> 26:43.900
about him, about the way that he lives,

26:43.900 --> 26:45.900
the way that he behaves, that there's that variance

26:45.900 --> 26:48.420
with that ethic, that he can't comport himself.

26:48.420 --> 26:53.420
He can kind of, he can stand to it, he can espouse it,

26:53.660 --> 26:56.380
but there's something in him that issues it,

26:56.580 --> 26:58.900
that eludes it, that bucks it, right?

26:58.900 --> 27:00.300
So that's one level of the joke,

27:00.300 --> 27:01.620
but the higher order of the joke,

27:01.620 --> 27:03.220
which is really the source of the joke,

27:03.220 --> 27:06.220
is that he's standing beside himself,

27:06.220 --> 27:09.660
looking at the performative contradiction going, Jesus.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.940
Yeah, yeah.

27:10.940 --> 27:14.180
And he's pointing implicitly at his audience and going,

27:14.180 --> 27:16.020
see, see, yes, yeah.

27:16.020 --> 27:16.860
See that?

27:16.860 --> 27:18.900
See that, right?

27:18.900 --> 27:20.020
Don't, do you see that?

27:20.020 --> 27:23.420
Do you see how I am quite beside myself?

27:23.420 --> 27:25.820
How I am quite not myself?

27:26.020 --> 27:27.780
How I am quite at variance with myself.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.900
Right, and these are the Christian guardian themes

27:28.900 --> 27:29.740
you've been at, versus.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.980
He is, he is the source of the joke.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.540
He is its object, right?

27:33.540 --> 27:34.660
Right, right, right.

27:34.660 --> 27:36.900
He's showing the performative contradiction,

27:36.900 --> 27:38.220
but he's turning in the direction

27:38.220 --> 27:41.020
of the performative contradiction and wondering at it.

27:41.020 --> 27:41.860
Okay, so let me, I-

27:41.860 --> 27:44.260
And finding himself in a moment of absurdity

27:44.260 --> 27:45.900
allowed before an audience.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.220
So I just want to slow this down,

27:47.220 --> 27:48.420
because this is really brilliant.

27:48.420 --> 27:51.420
So he does this first move, which is,

27:51.420 --> 27:52.940
as you properly described it,

27:52.980 --> 27:56.900
how humor gets you to undermine, right,

27:56.900 --> 28:00.300
the sort of self-righteous absolutism

28:00.300 --> 28:02.620
of a particular ethical framework.

28:02.620 --> 28:06.380
But then, you can't then defer to him as the authority

28:06.380 --> 28:08.260
that is now going to be made sacred,

28:08.260 --> 28:10.460
because he's also in the performative contradiction

28:10.460 --> 28:11.820
undermining himself.

28:12.660 --> 28:14.500
Oh, that's very good, that's very good, that's very good.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.020
Right, he does something very similar.

28:17.020 --> 28:20.460
He has a joke, he picks these remarkably contentious topics.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.620
He has a joke about, he talks about abortion, right,

28:23.620 --> 28:25.300
and then immediately gets an audience

28:25.300 --> 28:26.980
on the edge of its seat, right?

28:26.980 --> 28:28.260
Yeah, they're really a, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:28.260 --> 28:29.620
Even someone who's watching this right now is like,

28:29.620 --> 28:32.820
oh God, what's he about to say?

28:32.820 --> 28:36.420
And he says, and he goes, he stops it again,

28:36.420 --> 28:38.460
he's talking to a relatively left-leaning audience.

28:38.460 --> 28:39.740
And he looks at the audience and he goes,

28:39.740 --> 28:42.900
I gotta tell you, I'm not for abortion.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.340
There's maybe two people clapping.

28:46.340 --> 28:50.420
And he goes, I'm not for it, and I'm not against it either.

28:50.420 --> 28:54.420
It all depends on who I get pregnant, right?

28:57.940 --> 28:59.580
The same thing is happening there.

28:59.580 --> 29:01.940
The exact same dynamic is happening, right?

29:02.940 --> 29:06.180
And then he takes it even further,

29:06.180 --> 29:11.180
and he says, and he takes up this,

29:11.900 --> 29:15.980
he sort of takes up a kind of a caricature

29:16.020 --> 29:18.140
of a moralizing persona, and he says,

29:18.140 --> 29:21.100
I honestly believe, and I think he means it,

29:21.100 --> 29:24.140
I honestly believe that I believe

29:24.140 --> 29:26.100
in a woman's right to choose,

29:26.100 --> 29:29.300
and I believe that right is unequivocal and unquestionable,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.540
and she should not have to consult anybody

29:31.540 --> 29:34.460
except for a physician as to how she applies that right.

29:34.460 --> 29:37.940
Gentlemen, that is fair, it's their choice.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.860
And then he says, and ladies, to be fair to us,

29:40.860 --> 29:43.260
I also think that if you choose to have the baby,

29:43.260 --> 29:45.540
the man should not have to penny.

29:45.540 --> 29:48.740
If you can kill this kid, I can at least abandon him.

29:52.660 --> 29:57.060
Now, imagine the blood rushing to the face

29:57.060 --> 29:58.380
adhering to something like that,

29:58.380 --> 29:59.420
but the fact of the matter is-

29:59.420 --> 30:00.260
So what does the audience do?

30:00.260 --> 30:03.060
Do they laugh, or what do they do in that situation?

30:03.060 --> 30:05.940
Well, are they laughing nervously?

30:05.940 --> 30:08.860
Yes, I think so, I can't remember exactly,

30:08.860 --> 30:10.820
but they're definitely laughing.

30:10.820 --> 30:15.060
There's a little bit of, there's an intake of breath,

30:15.060 --> 30:18.220
there's a nervous laughter, there's a mixed reaction,

30:18.220 --> 30:19.300
but it's very uproarious.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.620
So I wanna get this, first of all, he calls this up,

30:21.620 --> 30:23.140
and everybody sees their commitment,

30:23.140 --> 30:25.780
and then he calls out a contradiction, right?

30:25.780 --> 30:28.660
And then he's also placed himself, right,

30:28.660 --> 30:31.420
that this isn't an abstract thing, it involves me,

30:31.420 --> 30:33.980
and I'll be egocentric when it involves me.

30:33.980 --> 30:34.980
Exactly.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.540
And he's got all this going, and you're going, wow.

30:37.540 --> 30:40.700
So first of all, he is making us aware

30:40.700 --> 30:43.580
of all of these different perspectival clashes,

30:43.580 --> 30:45.860
and how there's a complexity there

30:45.860 --> 30:49.700
that we are, in many instances, trying to avoid.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.500
That's right, and what he's showing is that

30:52.500 --> 30:54.700
this doesn't make sense, like when we put these pieces

30:54.700 --> 30:56.380
together, they don't fit.

30:56.380 --> 30:57.700
Don't, do you see everybody?

30:57.700 --> 30:59.460
I'm putting all the pieces together,

30:59.460 --> 31:01.220
I'm fitting the perspectives, I'm putting them

31:01.220 --> 31:02.660
face to face, and they don't agree,

31:02.660 --> 31:05.460
and they don't make for a coherent life view.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.620
That means that something about the way

31:07.620 --> 31:11.060
that we've, I'm editorializing him a little bit,

31:11.060 --> 31:13.740
and that in some ways I shouldn't even be doing this much.

31:13.740 --> 31:16.260
But for the sake of explanation, I think,

31:16.260 --> 31:17.700
what he's doing is something like this,

31:17.700 --> 31:21.060
is like he's putting all of these perspectives together,

31:21.060 --> 31:22.980
and he's gathering them into this,

31:22.980 --> 31:26.780
he's trying to squish them into the ethical frame

31:26.780 --> 31:30.060
that we have decided to use as a way of arbitrating

31:30.060 --> 31:31.780
the norm, and it doesn't all fit together,

31:31.780 --> 31:33.700
and he's going, look everyone,

31:33.700 --> 31:35.820
we are full of performative contradictions

31:35.820 --> 31:40.820
when we try to absolutize this ethical framework.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.420
And it doesn't fit, so something is missing.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.860
And that removes our capacity for empathy

31:46.860 --> 31:51.380
and understanding of people who have ethical position

31:51.380 --> 31:52.620
other than ours.

31:52.620 --> 31:57.620
Like if we fail to grasp the humility of our humanity

31:57.940 --> 32:00.500
that we are caught up in performative contradictions,

32:00.500 --> 32:04.260
it is very easy for us to defy our side

32:04.260 --> 32:06.100
and demonize the other side.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.380
Right, right, right.

32:07.380 --> 32:09.700
Which of course undermines what ethics

32:09.700 --> 32:11.060
is supposed to be doing.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.220
Right, of course it's.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.900
That's a huge performative contradiction

32:13.900 --> 32:14.740
of the entire frame.

32:14.740 --> 32:15.580
Huge, huge.

32:15.580 --> 32:19.700
Okay, so that's just to kind of tie that back in.

32:19.700 --> 32:23.460
Essentially what the ironic humorist

32:23.460 --> 32:26.060
who can pit perspectival frames against one another

32:26.060 --> 32:29.780
and fit them under the same overall marquee of normativity

32:29.780 --> 32:32.140
that is espoused by a particular culture

32:32.140 --> 32:36.580
does so to reveal how when you actually frame it properly,

32:36.580 --> 32:40.780
when you try and step back and see it

32:40.780 --> 32:42.660
in any kind of final way.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.140
And if you try and see through that.

32:45.140 --> 32:46.460
Ironically.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.500
That's beautiful.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.500
When you try and look at your ethical frame,

32:49.500 --> 32:52.460
unironically it results in an aporia.

32:52.460 --> 32:55.420
It becomes absurd because it does not fit together.

32:55.420 --> 32:58.660
He's opening up exposure to the absurdity

32:58.660 --> 33:03.140
within the ethical and in so doing gestures outside of it.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.300
Right, and so what you're saying is

33:05.340 --> 33:08.060
both Kierkegaard and Socrates are doing this.

33:08.060 --> 33:10.100
And so I'm thinking of when Socrates is talking

33:10.100 --> 33:12.580
to Euthyphro who knows what all what,

33:12.580 --> 33:14.300
he knows what piety is.

33:14.300 --> 33:17.860
And he's about to prosecute his father for being impious.

33:17.860 --> 33:20.540
Right, and then Socrates says the famous,

33:20.540 --> 33:21.660
well, what, right, right.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.340
First of all, he gets from Euthyphro.

33:23.340 --> 33:24.180
Well, what is it?

33:24.180 --> 33:26.020
Well, it's to do what the gods tell us.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.940
Well, do the gods tell us to do something

33:27.940 --> 33:29.420
because it's good?

33:29.420 --> 33:31.700
Or is it good because the gods do it?

33:31.700 --> 33:33.900
And Euthyphro wants it both ways

33:33.900 --> 33:36.300
because either way undermines his position,

33:36.300 --> 33:38.300
puts him into performative contradiction,

33:38.300 --> 33:39.940
and he realizes, and so what does he do?

33:39.940 --> 33:42.180
He literally runs away from Socrates.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.780
Right, yeah, yeah, right.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.780
That's right, and you know what?

33:45.780 --> 33:48.420
That's what people often do in face of the humorous.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.780
They turn and they run.

33:49.780 --> 33:51.140
But here's the thing.

33:51.140 --> 33:54.300
Put all that, there's all that humor,

33:54.300 --> 33:55.900
but where's Socrates going?

33:55.900 --> 33:58.300
He's going to the courtroom to face his charges

33:58.300 --> 33:59.500
that are gonna lead to his death.

33:59.500 --> 34:03.660
Yes, yes, yes.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.420
There's the humorous and the tragedy.

34:05.420 --> 34:06.260
And the tragedy.

34:06.260 --> 34:07.100
Bound up together.

34:07.100 --> 34:07.940
Unfolded together.

34:07.940 --> 34:08.780
Yeah.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.380
And you really can't, because they are simply

34:10.380 --> 34:13.500
as specializations of the same condition of existence

34:13.500 --> 34:18.060
that has us fraught with the contradiction of our humanness,

34:18.060 --> 34:20.780
that you can't have one without the other, right?

34:20.780 --> 34:22.820
So this makes me think again,

34:22.820 --> 34:24.660
of dialectic into Deologos

34:24.660 --> 34:26.660
and when people are doing the practice.

34:27.860 --> 34:32.500
Like, there's two ways in which it can go wrong.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.380
We can get so serious

34:35.380 --> 34:39.460
that we start to choke the flow of insight

34:39.460 --> 34:42.420
that is the life breath of a Logos.

34:42.420 --> 34:46.980
But we can also fail by not taking it seriously enough

34:46.980 --> 34:50.500
so we do not put ourselves at stake in the practice.

34:50.500 --> 34:55.500
So we need both the prophetic and the gesture, right?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.420
The prophet and the comedian, right?

34:58.420 --> 34:59.700
Both have to be,

34:59.700 --> 35:02.940
we have to be constantly toggling between them

35:02.940 --> 35:04.980
as we participate in the practice

35:04.980 --> 35:07.100
because we can fail.

35:07.100 --> 35:10.220
This is Aristotle's classic idea

35:10.220 --> 35:13.700
about how you do the virtual engineering of a virtue.

35:13.700 --> 35:17.900
You have constraints that limit and constraints that afford

35:17.900 --> 35:20.980
because we're always moving between deficit and access.

35:20.980 --> 35:22.820
We can take ourselves too seriously

35:22.820 --> 35:26.380
and we can fail to take ourselves seriously enough.

35:26.380 --> 35:28.540
And when we put the two together

35:28.540 --> 35:31.380
in the practice of dialectic, we can get again,

35:31.380 --> 35:35.860
this is yet another way of how we can lean into

35:35.860 --> 35:38.660
and start to take up the orientation

35:38.660 --> 35:40.260
of finite transcendence

35:40.260 --> 35:45.060
that really is the place that gives birth to the Logos.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.460
That's right, well said, well said.

35:48.460 --> 35:51.020
And when we undertake that practice

35:51.020 --> 35:53.460
to remain sufficiently mobile

35:53.460 --> 35:55.980
to be able to migrate our perspective properly.

35:55.980 --> 35:58.340
And also to develop the kind of,

35:59.860 --> 36:01.540
to develop the kind of,

36:02.420 --> 36:04.860
to socialize the process properly, right?

36:04.860 --> 36:07.300
That's another function that the humor has, right?

36:07.300 --> 36:08.620
Of course, of course.

36:08.620 --> 36:12.380
Is that it helps establish the relation, right?

36:12.380 --> 36:15.380
Right, because you can't tell a joke on your own.

36:15.380 --> 36:16.940
A joke is inherently,

36:16.940 --> 36:19.460
humor is inherently multi-perspectival,

36:19.460 --> 36:21.700
multi-espectual and dialogical.

36:21.700 --> 36:24.260
Same thing with tragedy, right?

36:24.260 --> 36:27.620
So now, here, again, like I did last time,

36:27.620 --> 36:30.020
I wanna do this sort of semi-provocative thing with you

36:30.020 --> 36:32.700
because I can deeply trust you, right?

36:32.700 --> 36:35.700
Cryptoguard, to me, is great evidence

36:35.700 --> 36:38.380
of the capacity to bring humor and tragedy

36:39.580 --> 36:44.580
like into a disclosure of how one can see the world,

36:45.340 --> 36:47.340
the way Christ, the way Jesus did.

36:47.340 --> 36:48.820
I'll use my language if that's okay.

36:48.820 --> 36:49.740
There, right.

36:51.580 --> 36:54.060
And we see humor clearly in Socrates.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.060
We see it clearly in Cryptoguard.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.020
We see it clearly, right?

36:58.020 --> 37:01.100
In many great sages,

37:01.100 --> 37:03.340
like Shwangza from the Taoist tradition

37:03.340 --> 37:05.780
is this humor after humor after.

37:05.780 --> 37:08.820
I don't see it in the Bible, in the New Testament.

37:08.820 --> 37:10.580
We were talking about this the other day.

37:10.580 --> 37:12.500
We were, and that's interesting.

37:14.420 --> 37:19.420
Because we have an overwhelming presentation of the tragic

37:19.420 --> 37:21.540
in the sense we've been talking about here, right?

37:21.540 --> 37:22.900
It's, right?

37:22.900 --> 37:27.300
And we also get presentation of human beings being foolish,

37:27.300 --> 37:31.020
but it's not, but it's always filled with pathos.

37:31.020 --> 37:31.860
That's true.

37:31.860 --> 37:34.620
That might be true on its own terms,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.140
although it puts me in mind, again,

37:37.140 --> 37:39.220
of some of Kirkegaard's thoughts on the topic

37:39.220 --> 37:42.980
because one of the things that he takes pains to point out,

37:42.980 --> 37:44.900
and that Odin does a good job of pointing out,

37:44.900 --> 37:49.460
is that he understands the incarnation

37:49.460 --> 37:52.660
as being something remarkably comic, right?

37:52.660 --> 37:53.500
Really?

37:53.500 --> 37:54.340
Yes.

37:54.340 --> 37:55.180
Yes.

37:55.180 --> 37:56.340
Oh, you're gonna have to unpack that for me,

37:56.340 --> 37:59.260
because like the sort of green shadow

37:59.260 --> 38:01.340
of my Christian sensibility, right?

38:02.340 --> 38:04.700
It's like getting irked, and it's like,

38:04.700 --> 38:06.420
I'm even surprised in this moment right now

38:06.420 --> 38:07.580
that I'm getting irked by that,

38:07.580 --> 38:08.740
because like, what's going on in me?

38:08.740 --> 38:09.500
But anyways.

38:09.500 --> 38:12.540
Well, I know, and it's a kind of calculated,

38:12.540 --> 38:16.180
Socratic heresy, for him, it's no such heresy, right?

38:16.180 --> 38:19.860
Because for him, humor is, humor is in some sense,

38:19.860 --> 38:22.460
the birth canal towards the serious and the religious,

38:22.460 --> 38:24.380
to use your language from yesterday, right?

38:24.380 --> 38:25.540
The canal.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.940
I mean, think for a moment of,

38:27.940 --> 38:30.100
in the same way that,

38:30.100 --> 38:31.940
you know what makes me think there's that old like,

38:31.940 --> 38:33.780
fable about Phaelies that, you know,

38:33.780 --> 38:35.020
he's gazing up, right?

38:35.020 --> 38:36.260
One of the earliest philosophers,

38:36.260 --> 38:37.540
he's looking up at the sky.

38:37.540 --> 38:38.380
The stars and he falls into the well.

38:38.380 --> 38:39.460
And he's beholden into the well.

38:39.460 --> 38:40.300
Yeah, and he falls into the well.

38:40.300 --> 38:41.860
It's something very much like that, right?

38:41.860 --> 38:43.580
Or Heraclitus.

38:43.580 --> 38:44.540
Did you know how he dies?

38:44.540 --> 38:46.460
Oh, buried in a horse manure.

38:46.460 --> 38:47.300
Horse manure.

38:48.300 --> 38:49.140
Right.

38:49.420 --> 38:50.700
Right, yeah.

38:50.700 --> 38:53.060
So you have this,

38:53.060 --> 38:56.260
you have the impregnation of the finite by the infinite.

38:56.260 --> 38:58.140
Okay, so you have something like that.

38:58.140 --> 38:59.980
And for Kierkegaard,

38:59.980 --> 39:03.780
the fact of the Son of God being born into a stable

39:03.780 --> 39:05.540
in the lowliest of conditions

39:05.540 --> 39:07.900
and the most impoverished of settings,

39:07.900 --> 39:09.860
isn't simply paradoxical.

39:09.860 --> 39:11.140
I mean, it is.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.420
But the attitude that accompanies the paradox,

39:14.420 --> 39:17.620
the affective manner of that paradox for him

39:17.620 --> 39:19.540
is the comic, right?

39:19.540 --> 39:20.380
So how do you get,

39:20.380 --> 39:21.700
so, okay, this is,

39:21.700 --> 39:23.100
I wanna really slow down on this

39:23.100 --> 39:26.300
because you're really intriguing me with this.

39:26.300 --> 39:30.900
So I get the paradoxical and how even the tragic

39:30.900 --> 39:35.180
are so such perfect vehicles for the numinous.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.020
Yes.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.540
And of course, many people,

39:37.540 --> 39:39.100
I do this, you know,

39:39.100 --> 39:40.300
I don't consider myself a Christian,

39:40.300 --> 39:41.300
but at Christmas time,

39:41.300 --> 39:44.300
I insist on there being a nativity seen put up

39:44.300 --> 39:49.220
because there's something numinous going on, right?

39:49.220 --> 39:51.580
And so, like I say,

39:51.580 --> 39:55.540
and, you know, auto, the fascinating and the tremendous.

39:55.540 --> 39:58.020
And so the tragedy and the tremendous

39:58.020 --> 40:00.620
go well together, the fascinating, right?

40:00.620 --> 40:03.140
How does, how would the,

40:03.140 --> 40:04.140
do you see what I'm trying to get at?

40:04.140 --> 40:05.460
How would you,

40:05.460 --> 40:07.860
how did the comic and the numinous come together?

40:09.140 --> 40:12.620
Well, one of the things that the comic does, I think,

40:12.620 --> 40:16.220
think of this physiologically for a second, right?

40:16.220 --> 40:17.380
Like we're talking about humor

40:17.380 --> 40:18.940
as though it's this sort of abstract thing,

40:18.940 --> 40:20.340
but think of it like viscerally.

40:20.340 --> 40:22.420
Think of what happens affectively, right?

40:22.420 --> 40:25.180
Think of what happens when something strikes you as comic

40:25.180 --> 40:26.140
and you will laugh

40:26.140 --> 40:28.580
and you'll get that sensation in your body.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.660
It is a way of,

40:30.660 --> 40:35.260
I think what it does is it disrupts your categorical thinking

40:35.260 --> 40:37.740
by re-disposing the attitude you take

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
in the face of something that on its face,

40:39.740 --> 40:42.300
one taken literally doesn't add up.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.060
But one thing that humor does is I think

40:44.060 --> 40:46.500
it softens our attention, right?

40:46.500 --> 40:48.780
It's a certain form of sensitization.

40:48.780 --> 40:53.020
And I think in the case of this biblical example,

40:53.020 --> 40:56.060
I think what it does is it helps to inoculate

40:56.060 --> 41:00.100
the literalism that would accompany

41:00.100 --> 41:02.860
the self-seriousness taken towards such a thing.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.220
Oh, okay, okay, I wanna savor this.

41:04.220 --> 41:05.300
I wanna savor this, this is good.

41:05.300 --> 41:09.820
So the idea is if we only look at it one way,

41:09.860 --> 41:12.420
there's a tremendous temptation to literalism

41:12.420 --> 41:14.060
and a kind of fundamentalism,

41:14.060 --> 41:17.060
which of course is anathema to all of this stuff

41:17.060 --> 41:17.900
we've been talking about.

41:17.900 --> 41:18.740
Anathema to everything.

41:18.740 --> 41:19.580
Yeah, yeah, okay.

41:19.580 --> 41:22.940
And so what you're doing is to remember the comic

41:22.940 --> 41:26.020
means you don't take the literal presentation.

41:26.020 --> 41:29.020
So seriously, so it's like the way the parables

41:29.020 --> 41:30.820
undermined the narrative framework.

41:30.820 --> 41:35.100
Right, right, so that they don't calcify the perspective.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.940
Okay, so excellent, excellent.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.620
While you were saying that something else came to mind

41:40.620 --> 41:42.460
and I wanna see if they go together,

41:42.460 --> 41:45.660
I was realizing, oh, but John,

41:45.660 --> 41:47.780
you have been so inculturated to regard laughter

41:47.780 --> 41:49.780
as always ridicule.

41:49.780 --> 41:53.860
But the moments in which I have really laughed

41:53.860 --> 41:56.500
have not been moments of ridicule.

41:56.500 --> 41:59.140
They have been moments of joy.

41:59.140 --> 42:03.940
So I grew up in Dundas and I was going to a school,

42:03.940 --> 42:06.620
high school, and I had a really close friend.

42:07.540 --> 42:11.020
And one day after school, we were in a room

42:11.020 --> 42:15.700
and I said, what's that on your shelf there?

42:15.700 --> 42:17.740
And he said, well, there's a game we can play.

42:17.740 --> 42:18.860
And so I said, well, let's play it.

42:18.860 --> 42:19.820
He said, okay, and then we get it out

42:19.820 --> 42:22.220
and there were colored spheres.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.660
And he was blue and my were green.

42:24.660 --> 42:26.140
He says, okay, so count your spheres.

42:26.140 --> 42:31.140
And he said, I have 13 and I said, I have 14, do I win?

42:32.180 --> 42:34.220
And we laughed for 10 minutes after that.

42:34.940 --> 42:39.820
Because it's all this setup and the game is just to count.

42:39.820 --> 42:40.660
Beautiful.

42:40.660 --> 42:41.700
Which of course it wasn't.

42:41.700 --> 42:42.540
Beautiful.

42:42.540 --> 42:43.380
Right?

42:43.380 --> 42:45.620
And I'm not ridiculing him.

42:45.620 --> 42:47.100
There's no ridicule at all.

42:47.100 --> 42:49.460
The laughter is about, again,

42:49.460 --> 42:52.140
a capacity to suddenly see through,

42:52.140 --> 42:57.140
and again, to really properly move

42:58.660 --> 43:00.300
between taking things seriously

43:00.300 --> 43:01.620
and not taking them seriously.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.460
Beautiful.

43:02.460 --> 43:03.300
And there's a joy there.

43:03.300 --> 43:04.140
Beautiful.

43:04.140 --> 43:05.940
And I'll put these two together, right?

43:07.220 --> 43:08.700
If we can think of,

43:09.660 --> 43:11.820
if we can broaden our sense of the comic

43:11.820 --> 43:16.820
to that which induces or conduces laughter.

43:16.980 --> 43:20.180
And then if we can remember that a lot of our laughter

43:20.180 --> 43:22.300
is not the laughter of ridicule,

43:22.300 --> 43:25.400
but the laughter of celebration of our ability

43:25.400 --> 43:27.700
to open up to reality.

43:27.700 --> 43:31.380
And then if we can put that with laughter and comedy

43:31.380 --> 43:34.420
as reminding us not to get entrapped

43:34.420 --> 43:36.180
in an idolatry of the literal,

43:36.180 --> 43:39.940
I'm getting a sense now of how the comic

43:39.940 --> 43:43.460
can be part of the numinous.

43:44.780 --> 43:47.620
So another moment that comes to mind about this,

43:47.620 --> 43:49.600
so now this is really singing for me,

43:49.600 --> 43:53.020
is that scene in C.S. Lewis

43:53.020 --> 43:55.260
where the kids haven't met Aslan yet.

43:55.260 --> 43:59.260
And they say, is he a tame lion?

43:59.260 --> 44:02.380
And all the animals go, oh, of course,

44:02.380 --> 44:05.140
and they're laughing, but he's good.

44:05.140 --> 44:06.980
Yeah, yes.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.980
So there's a punchline and there's humor,

44:08.980 --> 44:10.060
and there's, right?

44:10.060 --> 44:13.340
But nevertheless, the humor is in service of how numinous.

44:13.340 --> 44:14.680
And it is ironic.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.460
And it's ironic, I'm getting it now.

44:16.460 --> 44:19.420
And it's so ironic about that is what the kids are saying,

44:19.420 --> 44:22.620
what the kids are asking is, can we trust him?

44:22.620 --> 44:23.460
Yes.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.300
That's the question, right?

44:24.300 --> 44:25.120
Yes.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.340
And the irony is yes, but you have no idea

44:28.380 --> 44:29.420
just how much.

44:29.420 --> 44:31.300
Right, and you also don't,

44:31.300 --> 44:33.060
it's the sensibility transcendence.

44:33.060 --> 44:35.380
Not only do you need to have an insight into him,

44:35.380 --> 44:37.060
you need to have a reflective insight in it.

44:37.060 --> 44:38.900
You really don't understand trust yet.

44:38.900 --> 44:39.740
Right.

44:39.740 --> 44:43.300
You think of trust as, can I predict somebody?

44:43.300 --> 44:46.100
Right, right, right, right, right.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.220
Does what you're saying,

44:47.220 --> 44:50.260
what you're saying participates in what is real,

44:50.260 --> 44:54.100
unknowingly and yet beautifully and continuously,

44:54.100 --> 44:56.620
and to such a degree that you can't begin to imagine

44:56.660 --> 44:57.740
how it participates.

44:57.740 --> 44:59.180
Yes, exactly, exactly.

44:59.180 --> 45:02.100
It's, your story inspires me to tell one too,

45:02.100 --> 45:04.980
which is, I think, a similar friend of mine,

45:04.980 --> 45:07.740
Leslie Giley, who's one of the funniest people I know,

45:08.620 --> 45:11.220
and who's, and incidentally, who's Catholicism,

45:11.220 --> 45:13.500
I think is quite beautiful and quite inspiring,

45:13.500 --> 45:15.140
quite sophisticated.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.860
So I think of him at a moment like this.

45:16.860 --> 45:21.860
And this was many years ago,

45:21.860 --> 45:22.900
we were gathered together,

45:22.900 --> 45:26.100
a few of us friends we were watching the Olympics.

45:26.100 --> 45:31.100
And the Olympic hockey, which was a big deal in our house.

45:31.540 --> 45:32.380
Canada.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.220
Big deal.

45:33.220 --> 45:34.620
The official religion of Canada.

45:34.620 --> 45:36.260
The official religion of Canada, yes.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.700
The ethical religion,

45:37.700 --> 45:39.260
but sometimes it borders on the religious.

45:39.260 --> 45:41.180
Yeah, right, well said, well said.

45:41.180 --> 45:44.060
We can teleologically suspend the ethical for hockey.

45:45.260 --> 45:49.700
And it was the Olympics that was actually held in Canada,

45:49.700 --> 45:52.420
where Team Canada won the gold medal for hockey.

45:52.420 --> 45:54.700
And so it was quite an uproarious, okay?

45:54.700 --> 45:55.540
It's right.

45:55.540 --> 45:57.140
It was about as sacred as it could be

45:57.140 --> 45:59.700
without being in the proper category of the religious.

45:59.700 --> 46:01.340
And like we said, it's pretty close.

46:01.340 --> 46:02.420
Right.

46:02.420 --> 46:06.180
And so we go out for a walk afterwards

46:06.180 --> 46:11.060
and just really flesh, identifying very personally,

46:11.060 --> 46:12.380
very closely with this victory,

46:12.380 --> 46:13.620
which is interesting to me now.

46:13.620 --> 46:15.940
I don't think I would necessarily have the same reaction,

46:15.940 --> 46:17.980
but at the time it was very important.

46:19.260 --> 46:20.660
And we're walking down the street

46:20.660 --> 46:23.700
and there's a man who's,

46:24.700 --> 46:26.460
what is it, one or two?

46:26.460 --> 46:27.900
And he walking in our direction

46:27.900 --> 46:30.220
and they're clearly evangelizing.

46:30.220 --> 46:32.940
And I don't know what denomination they are,

46:32.940 --> 46:35.100
but they're evangelizing and they look at us

46:35.100 --> 46:36.900
and they sort of, they take on this sort of

46:36.900 --> 46:39.340
kind of solicitous manner like,

46:39.340 --> 46:41.780
oh, we're going to engage you in conversation.

46:41.780 --> 46:43.540
And we walk closer together

46:43.540 --> 46:44.860
and then my friend Leslie says,

46:44.860 --> 46:46.340
have you heard the good news?

46:50.020 --> 46:51.380
Now this is coming from a person

46:51.380 --> 46:52.900
who's properly religious, right?

46:52.900 --> 46:53.660
Yeah.

46:53.660 --> 46:56.380
And yet the irony of the way that something

46:56.380 --> 46:59.820
that is by all comparison, relatively profane,

46:59.820 --> 47:02.940
participates in what is sacred, right?

47:02.940 --> 47:04.780
If only by indirection.

47:04.780 --> 47:05.620
Right, right.

47:05.620 --> 47:07.140
It's something that is present in the humor

47:07.140 --> 47:08.180
and present in the joke.

47:08.180 --> 47:09.420
That's really good, that's really good.

47:09.420 --> 47:13.900
Anyway, so I think, so this connection,

47:13.900 --> 47:16.420
the other thing that the humorist does,

47:16.420 --> 47:19.620
and this is again, present in what is comical about Christ

47:19.620 --> 47:21.380
and comical about the incarnation.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.780
Again, not ridicule.

47:22.780 --> 47:24.700
No, comical.

47:24.700 --> 47:26.140
Right, the comic is not,

47:26.140 --> 47:27.980
so you've taken pains to say this

47:27.980 --> 47:29.380
and we should take more.

47:30.860 --> 47:35.860
The comic, comedy is often associated with cruelty

47:36.460 --> 47:38.140
and it needn't be, right?

47:38.140 --> 47:39.100
It really needn't be.

47:39.100 --> 47:41.740
So when I say, and when he says

47:41.740 --> 47:45.180
that the incarnation is comic,

47:45.180 --> 47:47.140
he is not debasing it.

47:47.140 --> 47:47.980
We're ridiculing it.

47:47.980 --> 47:48.820
He's not dispraising it.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.940
He's not ridiculing it.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.980
He's not trying to remove its sacredness.

47:52.980 --> 47:57.740
The profanity of the absurdity of the incarnation

47:57.740 --> 48:01.100
taking place in the lowliest setting imaginable

48:01.100 --> 48:02.460
in dexes to the sacred.

48:02.460 --> 48:06.740
And he dies, the death of a criminal and a terrorist.

48:06.740 --> 48:09.620
Right, you were talking earlier about,

48:09.620 --> 48:11.180
in one of our previous sessions,

48:11.180 --> 48:15.900
about the Socratic eros and how it transmutes

48:15.900 --> 48:18.700
from the lowly and sexual, the lowly and sexual.

48:18.700 --> 48:19.540
You know what I mean?

48:19.860 --> 48:23.740
To the anagogic.

48:23.740 --> 48:24.780
To the anagogic.

48:24.780 --> 48:27.940
And we have to think of this in the same way, right?

48:27.940 --> 48:32.340
Yes, there's a sense in which returning to the cave,

48:32.340 --> 48:35.100
of course, makes you susceptible to tragedy

48:35.100 --> 48:36.780
and that's in Plato's mind.

48:36.780 --> 48:39.540
But it also has, Plato puts a comedy in there

48:39.540 --> 48:43.140
because there's a joke there

48:43.140 --> 48:44.500
because when he comes back,

48:44.500 --> 48:46.300
he's stumbling around

48:46.300 --> 48:47.820
because his eyes aren't used to the dark

48:47.820 --> 48:50.420
and he's saying things that nobody believes.

48:50.420 --> 48:54.740
There's a then story like that about two frogs

48:54.740 --> 48:57.820
and one is at a pond and another one goes away.

48:58.780 --> 49:00.380
And it comes back.

49:00.380 --> 49:02.540
And the first frog says to the second,

49:02.540 --> 49:03.660
what happened?

49:03.660 --> 49:07.100
And he said, well, I saw the ocean.

49:07.100 --> 49:10.420
And the first frog says, is it half as big as my pond?

49:13.180 --> 49:15.980
And the first frog goes, no, it's bigger.

49:16.020 --> 49:18.620
It's a three quarters the size of my pond.

49:19.860 --> 49:22.180
And the second frog goes, no, no.

49:22.180 --> 49:24.940
And then he goes, well, is it as big as my pond?

49:26.020 --> 49:29.860
And then the second frog says, no, it's way bigger

49:29.860 --> 49:31.420
than you can, and then it says,

49:31.420 --> 49:33.980
and then the first frog's head explodes.

49:35.980 --> 49:38.020
But it's the same kind of thing.

49:38.020 --> 49:42.620
Like you realize that when the person comes back,

49:42.620 --> 49:45.860
in some sense, and there's something

49:46.740 --> 49:49.380
like you have to be really careful about here,

49:49.380 --> 49:51.060
the person that comes back after,

49:51.060 --> 49:55.820
the enlightened person that comes back, right?

49:55.820 --> 49:59.620
Can see him a buffoon, can see him a buffoon.

49:59.620 --> 50:04.620
Absolutely, and that's why the irony

50:06.260 --> 50:11.260
in order to be transmuted into a religious attitude

50:12.300 --> 50:14.680
needs to become humorous

50:14.720 --> 50:17.880
because the, oh, wait, I see it.

50:17.880 --> 50:21.400
That way the person takes up, oh, this is almost like Girard

50:21.400 --> 50:25.880
about like the sacrifice undermining the scapegoating.

50:25.880 --> 50:30.080
What the person, the sage, takes up,

50:30.080 --> 50:34.320
allows the projection of potential buffoonery and ridicule,

50:34.320 --> 50:37.560
and that but plays with the humor in there

50:37.560 --> 50:40.360
in order to turn it properly back on the person.

50:40.360 --> 50:41.520
That's right.

50:41.560 --> 50:45.880
So this reminds me of Woodruff's discussion

50:45.880 --> 50:50.880
in his book, Virtue, sorry, Reverence to Lost Virtue.

50:50.880 --> 50:55.200
He says, we now think of irreverence,

50:55.200 --> 50:56.520
and we take it as a compliment,

50:56.520 --> 51:00.360
but he said the job, satire is not ultimately

51:00.360 --> 51:01.840
about irreverence.

51:01.840 --> 51:05.000
It's about getting you to find irreverence for the idol

51:05.000 --> 51:08.320
so you get into proper reverence for the reality.

51:08.320 --> 51:10.240
Exactly, exactly.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.040
Irreverence toward the king means reverence to God.

51:13.040 --> 51:13.880
Exactly, exactly.

51:13.880 --> 51:14.720
Render unto, right?

51:14.720 --> 51:16.560
Yeah, yes, yes.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.600
That's exactly right.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.960
That's exactly right.

51:18.960 --> 51:23.960
And that's why great humorists,

51:27.680 --> 51:30.400
that's why the irreverence of a great humorist

51:30.400 --> 51:33.320
conceals a deep reverence for what is real.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.640
Only so much.

51:34.640 --> 51:35.720
It's like al-Athea.

51:35.720 --> 51:37.640
It's concealed, but it's also revealed.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.480
Yes.

51:38.520 --> 51:42.960
Those who have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, right?

51:42.960 --> 51:46.120
Yes, yes, because they stand outside of the arena,

51:46.120 --> 51:49.960
right at its outer perimeter, out on the horizon.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.800
That's right.

51:50.800 --> 51:51.640
The horizon of wonder.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.800
That's right, they stand on the horizon of wonder,

51:53.800 --> 51:57.600
and their irreverence refers attention to that horizon.

51:57.600 --> 51:59.880
If it is understood properly, and often it isn't,

51:59.880 --> 52:01.560
that's why we kill them.

52:01.560 --> 52:03.480
We kill them, literally or figuratively,

52:03.480 --> 52:06.280
we are in the business right now of killing good humorists

52:06.280 --> 52:08.200
as much as we possibly can, right?

52:09.040 --> 52:11.760
Right, now think of the idea of offense, right?

52:11.760 --> 52:14.640
Kierkegaard's idea of offense as the denial,

52:14.640 --> 52:18.640
the refusal of the beholding gaze of agape

52:18.640 --> 52:21.680
that reforms your relationship to yourself

52:21.680 --> 52:24.240
and the ground of your being to take offense at that,

52:24.240 --> 52:27.480
the idea of taking offense at that, right?

52:27.480 --> 52:30.040
Think of the offense we have at the comedian

52:30.040 --> 52:33.440
that has us know ourselves by some measure

52:33.440 --> 52:37.120
that is well beyond our capacity to self-determine,

52:37.120 --> 52:40.560
to auto-poeticize, and to manage for ourselves.

52:40.560 --> 52:43.680
We take offense at the idea that we could be so known

52:43.680 --> 52:45.320
and so naked by some measure

52:45.320 --> 52:47.440
that we have not the control over.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.160
We take offense at the idea that we do not know ourselves.

52:50.160 --> 52:53.000
Yes, exactly, and we refuse to be known.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.360
You shall not know me,

52:55.360 --> 52:57.800
I shall not know myself through you.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.360
No, I shall not.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.240
I refuse that love.

53:01.240 --> 53:02.600
Remember, knowing and love,

53:02.600 --> 53:05.720
we've made this identity claim before.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.840
I refuse that love,

53:06.840 --> 53:08.040
I refuse your knowing,

53:08.040 --> 53:11.000
I refuse the knowing of myself on your terms

53:11.000 --> 53:12.920
because they are not mine.

53:12.920 --> 53:15.640
Our offense at the comedian is in some sense

53:15.640 --> 53:18.160
a version of our offense at the Christ.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.720
So it's the opposite of the Socratic know-thyself

53:20.720 --> 53:22.000
as the aspirational, right?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.760
And it's mythology going back to that term again, right?

53:24.760 --> 53:29.760
Okay, so again, this is deepening the point

53:29.760 --> 53:33.680
about this sort of primary orientation,

53:33.680 --> 53:36.680
the fundamental framing, the meta-optimal grip,

53:36.680 --> 53:37.680
the meta-orientation,

53:37.680 --> 53:39.760
the orientation to our orientation, right?

53:39.760 --> 53:42.200
That we're bringing into the practices, right?

53:42.200 --> 53:44.280
We're adding all of this nuance.

53:44.280 --> 53:48.440
We're building the mythos around, right?

53:48.440 --> 53:50.360
We're building a mythos scaffolding

53:50.360 --> 53:53.080
to help people take up the orientation

53:53.080 --> 53:56.640
that is needed for practicing dialectic into the elogues.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.840
That's right, that's right.

54:00.440 --> 54:01.280
So,

54:01.280 --> 54:06.280
so what,

54:10.960 --> 54:14.920
what do we, like, what am I trying to say?

54:14.920 --> 54:17.000
We've hit something, just.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.120
Yeah, no, no.

54:18.120 --> 54:19.120
Well, there's an aporia here.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.400
Hold it for a second, yeah.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.920
But there's a connection too.

54:26.680 --> 54:30.200
Because I can think of, like this stance

54:30.200 --> 54:33.600
of being able to challenge the ethical in service

54:33.600 --> 54:37.920
of religio, the connectedness, the relatedness.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.320
The ratio religio, right?

54:40.320 --> 54:43.120
And I'm thinking not only of, like we,

54:43.120 --> 54:48.120
there are, I think the proper practice of this

54:49.520 --> 54:52.360
within a spiritual community dialectic into the elogues.

54:52.360 --> 54:54.640
I'm thinking of work that people like David Fuller

54:54.640 --> 54:57.120
and others are doing of having the conversations

54:57.120 --> 54:58.400
that we're not allowed to have.

54:58.440 --> 55:03.440
Not because we want to espouse a racism or a sexism

55:04.400 --> 55:07.640
or any kind of unethical behavior,

55:07.640 --> 55:12.400
but because we want to seek beyond these ethical frameworks

55:12.400 --> 55:16.160
a way of re-grounding the ethical in something

55:16.160 --> 55:19.000
that it is in the service of, right?

55:19.000 --> 55:23.280
And that we can't have these conversations.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.520
And so what I'm thinking of is another dimension

55:27.560 --> 55:29.280
of the scaffolding, which is,

55:29.280 --> 55:33.360
and this is of course requires tremendous care

55:33.360 --> 55:36.560
in both the sense of caution and taking care of,

55:37.600 --> 55:39.400
that in addition to what we just said,

55:39.400 --> 55:42.640
getting this finesse between taking ourselves too seriously

55:42.640 --> 55:45.520
and not taking ourselves seriously enough.

55:45.520 --> 55:48.680
Dialectic in the elogues also requires an ability

55:48.680 --> 55:51.640
to talk about things that we're not supposed to talk about,

55:51.640 --> 55:53.680
to have the difficult conversations.

55:53.680 --> 55:58.680
And to understand that those conversations are,

56:02.120 --> 56:04.720
they're not the end and object.

56:04.720 --> 56:07.360
No, because the conversations are not driven

56:07.360 --> 56:09.200
towards coming to a conclusion.

56:09.200 --> 56:13.240
They're trying to get us both to a kind of giving birth

56:13.240 --> 56:15.920
to ourselves that we're not capable on our own.

56:15.920 --> 56:19.520
And so like just as an example on it,

56:19.520 --> 56:20.440
I'm not going to get into it

56:20.440 --> 56:23.160
because YouTube is not the place to do this,

56:23.160 --> 56:28.160
but there is so much invocation of justice right now

56:28.240 --> 56:32.120
and so little deologos about justice,

56:32.120 --> 56:35.880
which Socrates and Plato and the Republic

56:35.880 --> 56:40.880
would find so abhorrent, so deeply, deeply disgusting.

56:42.080 --> 56:45.160
And that's what I mean about standing back and saying,

56:45.160 --> 56:47.280
why are we invoking this so much?

56:47.280 --> 56:50.880
And yet we pretend it's pretentious

56:50.920 --> 56:54.560
as if we completely get what justice is

56:54.560 --> 56:57.600
and we know it and we have it and we've got it

56:57.600 --> 56:58.800
and there's no question.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.280
And it's like, to me, that is also an example

57:02.280 --> 57:06.400
of people stuck in the ethical, right?

57:06.400 --> 57:08.640
The reduction of justice to law,

57:08.640 --> 57:10.400
the reduction of justice to law,

57:10.400 --> 57:14.160
whether it be formally or informally,

57:14.160 --> 57:16.120
however we define it, right?

57:16.120 --> 57:18.120
But that non-identity is precise

57:18.120 --> 57:19.080
that has a non-identity.

57:19.080 --> 57:22.960
I want to have deep discussions like this.

57:22.960 --> 57:26.320
I want to get into deologos like Socrates does

57:26.320 --> 57:29.440
in the Republic about justice.

57:30.440 --> 57:33.520
And I feel like we can't do it right now

57:33.520 --> 57:35.560
because anything that we say

57:35.560 --> 57:38.440
that calls particular slogans about justice

57:38.440 --> 57:40.840
into proper question for reflection

57:40.840 --> 57:45.840
will brand us immediately as unethical individuals.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.600
Right, well, but this goes to Beck,

57:48.600 --> 57:51.680
and this is as you know,

57:51.680 --> 57:54.480
we can gesture to dozens of hours of lectures

57:54.480 --> 57:55.560
to this effect.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.160
This is one of the consequences

57:57.160 --> 57:58.000
of the meaning crisis.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.040
Yes, yes.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.380
Is that the loss of the religious category

58:01.380 --> 58:06.380
of thought and action has resulted in the idolatry.

58:07.200 --> 58:08.360
The idolatry of the ethical.

58:08.360 --> 58:12.240
Right, and that's why we have pseudo-religious,

58:12.240 --> 58:16.160
meta-meaning systems, systems that were meaningful

58:16.160 --> 58:17.440
but not meta-meaningful,

58:17.440 --> 58:22.000
that had no capacity to govern intercategorically

58:22.000 --> 58:24.460
the way that we arrange meaning, right?

58:24.460 --> 58:26.000
Like political ideologies

58:26.000 --> 58:27.840
that have no business being religious

58:27.840 --> 58:30.840
but are elevated and deified to that category

58:30.840 --> 58:32.320
because they are.

58:32.320 --> 58:33.360
They're trying to fill the vacuum.

58:33.360 --> 58:34.720
They're trying to fill the vacuum

58:34.720 --> 58:38.840
and it is a deeply, deeply dangerous case

58:38.840 --> 58:40.280
of mistaken identity.

58:40.280 --> 58:41.480
Yes, yes.

58:41.480 --> 58:45.920
Right, and we can just like, you know, the examples are so,

58:45.920 --> 58:47.640
they're so voluminous, they're so obvious.

58:47.640 --> 58:49.360
We don't even need to enumerate them

58:49.360 --> 58:51.200
but they're rife right now.

58:51.200 --> 58:54.960
And it's because when we lose that category of orientation

58:54.960 --> 58:56.400
we drop a tear down.

58:56.400 --> 58:58.720
It's a pretty significant tear, right?

58:58.720 --> 59:01.520
It's a difference of kind, fundamentally.

59:01.520 --> 59:05.080
But it's exactly parallel, proportionally parallel

59:05.080 --> 59:07.360
to the person living the aesthetic life

59:07.360 --> 59:11.360
who, right, tries to.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.720
The Puerta Ernest, yeah.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.320
Yeah, yeah, right, who's trying

59:15.320 --> 59:16.920
to find a spiritual, right?

59:16.920 --> 59:19.720
He's even trying to, there's a vacuum

59:19.720 --> 59:21.120
of ethical orientation.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.880
Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.

59:22.880 --> 59:26.720
Well, as you pointed out, I think very wisely yesterday

59:26.720 --> 59:28.120
when we talk about the aesthetic

59:28.120 --> 59:30.760
and it's a rough mapping but I think it's very apt.

59:30.760 --> 59:33.200
It's to the aesthetic and the ethical and the religious

59:33.200 --> 59:35.360
as the child is the adult, the adult is the aesthetic.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.040
Right, the child is the aesthetic,

59:37.040 --> 59:41.880
the adult is the ethical and the sage is the religious.

59:41.880 --> 59:44.240
And incidentally, I mean, I think we've made this clear

59:44.280 --> 59:46.400
but just in case there is necessary

59:46.400 --> 59:49.000
and independent value in each of these stages, right?

59:49.000 --> 59:49.840
Of course.

59:49.840 --> 59:52.400
We don't want to lose, we don't want to lose

59:52.400 --> 59:55.080
the ideality of playfulness that belongs

59:55.080 --> 59:56.240
to the province of the child.

59:56.240 --> 59:57.480
There's a reason that Kierkegaard

59:57.480 --> 59:59.800
really got along with kids, right?

59:59.800 --> 01:00:02.840
And in Jesus, you have to be like children

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.680
to enter the kingdom.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.120
That's right, that's right.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.480
Our development comes through serious play, right?

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.480
Which children, of course, exemplify, right?

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.240
And of course, there is tremendous value

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.960
to the ethical, right?

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.880
And you see the great figures, like Socrates,

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.360
criticizing the laws of Athens

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:28.280
but refusing to leave when they have pronounced his death.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.480
Jesus saying, I haven't come to throw away the law

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.480
but to fulfill it, right?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.560
And you get these constant,

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.520
where you get St. Paul.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.880
Once again, the paradox of that.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.640
Right, wrestling between law and love, right?

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.480
Or the parable of the prodigal son,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.040
where if you, like the prodigal son for me

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.320
is I come back to it again and again

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.120
because if you land on any one of the identities

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.800
and absolutize it, you don't get the parable.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.560
And that's the classic, and that is that by definition,

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:03.640
I think by Schindler's definition is what mythology is,

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.920
that the denial of the logos, the hate of the logos

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:10.160
is mistaking the part for the whole.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.200
Mistaking any, the part of any one of these perspectives,

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.000
the part of any one of these stages

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.560
as being absolute in itself,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.800
rather than being something that participates in what is.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.960
And let's add the two things to it.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.360
They go exactly with it.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:24.720
The mythology is also that the logos

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.440
is always instrumental and in service of something else.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:29.280
Yes, but what is all of this for?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.920
What if it's for what it is, right?

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.520
It's about the abundant life, the life worth living.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.040
And then the other is, well, let's get to a conclusion.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.080
Let's get to the bottom line, right?

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.240
Give me something final.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.080
What's the bottom line in the parable of the prodigal son?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.040
You tell me.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.360
What's the bottom line in the crucifixion?

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.360
What's the bottom line in Socrates' trial?

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:54.040
Like, you're not understanding it.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.480
Exactly, exactly.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.400
And so mythology is also that which has us take offense

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.280
at the possibility of agape,

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.240
which is a form of knowing and being known

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.880
that is inexhaustible and is not brought to anything

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.200
so final as what is so desired.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.840
Right, and therefore it is also,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.760
and this is one of the great, to my mind,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.480
one of the reasons why I think Christianity

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.640
hasn't profunded it yet,

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:17.320
which is the deep co-identification

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.960
of agape and the logos, right?

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.560
Because the mythology is not only the foreclosure

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.600
on agape, it is the foreclosure, therefore also,

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:29.360
of the logos, and we have to understand them.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.000
And I think in this paradox that he talks about,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
in this paradox, they are co-identified.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.000
So there's a way in which, right,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.760
and I'm not, I don't propose we resolve it right now,

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.760
but what I'm seeing, again, to help get people oriented,

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:52.680
is I'm seeing this interplay between comedy and tragedy,

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.640
not taking ourselves too seriously.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.000
In order to take ourselves seriously.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.160
Right, right, and then there's also this interplay

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.800
between logos and agape, and they're like,

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.920
I see them as these opponent things,

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.280
and then there's the nexus between them,

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.400
and that's the place we wanna be in

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.240
when we are exercising the practice.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.800
Yes, and it is not a place that we can articulate.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.080
No. It is ineffable.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.080
No, no, but what we can do, we can live in it.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.000
Yeah, we can live it, and we can triangulate ways

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.640
in which, like Tillich, in which we can find the tonos,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.880
and we can find the tonos,

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.400
and we can find the tonos between the different, right,

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.040
and where they touch on each other and bear on each other.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.960
That's right.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.400
Yeah.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.480
I think this was wonderful.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.240
I think this was fantastic.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:37.240
So thank you so, so much.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.200
This was excellent.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.040
It was.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.000
Can I maybe just finish us off with one more?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.480
Oh, please.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.400
Because this one is, this one is a little less obvious,

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.040
but I think all the better for it.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.000
So bear with me.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Okay. Bear with me.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:52.960
Bear with me.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.920
Instantly transforming oneself,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.520
how to become a jellyfish.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.360
And the question is,

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.760
how does the self acquire its own selfhood

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.040
if it is merely a receptacle for absorbing external values?

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:15.200
There was a creature about which I fall into reverie rather often.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.000
It is the jellyfish.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.200
Have you noticed how this gelatinous mass

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.280
can flatten itself into a plate

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.560
and then slowly sink, then rise so still and firm

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.800
that one would think one could step on it?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:31.520
Now notice, now it notices its prey approaching,

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.920
then it funnels into itself,

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.520
becomes a pouch and sinks with prodigious speed,

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.200
deeper and deeper with its speed snatching in its prey.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.720
Not into its pouch, for it does not have a pouch,

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:48.640
but into itself, for it is itself a pouch and nothing else.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.640
It is so able to contract itself

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.640
that one cannot imagine how it could possibly extend itself.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640
It is just about the same with you.

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.640
And you must forgive me that I have not had

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.640
a more beautiful creature with which to compare you.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.640
And also that you perhaps can hardly keep from smiling

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.640
at the thought of yourself as nothing but a pouch.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.640
That is so consonant with everything,

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:17.640
like we've been talking about and also, you know,

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:25.640
being tracking Socrates and trying to follow the logos.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.640
And it also reminds me of L.A. Paul's stuff

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.640
about people offering to turn you into a vampire

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:33.640
and you can't possibly know what that is like.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.640
But the humor gets you into the serious play

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.640
between the perspectives.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.640
That was perfect for ending it.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.640
Thank you so much.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:46.640
Thank you, everyone.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.640
For your time and attention.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.640
Take good care.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.640
Kierkegaard seems to be also presenting it

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.640
as a positive and good thing,

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.640
but he's suffering it in this profound way.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.640
This is what I'm hearing you saying.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.640
This is almost ripping him to pieces.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.640
And yet in Socrates,

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.640
it seems to be sitting there harmoniously together.
