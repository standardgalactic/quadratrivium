00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Ravik.

00:04.680 --> 00:12.560
I'm very excited about this because my good friend and long time interlocutor and philosophical

00:12.560 --> 00:18.880
partner in crime and all the other wonderful epithet we might give to each other is back.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.400
And we're going to have a series of discussions about a very important topic.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.880
And of course, I'm talking about Jordan Hall.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.960
Jordan, it's so great to be with you here again.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.640
And I want you to take some time.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.480
Everybody should know we sort of talked about this before off-camera.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.280
We've got some ideas about basic architecture.

00:39.280 --> 00:42.640
And Jordan's going to propose that, run through it,

00:42.640 --> 00:45.440
and then we'll enter into a more of a dialogical format.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.000
So Jordan, please take it away.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.360
Thank you.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.160
I'm just putting this on.

00:50.160 --> 00:50.960
Do not disturb.

00:50.960 --> 00:58.320
OK, so the topic here, I think last time we talked about it, we pinned the name,

00:58.320 --> 01:05.200
the Neo-Neocortex, or a new form or a new approach to the problem of governance.

01:06.320 --> 01:13.200
And when we talked last time, what I noticed was that I've been running into this particular

01:13.920 --> 01:22.880
territory from a variety of distinct subgroups, subdomains, both different areas

01:22.880 --> 01:26.400
of kind of an intellectual endeavor, but also completely different communities

01:26.400 --> 01:30.400
that in some sense don't even consider themselves to have any real relationship with each other.

01:31.600 --> 01:37.600
And yet, this problem of proper governance in a particularly new fashion

01:38.560 --> 01:44.000
ends up being a bit of a Venn diagram where they're beginning to converge.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.040
And I think increasingly self-aware.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.760
So let me just list a couple of what these domains look like.

01:49.760 --> 01:55.200
And you'll notice that they are, many of them will look at the problem differently.

01:55.200 --> 02:02.000
So for example, the OG, the original point that brought us here was actually your own thing,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.480
the various projects that you're now bringing into the world,

02:04.560 --> 02:08.000
and the conversations I was having with Ryan, correct?

02:09.680 --> 02:13.520
About the particular problem of governance is being central to...

02:13.520 --> 02:14.720
Ryan Barton.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.520
Ryan Barton, right.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.720
Yeah, how do we give rise to a new form of collaboration around the question of,

02:21.280 --> 02:24.560
for example, bringing embodied wisdom more fully into the world?

02:24.560 --> 02:30.560
And how do we do this in a fashion where many of the things that we know just consistently

02:30.560 --> 02:33.280
plague any kind of new institution don't happen?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.240
Like, we'd like to avoid that.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.680
We'd like to preemptively design something where capture, malincentive,

02:39.680 --> 02:46.480
or becoming centralized in a single individual don't occur.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.200
But other places, in the technical world, the space known as DAOS,

02:54.080 --> 02:59.440
which is a piece of the kind of the emerging crypto blockchain universe,

03:00.080 --> 03:03.920
are now very deeply focused on this question of what does proper governance look like?

03:03.920 --> 03:06.640
Now, they may think of it as DAO governance, but my point is,

03:06.640 --> 03:08.640
it's actually looking at a new form of governance.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.560
So I'll get into some detail on that in a moment.

03:12.080 --> 03:18.400
And another individual named Balaji Srinivasan has, I think, pretty well put a stake in the

03:18.400 --> 03:24.160
ground around the thing he's calling network states, which he specifically positions as being

03:26.080 --> 03:34.400
a next step beyond the nation state, and in particular, call for a new form of governance.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.120
And then we'll shift.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.720
So if we're looking at, say, ordinary politics, we can look at some of the problems that are

03:42.720 --> 03:48.560
in the space of the increasing polarization that seems to be happening across the Western world,

03:49.280 --> 03:56.240
and is, in many ways, locked in to the actual design, the underlying architecture of how we

03:56.240 --> 04:03.280
run government produces, invariably, polarization, has a very hard time dealing with polarization.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.800
And so a new form of governance is being called for a look at in those worlds as well.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.000
And I mean, actually, practically.

04:10.640 --> 04:17.520
We can also look at the problem of geopolitics and what looks like the shift of the world,

04:17.520 --> 04:24.240
and from a single hegemonic mono superpower into an increasingly multipolar world,

04:24.800 --> 04:30.320
which we don't really know how to do that, particularly in the context of things like

04:31.600 --> 04:36.400
escalating technological capability, where we can't solve interstate conflicts with

04:36.640 --> 04:44.720
escalating kinetic military conflict, and in the context of an entirely new form of war

04:44.720 --> 04:48.640
called unrestricted warfare, which I'll just flag for those who understand that.

04:48.640 --> 04:55.280
And my kind of cutting edge of investigation of both the multipolar geopolitics

04:55.280 --> 05:01.280
and the notion of unrestricted warfare is also looking at what are new forms of governance

05:01.280 --> 05:03.520
that can respond to this category of problem.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.040
And then shifting again, in the age of Elon, questions around platforms, social media,

05:11.040 --> 05:14.880
in his case, and particularly Twitter, we can think about Facebook and Instagram,

05:14.880 --> 05:23.360
where we recognize that the governance principles like free speech aren't robust enough to respond.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.680
For example, just a simple notion that because Twitter is a private company,

05:27.680 --> 05:32.000
the kind of the juridical principles of freedom of speech in the United States

05:32.240 --> 05:36.320
have a hard time grasping it, and yet clearly it has a very profound role to play

05:36.320 --> 05:39.920
in how the thing called free speech plays out in our polity.

05:39.920 --> 05:47.280
And in fact, Elon has particularly called or pointed towards the direction of Twitter

05:47.280 --> 05:50.960
as a foundation for a new form of collective intelligence.

05:51.840 --> 05:58.640
And so if we can think about how the neo-neocortex and notions like distributed cognition

05:58.640 --> 06:08.160
are related, you can see how there's a grope in that in the direction of a new form of governance.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.080
And I got two more. The groups of individuals that have been looking at how do we tackle the

06:14.080 --> 06:18.960
problem of planetary scale governance. And this includes that whole category of things

06:18.960 --> 06:25.520
that we've talked about, hyper-objects, where the kind of nation-state on steroids,

06:25.520 --> 06:28.880
the international structure like the IMF and the UN,

06:30.720 --> 06:35.680
which was the best the mid-century could pull off, clearly aren't able to deal with planetary

06:35.680 --> 06:39.840
scale governance problems. We again are finding ourselves having to think about

06:39.840 --> 06:46.800
what might a new appropriate form of governance look like. And the last one I'll throw into the mix

06:47.600 --> 06:53.760
is the AI alignment problem, which might feel weird. I mean, I don't mean this necessarily

06:53.760 --> 06:57.040
from the point of view of sort of how do we build a department of AI alignment

06:57.040 --> 07:03.520
as a kind of a regulatory institution. What might we ever, under any circumstances,

07:03.520 --> 07:10.560
put in place that could actually do that job? And I'll get into some detail about

07:10.560 --> 07:15.680
how that plays out in a moment. So that's an example of the diversity of different domains

07:16.240 --> 07:20.240
and the different kinds of groups, many of whom don't believe they're in the same space,

07:20.240 --> 07:27.520
that I personally am spending time with, that this question of what is a novel form of proper

07:27.520 --> 07:33.840
governance, both in terms of its potential and in some sense in terms of its necessity, bring up.

07:35.840 --> 07:44.160
So this is an instance of what Arlen calls problem finding. And one way of understanding that,

07:44.160 --> 07:50.240
one interpretation I've given that is, you have a bunch of problems that seem disparate,

07:51.200 --> 07:56.960
and then you find a core central problem. And children seem to demonstrate this when they

07:56.960 --> 08:01.360
go through developmental stages, you find a core central problem, that if you solve that core

08:01.360 --> 08:07.120
central problem, all these other problems will be significantly either solved or reformulated

08:07.120 --> 08:11.040
in a powerful and insightful manner. You know, I've had to do something like that with my work

08:11.040 --> 08:16.320
on relevance realization, sort of the found problem underneath all these other, what seemed

08:16.320 --> 08:21.440
like disparate problems in categorization, etc. So it sounds to me like you're proposing that kind

08:21.440 --> 08:26.560
of thing, that like, here's a bunch of things that seem disparate. But if you write, they intersect

08:26.560 --> 08:31.760
at this core problem, and if this course problem gets addressed, it will systemically and systematically

08:31.760 --> 08:36.400
feed out to the other problems and bring about a very comprehensive change.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.240
Yes, yes, I think that's exactly right. And what it would look like from the inside for some of

08:42.240 --> 08:48.160
these particular domains would be a kind of a different way of looking at the whole problem

08:48.160 --> 08:52.560
that they're looking at, which would resolve a gordian knot, for example.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.400
Yes, yes, yes. And facilitate coordination between the groups too.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.720
Exactly, quite to the point, which in many cases might avoid some catastrophes that happen when

09:02.800 --> 09:09.040
they're unconsciously coordinating, for example, AI and unrestricted warfare. And this is a situation

09:09.040 --> 09:13.040
where they're implicitly coordinating in a negative way, and we'd actually like to invert that

09:13.040 --> 09:19.360
relationship. And so, to the point there, something that I think also comes up in this

09:19.360 --> 09:27.120
kind of conversation is that, for me at least, this investigation is not a kind of a question of

09:27.920 --> 09:34.080
a progressive effort to just make a better kind of governance. And it's certainly not even vaguely

09:34.080 --> 09:39.200
utopian. In some senses, it's almost the exact inverse. It's just more a question of necessity

09:39.200 --> 09:46.400
and timing. My sense of things is just we happen to be here. We're in a moment where there are

09:46.400 --> 09:52.640
profound changes that are afoot, and that if existing global institutions and existing forms

09:52.640 --> 09:57.440
of governance could in fact provide adequate governance to allow us to navigate these problems,

09:57.440 --> 10:02.320
then we should just do that. But it's only in fact because they don't, that we're going to have to

10:02.320 --> 10:09.200
take this sort of step. So that's the dose of practicality that I think is important if you're

10:09.200 --> 10:17.760
going to step into this space. So what I'd like to do is I'd like to drop two big conceptual

10:17.760 --> 10:22.320
frameworks that I personally have talked about in the past, but it's been a while. And I don't

10:22.320 --> 10:28.880
think, I think it's worth kind of articulating them in a little bit of detail, both to help frame

10:28.880 --> 10:33.680
the nature of the transition to the shift, and also to begin creating the,

10:35.440 --> 10:38.320
funny, I think of it as the phase space or the vector diagram of what the

10:39.040 --> 10:48.000
kind of the proper solution looks like. So the first one is the, I guess, the philosophical

10:48.080 --> 10:53.120
or the theoretical framework of media studies, and particularly McLuhan.

10:54.240 --> 10:59.280
So here, one way of looking at things is to say that we're currently living in a world

10:59.280 --> 11:06.800
that is in many ways a result of literacy, of writing, that we are living in the era of literacy.

11:06.800 --> 11:13.040
And if we can think about the kinds of shifts that have occurred, and both in terms of kind

11:13.360 --> 11:21.280
rate and comprehensivity, it helps us get, I think, both a sense of how we got to where we are

11:21.280 --> 11:26.560
and also what it will look like by necessity as we're going to where we're going. So the first

11:26.560 --> 11:31.760
point would be something like, if we wind the clock back to the medieval world, and we drop

11:31.760 --> 11:38.480
ourselves into 1440 in the Gutenberg press, and then we identify changes that occur. And I'm going

11:38.480 --> 11:42.560
to say at the level of governance, and this might bring up some questions about what I've

11:42.560 --> 11:49.440
been mean by that term, but things like the Protestant Revolution and things like the

11:49.440 --> 11:56.240
Thirty Years' War. And there was a fundamental shift of the infrastructure of governance in

11:56.240 --> 12:01.440
the eruption of Protestantism, which I, in this case, will propose was at least meaningfully attached

12:01.440 --> 12:12.160
to the rise of literacy or the written book, which then itself presaged, but also combined with the

12:12.160 --> 12:17.920
implications of literacy in the more political domain, and this gave rise to the Thirty Years'

12:17.920 --> 12:24.080
War. But other domains like the emergence of the Royal Society, which could only happen when

12:24.080 --> 12:29.920
people were literate, and people who could write were sharing written works with each other,

12:29.920 --> 12:34.240
and could be engaging in the peer-to-peer collaborative discovery of the nature of

12:34.240 --> 12:41.280
reality in a very different fashion. And I would point even more pointedly to the emergence of

12:43.120 --> 12:48.960
the shift of the Constitution, and the fact that we now live in a world that is profoundly

12:48.960 --> 12:53.680
constitutional from the throughout the 19th century. And of course, as a result of two

12:53.680 --> 13:01.120
major world wars, most of the world is now living in a form of government that is founded in a

13:01.120 --> 13:09.040
written document, a constitution, which is unconsciously, I think in many ways, simply a

13:09.040 --> 13:14.800
consequence of thinking that that's the proper way to do things. One aspect of which, by the way,

13:14.800 --> 13:20.800
is the Napoleonic Code. And I was looking at some conversations recently coming out of Africa where

13:21.360 --> 13:25.840
we're talking about the fact that the efforts of the Napoleonic Code, which is a governance by

13:25.840 --> 13:32.160
proposition, don't work very well. And that the countries that found themselves subject to that

13:32.160 --> 13:37.280
form of governance have not fared as well as those who were able to operate using the common law,

13:37.280 --> 13:44.720
which I would say is governance by participatory relationship. And which, by the way, connected

13:44.720 --> 13:51.200
with their indigenous governance methodologies upon getting back. And then finally, just to make

13:51.200 --> 13:56.080
sure the space of the scope of what we're talking about is rolled in, the notion of corporations

13:56.080 --> 14:01.840
and things like the British East India Company, which in many ways, both were built on top of and

14:01.840 --> 14:08.480
massively innovated the technologies of bureaucracy, which of course is the training people to be

14:08.480 --> 14:14.960
literate and then taking those literate people to run a global empire on the basis of what is

14:14.960 --> 14:21.600
effectively handwritten letters and accounting systems. And so this is a story that talks about

14:21.600 --> 14:27.920
the notion of governance and its very shape and scope and how it rolled out over about 500 years.

14:27.920 --> 14:35.280
And then the point is to say, we're now well into the era of the digital. And the digital is different

14:35.280 --> 14:43.040
fundamentally and has profound implications for that same set of scopes. And I would expand,

14:43.040 --> 14:47.200
by the way, to include down deep into the basis of how we produce the notion of individuals.

14:47.200 --> 14:53.600
So it's a psychological question, as well as an institutional question. And one inquiry that

14:53.600 --> 14:56.720
we'll be running into when we ask this question of what is the new form of governance? What is the

14:56.720 --> 15:01.440
neo-New York Cortex? What is the new set of literacies and the new forms of generative grammar,

15:02.160 --> 15:06.720
as well as what are the new forms of institution and the new forms of structures?

15:08.080 --> 15:13.520
And we'll be guided by thinking about what are the implications of the essence of the shift of

15:13.520 --> 15:19.840
digital and how that might help us better understand what are the likely kind of laminar flows or the

15:19.840 --> 15:25.520
downhill directionality. Digital is going to be driving us in a certain direction, which may simply

15:25.760 --> 15:30.720
by the way, the release of some of the consequences of writing or literacy,

15:32.080 --> 15:37.120
that'll help us understand better. So I'll return to that when we get past the next big

15:37.120 --> 15:41.840
conceptual chunk. Does all that track so well so far? Yeah, I just wanted to ask what else is

15:41.840 --> 15:48.080
included. I mean, I get the argument, and of course, the literacy argument starts in the axial

15:48.080 --> 15:52.800
revolution, and then you get the introduction of punctuation, and then you get the Carolingian

15:52.800 --> 15:59.600
script, and it ramps up, and it ramps up, and it ramps up. And then as you say, you get the

15:59.600 --> 16:04.160
Protestant Reformation, and you get the possibility of the Scientific Revolution, and then of course,

16:04.160 --> 16:11.440
the Thirty Years' War. And then, attendant to that, and to me, this is part of the emergence of the

16:11.440 --> 16:21.120
idea of the self-constituting state, the social contracting state that contracts itself into

16:21.120 --> 16:28.400
existence through a written contract, that's what a constitution basically is, is dependent on

16:28.400 --> 16:34.720
one of the major consequences of the Thirty Years' War, which is the acceleration of secularism,

16:34.720 --> 16:42.880
the acceleration of the separation of church and state, the making of religion private,

16:42.880 --> 16:49.200
in a way that cuts us off from all of our previous history in a really profound way,

16:50.160 --> 16:56.400
so that a lot of the other ways in which authority, which I take to be the fundamental

16:56.400 --> 17:02.080
capacity for governance, is determined. So there were many other ways in which authority was

17:02.080 --> 17:09.280
determined, and then they get reduced, I would say, via secularism to the notion of the social

17:09.280 --> 17:17.920
contract as typified, as you said. So the authorities accrue to written text, that's why you have to

17:18.000 --> 17:24.880
sign your name, so the written text and the sacred becomes to be associated with the sacred,

17:24.880 --> 17:30.240
the scriptures, the writings, more and more and more in the Protestant revolution,

17:30.240 --> 17:40.880
solar scriptura. And so you get that and the social contract, and that's the only basis for

17:40.880 --> 17:45.360
any authority, there's no other basis for authority, whereas there used to be things

17:46.000 --> 17:57.520
reasonably like tradition, religion, kinship systems, all kinds of things that limited

17:58.400 --> 18:03.920
the political economic enterprises that human beings engage in. All of those are basically

18:03.920 --> 18:10.000
removed. Well, I'm not saying they're removed completely, but they're denuded, they're diminished,

18:10.080 --> 18:15.440
they're demarcated off. Does that track is also part of what you're talking about?

18:16.080 --> 18:24.880
Absolutely. In fact, perfectly. Yeah, in fact, let me just move into the next piece,

18:24.880 --> 18:29.280
because there's so many different directions. Let me hold this, but there's something about,

18:29.280 --> 18:33.920
so I'm now going to take a skew or a bleak look that cuts through the frame

18:34.880 --> 18:40.720
and in many ways, producing some really interesting synergies. So this has to do with that whole

18:43.520 --> 18:47.440
framework of complexity and the complicated. Right. Yes.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.120
I'm tempted to sort of immediately riff, but I'll try to stay a little bit more

18:53.760 --> 18:59.360
rigorous for a moment. So, you know, as you know, this is a distinction. In my experience, I learned

18:59.520 --> 19:05.360
from Dave Snowden, although I spent enough time at the Santa Fe Institute to drink

19:05.360 --> 19:09.520
of the well of complexity directly. But the notion that complicated was definitely

19:10.640 --> 19:15.440
from him, from me. And the distinction, I think, is very profound. I would say in a particular way,

19:17.120 --> 19:24.000
it looks like a little bit of the classic map territory distinction, where the territory,

19:24.000 --> 19:30.800
the complex is fundamental. It is just sort of what's there. It's reality. And then the complicated

19:30.800 --> 19:39.440
is a thing that humans can do. We can create a model and we can control or we can foreground

19:39.440 --> 19:44.640
certain aspects of the complex by virtue of creating certain technologies. And I'll get into

19:45.200 --> 19:50.240
an example of what I mean about that in a moment. And then we can endeavor to do things like optimize

19:50.240 --> 19:56.240
for or optimize against to exclude aspects of that system. So agriculture is a classic example.

19:56.240 --> 20:01.920
You say, well, I want a whole lot of wheat. And I'm going to be able to create a control system

20:01.920 --> 20:09.200
by virtue of certain technologies like a plow and irrigation and pesticides and just the practice

20:09.200 --> 20:14.800
of understanding that wheat seeds produce wheat plants. And therefore have a much larger yield

20:14.800 --> 20:18.800
of wheat in a certain territory of land than would happen in a fashion that is

20:21.200 --> 20:26.560
how nature would do it. So that's the kind of the ticket. And what's interesting here in this

20:26.560 --> 20:33.920
distinction is that in some sense, neither Kuhn nor Tainter use this particular framework. And

20:33.920 --> 20:38.720
yet if you use this framework, you could say that they're both, they both looked at this problem

20:39.920 --> 20:44.000
in completely different ways, right? Kuhn was looking at scientific paradigms,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.520
both in terms of how they manifested in the psychologists of scientists

20:47.520 --> 20:51.200
and in how they manifested in the institutions of science. But nonetheless,

20:51.200 --> 20:57.760
he was investigating or diagnosing how complicated systems, paradigms, played out

20:58.400 --> 21:03.440
in both in terms of how they developed, how they responded to the problematic that the map is

21:03.440 --> 21:08.320
never fully the territory. And as the territory changes, or as the needs of the map change,

21:08.320 --> 21:12.560
if you're stuck with trying to make the map work, you end up with a occlusion problem.

21:13.360 --> 21:17.680
And the challenge of actually what happens when psychologists lose the fact that they're

21:17.680 --> 21:23.280
actually using maps and then mistake it for the territory. And then the flip side is that Tainter

21:23.280 --> 21:26.640
was looking at it from the point of view of anthropology, trying to discover why it was

21:26.640 --> 21:30.880
that civilizations collapsed, he called them complex societies. I would say that he was

21:30.880 --> 21:35.520
properly discussing the collapse of complicated societies, and frankly looked at a lot of the

21:35.520 --> 21:41.680
same kinds of dynamics. And so that tells us something that we are sitting in, yet another,

21:41.680 --> 21:48.000
complicated society that has a marriage to a particular set of paradigms. And both from a

21:48.000 --> 21:55.120
Tainter analysis and a Coonian analysis, all the signs point to we're reaching the end of that.

21:55.120 --> 22:00.960
And the inquiry in now is we would look like to try to consciously develop something,

22:00.960 --> 22:07.200
which is no longer simply unconsciously instantiating another form of complicated governance

22:07.200 --> 22:11.600
system, another kind of complicated society on top of it, which we may find ourselves doing

22:11.680 --> 22:16.960
willy-nilly, but it'd be wise if we could be more careful about it. But is there a way of actually

22:16.960 --> 22:22.000
creating a principled return? I'm going to use the word return specifically to the complex.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.600
So I'll give you an example. And I think you've made just pointed to it, which makes it collaborative.

22:29.840 --> 22:37.200
For a long time, certainly for the past couple of hundred years, we've been living with a

22:37.200 --> 22:44.000
false dichotomy between the state and the market as fundamental grounds of ways that

22:44.000 --> 22:50.880
societies can govern choices. And so we can either turn the dial way up via highly authoritarian,

22:52.320 --> 22:58.640
totalitarian, bureaucratic governance system, where there's an effort or an intent to govern

22:58.640 --> 23:05.760
choices to a very fine-grained level by virtue of complicated bureaucracies to be very straightforward.

23:06.320 --> 23:11.120
And I would propose, by the way, at this moment, a theoretical level that

23:13.680 --> 23:22.400
if I take the notion of the virtual or the notion of the capacity at all, the basic human

23:22.400 --> 23:28.000
capacity to do this thing, to create an abstraction, to create a model, to produce something in the

23:28.000 --> 23:33.600
realm of the virtual and then a map, and then use that to feed back on, to engage in niche

23:33.600 --> 23:38.800
construction on nature. So I'm proposing that that's a thing that we can do, and then, of course,

23:38.800 --> 23:45.200
that we do do, that it splits, in some sense, down the middle in a very interesting way.

23:45.200 --> 23:52.800
And one side of that split is the state, the realm of design, the realm of the model,

23:53.440 --> 24:01.120
the realm of cybernetic command and control systems, and to the degree to which we're investing

24:01.120 --> 24:06.400
that with authority and responsibility, we find ourselves in all the various kind of failure

24:06.400 --> 24:12.080
conditions that have been explored by those who critique the state as a form. For example,

24:12.080 --> 24:16.960
it's its limited capacity and it's limited bandwidth, and therefore, it's, you know,

24:16.960 --> 24:22.480
calculation problems, as an example. Now, here's the interesting piece for me. I would say that

24:22.480 --> 24:29.520
exact same move, that move of abstraction, also gives rise to the other side of the equation,

24:29.520 --> 24:32.960
which right now just characterizes the market, but broadly what I mean is,

24:33.840 --> 24:37.760
and I think this is, I'm just throwing this out there, but I think it's, it will prove a very

24:37.760 --> 24:46.960
interesting proposition, which is, if I take our indigenous capacities, our ordinary human

24:46.960 --> 24:57.040
capacities to engage in governance unconsciously, you know, the things that we just did for hundreds

24:57.600 --> 25:01.120
of thousands, if not millions of years, but certainly hundreds of thousands of years,

25:03.040 --> 25:09.520
in adaptive response to our natural environment. And then what we do is we inject the consequence

25:10.240 --> 25:14.880
of complicatedness, which is to say we inject the consequence of technology,

25:14.880 --> 25:19.120
whether this is physical technology or psychotechnologies, cultural technologies into the,

25:19.120 --> 25:27.680
into the mix. What we get is a random walk of our overwhelmed indigenous governance capacities,

25:28.400 --> 25:34.000
trying to navigate a landscape of accelerating innovation. Does that make sense?

25:34.000 --> 25:40.000
Yes, it does. Yes. And so this is the other problem. This is sometimes been talked about

25:40.000 --> 25:44.640
as the MOLOC problem, but I would say that quite fundamentally, it has to do with the fact, the

25:44.640 --> 25:54.160
premise, that our existing baseline indigenous governance capacities, which actually do a very

25:54.160 --> 26:05.200
fine job of navigating free paleolithic environmental niches, find themselves struggling

26:05.200 --> 26:11.200
precisely because their output, the technological consequences of those capacities, change the

26:11.280 --> 26:16.080
context that they're endeavoring to govern in a fashion that overwhelms those governance capacities.

26:16.080 --> 26:22.080
And this is the problematic of the market. Now, the meta problem is that we've found ourselves

26:22.080 --> 26:26.720
back into the corner of forgetting that these are two versions of the same basic thing.

26:27.600 --> 26:33.520
They both are versions of the complicated and that the effort to govern the failures of the

26:33.520 --> 26:38.880
market by means of the state or to govern the failures of the state by the liberations of the

26:38.880 --> 26:46.720
market are not going to work, meaning that that actually is the limited area. It's the

26:47.440 --> 26:53.600
false dichotomy that modernity has found itself stuck in the past 150 or 200 years or so.

26:54.240 --> 27:00.080
And the proposition I would make is that it is, in fact, by virtue of the rediscovery of the third

27:00.080 --> 27:06.560
term, which we've talked about is just the commons, the return of the commons, return to the complex,

27:06.560 --> 27:14.880
but now at a higher tone with a clear cut mandate to be able to resolve this problem of, in fact,

27:14.880 --> 27:20.800
specifically anthro complexity, resolve the problem of the fact that humans' capacity to

27:20.800 --> 27:26.720
feedback on our environment itself is so significant that we have to actually apply that specifically

27:26.720 --> 27:31.200
to the problem of governance so that our governance capacity is now equal to

27:32.160 --> 27:35.200
our other technical capacities to change the natural environment.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.920
Do that make any sense?

27:38.720 --> 27:41.360
Yeah, but I'm going to ask some clarification questions.

27:42.640 --> 27:52.640
So I'm trying to get at the, I guess, the crucial difference between complexity

27:53.200 --> 28:02.000
and complicated, because it seems to me that any proposal for resolving the mismatch or the

28:02.000 --> 28:07.120
misalignment between those two, which seems to be shared by both the proposal of the state

28:07.120 --> 28:12.240
running things or the market running things, depends on getting very clear on that distinction.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.840
Does that follow so far?

28:14.320 --> 28:15.440
Yeah, that sounds great.

28:15.440 --> 28:21.520
Okay, so now I'm hearing a couple of things that might be candidates,

28:21.520 --> 28:26.320
but I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not foisting any of these on you, I want to hear, right?

28:26.320 --> 28:31.520
A one candidate might be, it might just be the, the, the, a simplistic one.

28:31.520 --> 28:35.600
And I don't think you're saying this, you know, some, you can be saying something very trivial.

28:36.160 --> 28:40.000
When you say the map isn't the territory, you can be saying something trivial like, well,

28:40.000 --> 28:43.200
a representation is never identical to the thing it's represented.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.120
And that's like, yeah, that's what makes it a representation, because if it was identical,

28:47.120 --> 28:49.360
it would be an instance, not a representation.

28:49.360 --> 28:53.040
And so you're not making a, I think, a logically trivial point like that.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.480
You're trying to say something, no, though.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.640
When I'm talking about, what I hear you saying is when I'm talking about complicated is there

28:58.640 --> 29:04.960
can be any, they can be many variables and there can be many degrees of freedom,

29:04.960 --> 29:07.520
but there is no fundamental uncertainty.

29:07.520 --> 29:13.120
There may be risk, but risk is calculable and it does not possess genuine uncertainty.

29:13.120 --> 29:15.520
This is a lot of the work I'm doing on rationality now.

29:15.520 --> 29:20.720
In fact, this system, one of the ways the complex is equivocated into the complicated

29:20.720 --> 29:26.160
is by redefining uncertainty as risk, which is precisely not what uncertainty is.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.080
So you can have complicated and what you do is you do risk management.

29:30.160 --> 29:35.680
Whereas the complex says there is actual uncertainty, which are

29:38.960 --> 29:42.640
entities, process events, not captured by your variable.

29:42.640 --> 29:47.440
And you're caught in a bias variance problem when you try to track them.

29:47.440 --> 29:52.080
If you open up to too much sensitivity, you get overfitting.

29:52.080 --> 29:55.200
And if you reduce your sensitivity, you get bias.

29:55.200 --> 29:59.920
And there's no final solution to that, which means the uncertainties will always be

30:00.000 --> 30:05.520
generative. There will always be creating emergent things that slam into your complicated system.

30:05.520 --> 30:08.320
Is that a way of capturing it well?

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
Yes. That is a very good way of capturing it.

30:10.960 --> 30:16.960
I'm laughing because I was preparing myself to try to respond to your question.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.360
And as you kept going, I was like, I think you pretty much nailed it.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.320
So yes, very much so.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.560
Beautifully put. Thank you.

30:24.560 --> 30:34.320
Right. And then that means a fundamental shift from monological management into

30:34.320 --> 30:37.680
dialogical evolution. This is something you and I have talked about.

30:38.720 --> 30:43.280
What we do is no, we've got this thing, this mono system, and it manages.

30:43.280 --> 30:48.800
And we are like that. We are just monological reasoners.

30:48.800 --> 30:52.720
And we manage. And then it's that monological management.

30:52.720 --> 31:00.160
And then it's like, no, if, if complexity is not identical and can never be identified with

31:00.160 --> 31:05.920
the complicated, whatever we have over here has to be constantly in a dialogical relationship

31:05.920 --> 31:10.720
with that and constantly evolving in that relationship, as opposed to trying to monologically

31:11.280 --> 31:17.040
manage reality. It's in a dialogical responsiveness evolution with reality.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.480
Does that also part of what's following from this fight?

31:20.480 --> 31:23.920
Yes, very much so. If you think about this in the context of something like AI,

31:23.920 --> 31:30.080
it provides a nice kind of perspective to think about that, right? The, the notion that

31:32.320 --> 31:38.800
you know, no kind of finite state machine is ever actually going to be able to

31:39.840 --> 31:45.600
fully exhaust the generative possibility of emergent reality.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.480
Yeah. The way I would put this is the complicated tries to pre-specify relevance

31:51.200 --> 31:56.560
and it can't. Relevance is always within relevance realization, which is constantly evolving.

31:58.400 --> 32:08.480
And I, and I think, and I think the problem with contracts and text and laws and rules is they

32:08.480 --> 32:12.160
overestimate our capacity for pre-specifying relevance.

32:12.720 --> 32:18.080
Exactly. And this, and this gets us, so for example, the distinction between common law

32:18.080 --> 32:23.280
and civic civil code or Napoleonic code is precisely that, right? The Napoleonic code

32:23.280 --> 32:29.200
in the classic hubris of the French Revolution, right? Because they, as you said, that notion

32:29.200 --> 32:33.680
of a break, like they quite self-consciously said, we're making a complete break with all tradition.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.600
I would say just made the error. They simply, you know, maybe didn't fully understand that

32:39.600 --> 32:43.040
they were making a category error, but they made the category error of thinking that they could

32:43.840 --> 32:50.480
fully prescribe a comprehensive code of law and write it down. And then all your early

32:50.480 --> 32:54.480
job is to sort of look up on the lookup table. Oh, this is an example of that. And here's the

32:54.480 --> 32:58.480
result, right? And, you know, the point is that's actually not a valid approach.

33:00.560 --> 33:06.960
I want to emphasize that what happens is these things like constitutions function because of

33:07.040 --> 33:12.400
implicit constraints of embeddedness that have not come into the explicit prescription.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.960
For example, and Madison was very clear about this, the American constitution

33:16.960 --> 33:21.440
depended on the size of the country and the speed at which communication could work

33:21.440 --> 33:28.800
in order to it be effectively a counteract, the constitution to effectively counteract mob, right?

33:28.800 --> 33:36.160
And so the size of the country and the slowness of communication were actually presupposed in

33:36.160 --> 33:41.040
the functioning of the constitution. And those preconditions have now completely dissolved.

33:41.600 --> 33:47.440
And yet, right, that doesn't mean the constitution has been in any important way updated to take

33:47.440 --> 33:54.320
that loss of the preconditions, which are important enabling constraints into account.

33:54.880 --> 34:02.320
Right. And to kind of push that, for example, a difference between literacy writing and digital

34:02.960 --> 34:11.360
is the speed of computation. Yes. That notion of speed, like in the movement from 1776 to say

34:11.360 --> 34:19.520
1976, cars and airplanes and telephones radically increased the speed of communication,

34:19.520 --> 34:26.160
but infinitesimally compared to what happened post computation. Yes. Yes. So that's a sort of,

34:26.160 --> 34:30.000
there's a difference that makes a difference that makes a difference that's landing now.

34:30.000 --> 34:37.360
And the split or the drift between the fittedness of the enumeration of power,

34:37.360 --> 34:47.200
the enumeration institution that was valid in 1776 is increasingly no longer valid

34:47.200 --> 34:52.960
because of this kind of a difference. So I just want to take one historical lesson.

34:53.600 --> 35:01.440
And I think it's your date 1776 is really wonderful because I see Vietnam, the war in Vietnam,

35:01.440 --> 35:10.080
as the sort of realization is quite the right word, but the coming into the foreground of the

35:10.080 --> 35:14.400
fact that the country could be reached in an almost simultaneous manner through television.

35:14.400 --> 35:19.600
And therefore the political system and the political system almost breaks under the,

35:19.600 --> 35:26.000
and then you have the attempt of the government to then do various ways of controlling and

35:26.000 --> 35:32.080
centralizing the press. And then that gets blown apart again by the internet and cable and all that

35:32.080 --> 35:37.520
stuff. Right. I'm just trying to give some concrete instances so people can track

35:37.520 --> 35:43.200
the kind of thing we're talking about here. Yeah. It's useful, I would say, and maybe worth

35:43.200 --> 35:48.080
doing the explication of these two different frameworks, the notion of the implications of

35:48.400 --> 35:56.320
the media form on the possibility landscape of human choice and therefore the construct of

35:56.320 --> 36:03.200
psychology and instrumental institution necessary to enable that choice to be flowing in a coherent

36:03.200 --> 36:08.160
fashion, i.e. governance. And then the second category, right, this nation, this distinction

36:08.160 --> 36:13.760
between the complicated and the complex. But let me move for a moment into something like

36:14.240 --> 36:18.480
please some practical, some practical proposition. So given these frameworks,

36:20.400 --> 36:26.400
what are some things that we might think about that are likely going to be part of the neo-neo

36:26.400 --> 36:32.640
cortex? For example, what are the new literacies? What are the new, what might be the minimum viable

36:32.640 --> 36:38.240
capacities embodied in humans, individual humans, in any form of new model of governance?

36:38.400 --> 36:45.920
Let me just put a little bullet point on one, which is to say we're going to have to figure out the

36:45.920 --> 36:54.000
proper role of technology. I think it's relatively obvious at this point that simply allowing technology

36:54.000 --> 36:59.840
to be an unconscious producer of novelty governed effectively entirely by market and state,

37:00.560 --> 37:05.440
poorly in both cases, is no longer adequate. We actually really have to think that one of

37:05.440 --> 37:11.840
the primary questions that the neo-neo cortex needs to address is the proper role of technology.

37:13.200 --> 37:19.680
And I'd like to point out a few interesting qualities here that I'm not sure are sort of

37:21.680 --> 37:26.960
properly considered or fully considered in most discourse. One of the consequences of the era

37:26.960 --> 37:34.400
of literacy was one of the negative consequences of the era of literacy was that it had this

37:34.480 --> 37:42.080
consequence of converting humans into mediocre machines. And most of the infrastructure of

37:42.080 --> 37:50.000
education, frankly, has been precisely to do that, to embed in humans the sort of algorithmic capacity

37:50.000 --> 37:59.120
to run the complicated bureaucracies that allow governance to occur. And the easiest, best example

37:59.120 --> 38:07.200
of that, it was the notion of the calculator, which as you know, was originally a human job,

38:07.840 --> 38:11.920
particular people. So it was the word computer. The word computer was also originally applied

38:11.920 --> 38:17.360
to human beings. Human beings, there we go. So individual human beings were trained to be

38:17.680 --> 38:27.520
unreasonably or more than usual good at rapid and high fidelity

38:28.880 --> 38:35.040
calculation. And we used them to do that. And that enabled a whole big increase in bureaucratic

38:35.040 --> 38:41.200
capacity. But it has the enormous dehumanizing characteristic of vastly up regulating certain

38:41.200 --> 38:47.600
capacities out of out of all proportion to a whole human. And of course, completely ignoring

38:47.600 --> 38:52.560
all the rest of them. And so if your job was to be a calculator, you go to work and you would sort

38:52.560 --> 38:58.960
of flex a particular muscle to a high to hypertrophy. And the institution that you were

38:58.960 --> 39:02.800
part of really didn't care at all about the rest of you. In fact, to the best of its ability,

39:02.800 --> 39:08.240
tried not to. The Kafka ass nightmare. Yes. Yeah, to the point. And so I would say this is actually

39:08.800 --> 39:14.320
a consequence, first and foremost, of complicatedness. But in particular,

39:15.360 --> 39:20.160
one of the results of the institutional structures of the era of literacy. Now,

39:20.160 --> 39:26.560
what happened, of course, is that the calculator properly or the technical calculator emerged,

39:26.560 --> 39:34.240
which liberated humans from that particular role. And I mean that both earnestly, meaning it freed

39:34.240 --> 39:40.560
people from the odium of being poor machines. But I also mean, ironically, meaning it caused them

39:40.560 --> 39:46.480
to no longer have that job. And we'll get to that point in a moment. But the the era that we're

39:46.480 --> 39:54.480
entering into, particularly AI era, but also the robotics here and others, portends a tremendously

39:54.480 --> 40:00.400
larger liberation of humans from the odium of being mediocre machines. And I mean, this being

40:00.480 --> 40:06.000
accountants and being lawyers, and frankly, in many cases, mean doctors, including and up to all

40:06.000 --> 40:11.520
the other kinds of things that people do. And this begs an interesting question, which is, one,

40:13.440 --> 40:18.000
how do we avoid the the inverse of that, which to say, how do we avoid the catastrophe of everybody

40:18.000 --> 40:25.600
being unemployed? And then two, at the limit, what does that mean? Like what role do human beings play

40:25.600 --> 40:32.080
in a world where so many things that human beings used to do are now being held vastly

40:32.080 --> 40:38.800
more effectively by machines? And so the role of technology, those are some of the most fundamental

40:38.800 --> 40:44.720
questions. And any new form of governance needs to address, particularly those two questions.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.120
Well, we'll just say three, the three primary questions, which is,

40:49.680 --> 40:55.200
how do we navigate the problem that our existing institutional structure

40:57.040 --> 41:02.720
is premised around people only being able to meet their physical material needs by virtue of doing

41:02.720 --> 41:08.560
certain kinds of work that are going to become obsolete relatively soon and relatively too

41:08.560 --> 41:15.280
rapidly to try to do this retraining thing effectively. So that's one, I call I've called

41:15.360 --> 41:22.720
up the coming great economic transition. Two, how do we do so in a fashion which ennobles the human

41:22.720 --> 41:30.240
spirit? You know, something like a, we're all on the on the dole of the UBI, let's call it the UBI

41:30.240 --> 41:36.480
nightmare, or the negative form of that, where everybody is sort of wandering around in the

41:36.480 --> 41:43.680
soul destroying swamp that destroys people when they win the lottery is a is a is a fail fail

41:43.680 --> 41:47.360
condition in a catastrophic way. And so we have to figure out that as well. Like, how do we

41:47.360 --> 41:53.680
simultaneously migrate people to where they are properly liberated from the odium of being poor

41:53.680 --> 41:58.720
machines, but actually liberated into a proper human role in the world? And what does that look

41:58.720 --> 42:03.120
like? What is that? I would say, by the way, that it's making effective choices, that that's our

42:03.120 --> 42:08.640
most fundamental thing. And that to become virtuous is directly related to that, but we'll get to

42:08.640 --> 42:16.320
that in a moment. Okay, so let me let me then I've got two more bullet points that I think are

42:16.320 --> 42:19.440
useful to put into the question about those first two, because I think there's a

42:22.320 --> 42:26.080
I mean, of course, so there's been there's been analogues to this, they're not the same. So that's

42:26.080 --> 42:32.880
why I'm using the word analog, right? So you get the displacement of the farmer in ancient,

42:33.760 --> 42:39.440
in the Roman Republic, and in the Empire by the slave. And then you get the drift into the city

42:39.440 --> 42:46.080
and you get the permanently unemployed living on the dole of the government, right? And then what

42:46.080 --> 42:51.840
you have is you have the problem of the mob, which is I think is very analogous to what you're

42:51.840 --> 42:59.840
proposing. And then the solution, of course, was the bread and circuses solution and then the pageantry

42:59.920 --> 43:07.040
of the God King in order to distract people. And my concern is that it's not just a problem of

43:07.040 --> 43:11.840
prescience you're pointing to, but there's also a problem of competition that all of these other

43:11.840 --> 43:20.160
factors of entertainment, bread and circuses and God Kings is also already being adopted

43:20.160 --> 43:29.120
as a prevalent and pervasive strategy for dealing with what you're pointing to. So it's not just

43:29.200 --> 43:35.040
that there's something coming of which we are not prepared. It seems to me it's already occurring

43:35.040 --> 43:41.600
and noxious elements that will thwart any real solution already have significant power and influence.

43:41.600 --> 43:47.600
So I'm just trying to amplify what you're saying. Yeah, I don't, the way that you speak does not

43:47.600 --> 43:53.680
allow the kind of aesthetics of firebrand to be voiced upon you, but that was a very firebrandy

43:53.680 --> 43:59.680
thing you just said, which with which I agree profoundly. So I'll put it in a slightly different

43:59.680 --> 44:04.560
way, I think. And by the way, if I'm putting it in a way that is not harmonious with what you just

44:04.560 --> 44:12.640
said, you can obviously put the blame for that on me. The poor experts, I'm going to make a

44:12.640 --> 44:19.200
distinction between expertise and competence, the poor experts who have been given, and in some

44:19.200 --> 44:26.000
sense taken, authority and responsibility for governance, the technocracy. When faced with

44:26.560 --> 44:30.400
the contemporary version of the Roman problematic that you just described,

44:32.240 --> 44:37.840
seemed to have no other recourse than to implement a contemporary version of the same tools

44:38.400 --> 44:46.160
the Romans implemented. So perhaps instead of lions and gladiators, we're currently using

44:46.880 --> 44:52.960
Netflix and are exploring how we might use VR in the metaverse, but it's the same thing.

44:54.000 --> 45:02.320
And so, and the point I would make when I say the poor experts is that they never had a chance

45:04.160 --> 45:10.560
that the notion of expertise is one of the things that is, I would say, part of the notion of

45:10.560 --> 45:18.240
complicatedness and isn't the right kind of thing. Yeah, expertise is a domain specific term,

45:18.240 --> 45:23.840
not a domain general term. And interestingly enough is the kind of thing that machines

45:23.840 --> 45:30.000
will be very much better at. Yes, already in many ways. Many ways and increasingly. And this other

45:30.000 --> 45:37.920
category or other thing that I'll simply call competence is what will replace it. And by the

45:37.920 --> 45:46.560
way, yes, and I also define competence as awareness, sensitivity to the whole context

45:47.280 --> 45:52.960
that is under investigation. So as an example of what this new governance model looks like,

45:54.080 --> 46:02.560
it is composed of holes that are deeply contextually governed. And so instead of

46:02.640 --> 46:10.880
WHLE, by the way, WHLE, yes, rather than a disciplinary structure that endeavors to

46:10.880 --> 46:18.560
analytically break worlds into discrete domains, which then one can produce expertise in,

46:19.440 --> 46:24.560
and then endeavor to govern in a complicated fashion using some form of bureaucratic institution.

46:25.840 --> 46:29.440
And the new form of governance, which by the way is the same as the old form of governance,

46:29.440 --> 46:35.680
but now hopefully more robust. We actually are aware of the fact that context matters,

46:35.680 --> 46:40.720
that all parts are parts of holes and deeply subtle and oftentimes very difficult to notice

46:40.720 --> 46:48.640
fashions. And that the new competence involves a capacity to be in relationship with the sort

46:48.640 --> 46:53.920
of the intrinsics of a well integrated whole, let's say for example, a river system,

46:54.800 --> 47:01.120
which fully implicates all of the other things, both in terms of nested holes, like the river

47:01.120 --> 47:07.680
system is part of both a water system and a air system, for example, and a biological system,

47:07.680 --> 47:14.160
the presence of beavers significantly changes the notion of how rivers work. And the new,

47:14.160 --> 47:21.840
the competence I am defining as a new sort of literacy or a new capacity in governance is both

47:21.840 --> 47:27.760
awareness, what I just, the fact that I just pointed out, I that it is a whole and also

47:27.760 --> 47:32.880
the fact that all holes implicate a variety of other kinds of holes in highly subtle

47:33.840 --> 47:41.520
context sensitive ways, which is radically different from the kind of thing a that expertise

47:41.520 --> 47:46.960
could ever do, and therefore be that even extremely sophisticated AI systems could ever do.

47:47.680 --> 47:56.640
I fundamentally agree. In fact, it's always amazing to me how much our projects

47:57.360 --> 48:06.400
resonantly converge. I mean, the whole project, one of the main thrusts of the

48:06.400 --> 48:12.880
platonic dialogues with Socrates is to get people to make this move, to move them off

48:12.960 --> 48:18.640
authority or intuition to expertise, and then say, but nevertheless, expertise is not wisdom,

48:18.640 --> 48:22.800
and you do this sort of double move, and you're trying to get people be like you got trying to

48:22.800 --> 48:29.360
get them post expertise in the understanding of what wisdom is. And then of course, you have in

48:29.360 --> 48:39.840
that the platonic tonus, the stereoscopic commitment to we are always finite, we're always in the

48:39.840 --> 48:46.080
finitary predicament, but we are always oriented towards transcendence, we are all we are oriented

48:46.080 --> 48:51.280
towards the whole, right, the synoptic integration. And if we lose either one of these, we fall into

48:51.280 --> 48:56.800
tyranny or servitude, and we have to hold the two together, and that that is a domain general thing,

48:56.800 --> 49:01.600
and it's not an extra, it's not something for which there can be an expertise. And ultimately,

49:01.600 --> 49:05.920
we can only properly love it, we can never possess it. Because if we think we possess it,

49:05.920 --> 49:11.360
then we've converted it back into expertise, etc, etc. All of this is so I mean, and that's

49:11.360 --> 49:17.280
of course what I'm trying to tease out, and turn into practice with the After Socrates project is

49:18.480 --> 49:25.760
exactly that what you're calling competence that that but to me, that is the ancient platonic

49:25.760 --> 49:31.200
call to the love of wisdom. Well, let's let's double click on that. So what I'd like to do is

49:31.200 --> 49:39.760
I'd also now like to officially, they claim to the meaning of the term sovereignty. I feel that it

49:39.760 --> 49:49.360
has been I'm a squatter, it's been it's been left under occupied. And by force measure, I'm claiming

49:49.360 --> 49:56.400
it. Okay, let me define what I mean by it, please. So I'm going to kind of walk around a little bit

49:56.400 --> 50:03.360
because I feel like I want to poke a few things. One of the things I've noticed about the American

50:04.160 --> 50:14.160
constitutional frame, that I believe is a fundamental flaw, is that it largely defines itself

50:14.960 --> 50:22.080
by virtue of a negative space in relationship to the monarchy with which it was struggling.

50:23.040 --> 50:31.440
So the nation of liberty represents the degree to which an aristocracy has

50:32.560 --> 50:43.040
right to limit the power of monarchy. This conception of liberty therefore intrinsically

50:43.040 --> 50:50.240
implies a tyranny that is resistance against. Yeah, it's a freedom from the Berlin talks about

50:50.320 --> 50:57.120
exactly. And unfortunately, therefore, as your various institutions that are endeavoring to

50:58.000 --> 51:06.240
propose or hold liberty degrade as institutions are want to do, interestingly enough, the tyranny

51:06.240 --> 51:12.640
that was held at the shadow, but nonetheless held in the story will raise its ugly face.

51:13.120 --> 51:21.600
That's one way of this. I'm putting that out there because the notion of sovereignty that we have

51:21.600 --> 51:28.080
received is equivalent, meaning it is largely described as a negative freedom. And I would say

51:28.080 --> 51:36.000
that both the concept of the sovereign state and in a meaningful sense, the sovereign individual,

51:36.000 --> 51:42.960
I mean by that in a moment, are in fact nonsense. The state cannot be sovereign per se. And that

51:42.960 --> 51:48.080
is because the conception of sovereignty that is endeavor to be used is not coherent.

51:50.880 --> 51:57.280
And that the sovereign individual, which is understood as the next step of the breaking

51:57.280 --> 52:02.400
down of the kind of sovereignty that is described when we talk about the state as sovereign. So

52:02.400 --> 52:07.280
we say we take the concept of sovereignty that we're using when we think of the sovereign state

52:07.280 --> 52:11.040
and we simply replace the word state with the word individual. So we see a sovereign

52:11.040 --> 52:18.560
in that sense. This is also incoherent. Okay. So what do I think is a coherent meaning for the

52:18.560 --> 52:24.800
concept of sovereignty? What I mean is this, do you mean incoherent because it's largely negative

52:25.680 --> 52:30.080
negatively defined and it doesn't have any internal coherency holding it together? Is that what

52:30.080 --> 52:37.360
you mean? Okay, good. It exists only by virtue of describing something that it is in resistance

52:37.360 --> 52:42.400
against. Like the way in the Cold War, freedom became freedom from communism. And then when

52:42.400 --> 52:47.680
communism sort of ends, the notion of freedom becomes sort of unmoored and people realize

52:47.680 --> 52:51.440
that it's incoherent. It has many different equivocal meanings floating around. Something

52:51.440 --> 52:58.240
like that just by analogy. Very nice analogy. Okay. So from the inverse, from the center out,

52:58.960 --> 53:03.040
and this is something I talked about at least an amount like five years ago, but I haven't

53:03.040 --> 53:10.080
brought it up recently. The notion of sovereignty means the capacity to make effective choices

53:10.080 --> 53:15.360
in a given context. We can explicate what I mean by effective choice, but for the moment,

53:15.360 --> 53:21.840
I'll just leave that. But the point there is twofold. And by the way, the notion of sovereignty

53:21.840 --> 53:29.200
therefore resonates very strongly with the broader notion of virtue, which is to say that a

53:30.160 --> 53:36.640
being that has sovereignty is a being that also has a deep embodiment of a diverse number of

53:36.640 --> 53:43.360
virtues in particular in relationship to a given context. And so one cannot be sovereign in essence

53:43.360 --> 53:49.680
unless you're speaking about perhaps the notion of God as you discussed with Bishop Maximus,

53:49.680 --> 53:55.520
which I will not get into this moment. But finite beings are sovereign in the context of an actual

53:55.520 --> 54:00.720
context. And that could be as trivial as sovereign in the context of making wood burn into a fire,

54:01.360 --> 54:08.000
or as fundamental as sovereign in the context of say parenting, or in the context of

54:08.000 --> 54:13.600
stewarding a community in relationship with multi generations and the nature that they live in and

54:13.600 --> 54:20.480
on. But the point is very simple, and it connects very nicely with the notion of competence, meaning

54:21.120 --> 54:27.360
I have a set of capacities, which include appropriate perception and sensitivities,

54:28.240 --> 54:35.840
heuristics and tools, which can operate at the appropriate rate to perceive the relevant aspects,

54:35.840 --> 54:41.360
I'm talking about robust relevance realization and actuation, to perceive the relevant aspects of

54:41.360 --> 54:50.240
the context that I find myself in. And then I have the capacities to select appropriate choices

54:50.880 --> 54:56.320
that, and then to actuate them elegantly, meaning using the constraints of energy and

54:58.400 --> 55:00.880
the actual constraints of the environment that I'm in.

55:01.440 --> 55:05.040
High cost opportunity costs, all that kind of stuff. Yes, all that kind of stuff.

55:06.000 --> 55:13.840
To further my capacity to make choices in the next moment that I find myself in.

55:13.840 --> 55:20.560
So the metaphor that I often use is surfing, meaning if I am sovereign in the context of

55:20.560 --> 55:26.480
surfing, what that means is that I have a surfboard and I know how to surf. And in this particular

55:26.480 --> 55:32.400
wave, I have the physical acumen to be able to paddle into it and drop into it. And then moment

55:32.480 --> 55:36.800
to moment, I can make the micro movements of my body in relationship with the unfolding

55:36.800 --> 55:42.240
reality of the complexity of the wave, which of course is itself a deeply complex relationship

55:42.240 --> 55:47.280
with the energy of the wave, the winds and the subsurface and subsurface topography of the ocean.

55:47.920 --> 55:54.640
So as to continue to find myself in that unique location of wave, such that my board is still

55:54.640 --> 55:59.680
locked into the pocket and I continue to surf. And I can expand that out. So when I say

56:00.640 --> 56:02.800
but yeah, I want to stop there because I want to probe on this because

56:04.160 --> 56:08.720
I want to make sure well, I'll propose something of what I think I might be hearing.

56:09.840 --> 56:15.200
So it sounds to me like sovereignty, the sovereign, I'll just I'm going to use the word

56:15.200 --> 56:19.360
individual in a very generic sense, the sovereign individual because I don't necessarily mean a

56:19.360 --> 56:27.680
human person. The sovereign individual is a species of a cognitive agent. So everything behaves

56:27.680 --> 56:33.440
but agents are different from behaviors and that agents can determine the consequences of

56:33.440 --> 56:38.960
their behavior and alter the behavior in order to bring about desired consequences. And they

56:38.960 --> 56:44.240
have desired consequences because they are autonomous, auto poetic entities, they're a

56:44.240 --> 56:50.720
self making entity. And so a paramecium is properly, very properly an agent. Now, I'm

56:50.720 --> 56:55.440
wondering if you would extend the notion of sovereignty to a paramecium. And if not, just

56:55.440 --> 56:59.840
let me finish. If not, then when I'm when I'm hearing when you invoke things like virtue,

56:59.840 --> 57:04.880
because I don't know if we could talk about the virtue of paramecium, I think we're moving into

57:04.880 --> 57:10.320
the idea of an Aristotelian idea. And that's not that's meant to be a compliment, right,

57:10.320 --> 57:19.760
that a sovereign is an agent that has has reflectively appropriated its agency in order to

57:19.760 --> 57:26.160
further enhance its agency, by to some degree, explicating and reflecting upon the machinery

57:26.160 --> 57:33.680
of its agency, and recursively intervening in its agency in order to enhance its agentic

57:33.680 --> 57:39.520
capacity, not just to achieve this goal or that goal, but to enhance its overall capacity to

57:39.520 --> 57:44.960
achieve goals per se. Does that work as a proposal? Yes, this works very nice. Now,

57:45.440 --> 57:51.200
in my own sort of kluge vocabulary, I meet the distinction between lowercase s and capital s.

57:52.400 --> 57:59.360
And so I would say that a paramecium is lowercase s sovereign, that the the human journey and its

57:59.360 --> 58:08.640
relationship with the theological journey is the capital s. And here I'm very much inspired by the

58:08.640 --> 58:13.360
conversations that you have with Jonathan Paggio in relationship with things like symbolism. Yes,

58:14.320 --> 58:21.600
that it's a vector, right, when we cannot ever achieve in this world, capital s sovereignty as

58:21.600 --> 58:28.160
a finished state, as you've said, but rather it is a relationship with life and relationship with

58:28.160 --> 58:36.080
self that has a directionality to it, a very, very, very precise directionality. But it is

58:36.080 --> 58:41.200
unfolding in continuity. And that's part of the nature of the journey that we're all as humans.

58:43.360 --> 58:49.440
So we find ourselves in a very interesting point. I would say that there's a lowercase sovereignty

58:49.440 --> 58:54.240
that goes down to the limits of agency, right? So I'm not going to be opining around the kind of

58:54.240 --> 58:59.200
a the place where Stuart Kaufman spent so much time, you know, it's a autocatalytic chemistry

58:59.200 --> 59:05.360
sovereign, maybe, but there's a limit where paramecium, and most specifically in my example,

59:05.360 --> 59:12.800
something like say heart cell is lowercase s. And what we find is that in particular,

59:12.800 --> 59:21.680
these lower level holes or elements achieve a level of sovereignty in relationship with

59:21.680 --> 59:27.120
other elements around things that are properly well integrated holes. What I mean is, for example,

59:27.120 --> 59:35.040
an organ like a heart or a liver is a gathering together of lower scale lowercase s sovereigns

59:35.680 --> 59:44.080
in a fashion that delivers a higher scale lowercase s sovereignty over a more complex domain.

59:44.080 --> 59:48.960
Yeah, this is John, John Stuart's idea about although there's no teleology in evolution,

59:48.960 --> 59:54.000
there's a gradient shift towards what he calls increasing entification, in which you get previously

59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.240
autonomous things form a hole that is able is not that gives results that are not just the sum

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.560
of the parts and therefore you get this evolutionary advantage. And you get you get these building

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:09.200
up and he's proposing that we need, I don't know if you've seen any of the conversations I've had

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:14.480
with him, but he's proposing that we need to really ramp up the entification of distributed

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:25.360
cognition into something that we can really clearly see as having a designated role in

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:31.440
governance to use your language. Yes, yes, in fact, I recently did a conversation with a young man in

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:39.600
I think he's German, very young man, but he has ruled out a proposal that I would say is precisely

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.680
this kind of thing like an entification of distributed cognition with a lot of very nice

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:48.880
thoughts. So a lot of the embodiment, a lot of the actual he calls it incarnation, which I quite like

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.240
of this new form of governance, I think is largely about that. So let me give you a concrete

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.200
example in a different view of something that you and I have been doing a lot of and this notion

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:07.280
of the logos. So we have two distinct elements to it. And I actually, I'll add a third, which is

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:14.560
always going to be there. One is we have the notion of something like lowercase sovereignty

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:22.400
between communicating agents in relationship with the capacity to engage in creating a

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.000
communications channel. All right. And let me just kind of step back a bit. So the problem we're

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.440
dealing with is that the problem of distributed cognition, the problem of communication between

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:39.840
two humans, I'll just make it simple at that point. In the past, say for the past 250 years,

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:45.760
has been governed by something like paradigmatic structures, where we have things like well

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.240
defined terms, and we have things like shared disciplinary knowledge. And what happens is

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.680
that we sort of have a dictionary of well defined terms. You can feel like the resonance of

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:03.280
complicatedness here. And the game is actually pretty simple. Either I understand the term,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.880
or I have to learn the term. So I join a discipline, I become a doctor, and I learn what, you know,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.600
some esoteric medical term happens to mean, once I have achieved a level of expertise in

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.920
that particular language, I can then communicate with other members of that community. Now,

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:23.120
that's how we have solved this problem in paradigmatic space. And the problem of digital

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.440
is that we now have something like 8 billion distinct humans all operating in a vast space

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:36.240
of developing novel relationships with novel increasingly novel realities. And all paradigmatic

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:42.960
dictionaries now kind of fail, meaning the interaction I have with somebody on Twitter,

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.760
the ability for us to diagnose whether or not we're actually part of a preexisting

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.160
institutional structure and are actually using the same code book to define certain terms.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.040
Things are happening too rapidly. And by the way, the meaning of terms is changing too rapidly

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.640
for that paradigmatic model to work. So we need a new code.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.080
I'm guilty of this mistake as well.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.000
Yeah.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.320
But we actually need a new fundamental protocol, which assumes that we don't know what we're

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.320
talking about that assumes more or less that we actually don't have a shared vocabulary.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.680
That's so Socratic through and through. It really is.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.280
Yeah, it is. Okay. So think about the Socratic, the implication, right? There's really

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.480
three elements. One element is we need to have something like a protocol. Like how do we actually

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.040
do this? And by the way, I'm using the word protocol both because it's something that Indigenous

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.080
communities have used for a long time in terms of how to distinct groups who don't know each other,

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.200
go through the process of actually coming into relationship with each other, which is exactly

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.840
we're talking about. It's the upper Paleolithic. It's the original upper Paleolithic problem, right?

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.800
And of course, symbolism and shamanism were plausibly part of the solution to that original

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.400
version of the problem. I just want to throw that into the mix. Keep going.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.120
I have a very, very poor historical theory that I operate with and exactly how that works,

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.640
but I won't throw that out there now because it's super non-rigorous. But you know, I like it.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.160
But in any event, we need a protocol. And the other side of protocol that in the technical

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.360
world we use, of course, is technical protocol, like the internet protocol, like IP. And if we

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.200
think about that, I don't know if you're old enough to remember, remember the old dial-up modem

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.160
and the way that it worked? If you think about it, every single sound that it made actually was a

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:33.280
physical instantiation of a certain stage of the protocol that actually builds up the process of

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:38.000
moving from, are we able to communicate at all? Are we both the kinds of things that have the

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.240
potential to communicate? Up through a series of things that they call handshakes of saying,

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.800
okay, well, great. You're the kind of thing that communicates. Neat. Let me make a proposal of how

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.040
we might communicate. Oh, you agree. Cool. Now, we're going to use that to bootstrap the next

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:58.560
level to the next level until eventually, you know, I can transmit AOL over a 56K connection

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.960
on top of twisted copper telephone wires, which is a pretty profound thing. We're talking about

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:08.560
the same kind of thing, right? Every time two individual humans connect via social media,

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:15.120
we're actually implicitly engaging in that kind of action poorly. Yes. So the new form of governance

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.280
is going to have to actually do that properly. We'll have a process whereby we can actually

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:26.640
identify where are we in some kind of well-defined stack of relationality and then have a process,

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.360
a protocol, for establishing a communications channel through which we can then engage in

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.680
building a context of relationality. Okay. So let me make sure I'm hearing you right. So one of the

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:45.280
central tasks of the new government, new governance, not new government, that was a slip, new governance

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:54.240
is to replace poor product protocol with proper protocol. Yes. Okay. Yes. And in a second, I'm

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.640
going to bring back one of the primary components of proper protocol. But for right now, I'm going to

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:07.280
say the second kind of capacity is competence in implementing that protocol. So to be sovereign

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:14.640
in relationship with communication. And you've actually put tremendous amount of effort into

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:19.200
that sort of thing in the context of things like what does a human being have to have as sort of

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.480
basic human capabilities to engage in dialogues? Right. Yeah. A simple example is one that I've

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:31.600
taken from my friend, Benita Roy, she taught me, was the notion of mapping error or the one that

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.640
you call that often, which has to do with disambiguation or noticing what there is.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.720
Now, what's the word that you used to describe it? When a meaning is not clear.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.480
Like equivocal?

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:50.720
equivocal. Exactly. You know, a new literacy is to have a psychological awareness of the fact

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.160
that terms can be equivocal. And that quite often, if you are communicating with somebody,

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.880
and their use of a term doesn't make any sense to you, you are likely dealing with an equivocation,

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.360
or perhaps even distinct linguistic histories, where they're using that word to mean something

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.760
completely differently, because it is embodied in a very different lineage context. And having,

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.480
for example, an emotional response of curiosity, and the ability to activate a disambiguation

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:19.760
protocol, as opposed to an emotional response of wanting to punch them in the face or cancel them,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.080
for example. Right. You know, in the current environment, because we're operating using

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:31.680
very broken indigenous, you know, human tribal familial capacities to engage in this

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.960
random walkthrough innovation space, we find ourselves in the unspeakably novel context

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:42.640
of endeavoring to communicate with human beings that we've never met, are currently interacting

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.960
with in embodied fashion, via principally just small amounts of text, and therefore oftentimes

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.240
make mistakes, like we get really angry when they say something that doesn't sound right to us.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.800
Okay. And you get the reverse error that people try to communicate the wrong kind of thing

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.240
in a medium. They try to communicate a philosophical argument on Twitter, which is a disaster.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.840
Which is a disaster, exactly. And by the way, it goes all the way down. Like my wife and I

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:17.760
being very nerdy, have many times had the conversation of, to me, darling, that particular

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.840
question that you're asking is not appropriately asked while you're driving in the car using text.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.400
Yeah. Yeah. We should wait, like, you know, until we have an interpersonal face to face to

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.560
have that conversation, because that's the appropriate communications context to have

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.560
that particular kind of relationality. So let me loop back to the notion of what a proper protocol

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.280
ultimately unfolds into. A proper protocol creates the appropriate communications context

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.680
to then begin the embodiment of the proper relational context that has the right sort

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:57.520
of richness and sensitivity and nuance to instantiate a wholeness that we can build

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:04.000
then a relational competence that can hold whatever it is we're actually going to be dealing with.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.320
I see what you mean now. I mean, the workshops where we take people through meditation,

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:16.720
contemplation, the circling practices into the philosophical fellowship. And then we do all

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:23.840
of that to build up that protocol. Right. And then we, the people are introduced to dialectic

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:32.160
into deologos. Exactly. And let me tell you, my study of this tells me that just getting that part

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:41.120
right will resolve 80% of the problems we're currently dealing with. It is profound what

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.240
happens if we just get the combination of a proper protocol, which has this very specific

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:50.720
element of understanding that communication context that develops proper relationality

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.040
and humans who are sovereign in the context of those two pieces. If we get that element together,

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.000
multiplied by the fact that we actually do have 8 billion agentic minds that are just sort of

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.040
radically being underutilized, lots of good stuff happens and lots of bad stuff goes away.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.920
Okay. So that's one example of what this new Neo-Neocortex looks like. Let me give you a

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.040
different example. And then I think we may have actually been kind of running out of time, which is

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.040
nice. It feels like we've done some really good stuff. Well, I think we've laid the

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:26.800
foundations for the series very well. Yeah. So I mean, lay this other one down,

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.920
because I feel like it's potent. And I noticed that it confused, actually, Schmacktenberger,

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:37.600
when I talked with him about it about a year and a half ago, it didn't land then. And I'm not sure

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:45.600
if it ever really did. So if we think about an old fashioned notion of government, and we'll all

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:53.200
just use the American way of doing it, we ended up dividing it into three distinct domains, the

01:10:53.200 --> 01:11:02.160
executive, the legislative, and the juridical. Here's my proposition. My proposition is that the

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:13.680
move into the digital has, as a primary element, a radical releasing of energies, let's say,

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:22.480
that have been unduly bound into this location of being a false machine. In other words,

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:31.760
the civic code. We made a mistake of binding too much into algorithms and binding too much into

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.760
humans running bureaucracies and things like that. And then the move into the digital liberates that

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.440
tremendously. We talked about that a moment ago in terms of liberating human energy that we no

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:46.320
longer have to be calculators. But I mean the same thing in the context of these higher order

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.200
abstractions of governance. And specifically what I mean is, the notion of the function of the

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:58.480
legislative, of which, by the way, the regulatory is a subsidiary, is radically displaced in the new

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:07.120
form of governance, that the era of literacy was the crowning of the legislative, and that's no

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:16.400
longer either needed or necessary or proper. That the era of the digital involves a radically

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:25.040
reduction, a radical reduction of the legislative function, and a restoration of the juridical

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:30.880
function. Which, by the way, completely changes the location of the executive function, but I

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.080
don't think we have time to get there. And what I discovered when I was thinking about this is a

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:41.920
really beautiful notion of revival. And I think you may have actually been the one who put it in my

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.480
head, or maybe Bishop Maximus, because I'm thinking about Exodus, and I'm thinking about Moses.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.400
And I'm thinking about topology. So, in the story of Moses, who played a very interesting

01:12:54.400 --> 01:13:01.120
role. Moses played the role of governance in the context of the Jews traveling across the

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:10.240
desert as the direct interface to God. But he played the role of judge, not the role of king.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.640
There were many judges. There's a whole book of the Bible.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:23.200
Yeah, that transition is the key. That tells me, to the story of the Torah,

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.280
let's say the Old Testament, that the notion of judge is more fundamental. It is the proper

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:34.720
location of where the heart of governance is. Meaning, it's how you steward the commons,

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.760
and think about how commons' law works. Oh, I see. This is very interesting.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.200
Jeritical. Commons' law. Jeritical. What does that mean? What that means is

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:55.280
wisdom. We use wisdom to resolve disputes, as opposed to endeavoring to codify

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:04.080
choice, create constraints in bureaucracies to govern choice. We rather recognize that sovereign

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:09.920
human beings, and I mean this in both senses in the term now, are making choices locally at the

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:14.720
lowest level on the ground with the highest degree of a perception of what's really happening, and

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:20.480
the highest degree of the ability to ultimately express their values into world by themselves,

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:26.080
like in small self-organizing groups. And that the biggest challenge, the most fundamental

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.520
challenge of governance, beyond, by the way, communication, which we just covered, is resolving

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.440
conflict, where these groups of individuals and groups of individuals find themselves noticing

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:43.840
that their sovereignty is not adequate to the scope of the wholeness that they are in relationship with.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.720
And therefore, we need to have individuals who are notably wise and are arranged in such a way.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:15:00.560
When Moses was counseled to make subsidiarity a principle and grant

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.320
juridical authority to a constellation of judges besides himself,

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:11.200
it was done fractally at different levels of scale, all the way down to, I believe, 10,

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.440
which is really neat to think about that granularly. But the two rules were that the

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.960
individuals were wise and they were not corruptible, and they were not likely to be

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.560
off, meaning that their interests were aligned with both the individuals that they were interacting

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:28.720
with personally and with the larger whole, and they had a competence, they had a sovereignty

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.560
that was adequate to the responsibility that they were holding. Well, that's that. And so

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:40.480
this is there's two moves here. One move is the removal of the legislative as the center or the

01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:45.120
more fundamental notion of governance, which is the same thing as the removal of the bureaucratic

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:52.720
or the algorithmic. And the second is the restoration of a subsidiarity or a fractal,

01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:01.920
wisdom based commons law that is principally around developing highly context aware. Remember the

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:08.320
notion of the legislature has to do with the abstraction of trying to create general rules

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:11.680
that are as relevant to particular contexts as they can be.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:20.880
Prespecify. Yes, I get it. Context aware. Whereas a fine grained common law is precisely

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:28.160
context aware. It is a conflict between two real situated humans in a real actual environment that

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.280
has real actual consequences for all the other people in the nature with which they're in relationship.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:41.280
And a proper judge has proper responsibility for addressing the whole thing.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.440
It may be that X is the right thing to do instead of Y. And that's the judge's job. And then we want

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:55.200
to do is we want to build the right kind of meta context such that the judges aren't corrupt,

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.680
that the judges are there, that they're wise. And by wise, I actually mean both that they actually

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:04.080
have real sovereignty in relationship to the context they have responsibility for, but also

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.040
that they're actually embedded, meaning that they're legitimate in the Habermasian sense.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:15.360
Does that make sense? Yeah, so far it does. So I mean, two questions emerge. One is,

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.240
why did the Israel, I mean, I'm going to use the mythological language. I'm asking a general

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:27.280
question, but why did the Israelites want to replace the judges with kings? Because that seems

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:33.360
to be a question that needs to be answered. And I think there's a related question, which is,

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:39.120
how do we deal with the Promethean spirit, which regards tradition as something to be overcome

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:48.560
because we emphasize the progress into the new? And how do we keep that distinct from the openness

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:56.400
to emergence? That for me is a pressing problem right now, right? You want to be beholding to

01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:02.480
the tradition, but you don't want to fall into being a traditionalist. You want to be somebody

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:10.720
who is open to emergence without pronouncing death on the, commit it to the flames of the tradition.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.320
And then thirdly, you have Plato's problem. Who's going to guard the guardians? The philosopher

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:21.440
kings are very much Plato's attempt to get something like the judges. And of course,

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.320
it did happen. We had Marcus Aurelius. But the thing that's interesting there is it took,

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:32.720
it took non-constitutional constraints, a bunch of gay emperors that adopted their errors,

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.160
bunch of errors from which they then chose the most competent, really in your sense,

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:42.560
in order for it to work. And of course, Plato didn't have a solution to that problem,

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:48.960
and he kept wrestling with it. And many people, in fact, argue that the republic is,

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.000
and I agree with this, is a profound critique of any utopic proposals.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.920
So that would be the three questions, and maybe those can be the questions we could

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:06.160
pursue next time. Yeah, can I just address a little bit of the first, just kind of put a hook,

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.000
and then I think it's exactly right for us to do the rest next time, because it feels to me like

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.080
that's a, what I'd like to do is invoke and open a proper space of deologous on that question.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.200
Yes, yes, totally. It goes without saying that's a quite a potent question. All right,

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.120
so the first, I will put this out here, and I think it creates some pretty good hooks. And the

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.000
regional question, the first question was, why did the Israelites go from judges to kings?

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:37.760
Here's why, I think. I will say it with some assertiveness. The executive function,

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:44.960
which is fundamentally the king, and remember, for example, in medieval Europe, the king played

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:50.960
both the role of judge, like juridical functions grounded in the king, and the judges who traveled

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:57.680
around and implemented common law were direct reports to the king, and also played the military

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.360
function, here's the thing. The executive function, which is to say the enforcement of the law,

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:12.960
in a well constituted community, is an intrinsic of the juridical function. Let me make that

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:19.680
explicit. So let's say we have a group of 10 people, and they all know each other, like they're all

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.360
in real relationship, and they've all identified a given individual as wise, which is to say that

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:30.880
individual has high legitimacy. They all trust this person as wise and well-intentioned with regard

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.680
to both each individual and to the larger group as a whole. So a properly created community,

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.440
when a conflict emerges between members of that community, and eventually becomes something that

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:50.240
is subject to juridical evaluation, the wise elder will opine on it, will speak with wisdom and

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:58.320
clarity, and if done well, if they actually have done a proper job, that it's self-enforcing, meaning

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:05.600
that the one person, for example, or perhaps the two people in conflict, who may or may not be super

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.520
awesome, happy with the results of the judgment, have aid other people in the community, that

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:16.000
they're in very deep complex relationship with, who are all sort of looking at them and saying,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.480
look, this is how we do it here. And wisdom has spoken, and honestly, it sounds pretty fucking

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:24.640
wise. So I don't know what problem you've got with it, but get in line. It's self-enforcing,

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.280
because the community actually has proper scale, meaning there's not too many people involved,

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:36.320
and it has proper verticality, that the wisdom is legitimate. Now, we have two problems that emerge.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.720
One is when you're dealing with war, when you're actually dealing with problems where many of your

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:48.960
disputes don't have a shared sense of wisdom. When I have a dispute with a neighboring tribe,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:55.120
let's say the Philistines, and I don't have any shared elder, we can resolve those disputes in

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:02.720
the fashion I just described, we resolve disputes using war, and war is king, not judge. And what

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.680
happened to the ancient Israelites is that the day they left the desert, and they entered the land

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:14.160
of milken honey, they immediately entered into war, and therefore left the realm of judge qua

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.280
judge, and entered the realm of king qua king. And we have been living in that world ever since,

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.640
both historically in some sense, and also within the mythological sense. And so one of the reasons

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.680
why our current governance system is so jacked is it's in fact designed to constantly be fighting war.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:39.040
And therefore the elevation of the executive. The other side of it is when you are entered into

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:47.040
a place that has a muscular legislature, and no longer is grounded in a commons, then there aren't

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:52.640
any any truly integrated holes that have both horizontality and vertical, right? When I have

01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.800
a judge in the American political system, evaluate the laws that are written by a legislature,

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:07.120
I have no particular sense that any of those guys are either a non corrupt or b wise or c

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:14.320
have my interest in mind at all, and is imposed upon me, as if it's at war. And so therefore,

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:21.360
I then again have to be and have a relationship of king. The only way to enforce the laws in a

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.720
society where everyone is fundamentally separated from proper real relationality,

01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:36.720
is the implementation of the king style, the executive at the top. And when we have moved

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:42.640
into this new form of governance, this neo neo cortex, remember I mentioned planetary scale

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:48.480
is one of the problematics that we're dealing with. All humans will be in fact in a relationship of

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:54.480
context, relationship of a fully integrated proper whole with verticality and horizontality,

01:23:54.560 --> 01:24:00.880
which means that we are no longer in a position of intrinsically at war, but rather in a space

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:08.080
where the juridical can and therefore, and should play the proper role as the base of

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:15.600
governance, which is very nice. It also applies to the default state of everybody being in a

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.800
relationship of sort of default war, meaning social relationships, relationships that are

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:28.880
not real, not rich, will also no longer be the case. And so conflict can in fact be mitigated by

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:37.280
a properly constructed juridical constellation. So I'll put that as a provisional answer to the

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.400
first question and propose that it also creates a tremendous amount of hooks into the nature of

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:46.160
how we might respond to the second question. Well, I'm going to give you an initial thing

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:52.400
about the second question then, since you did an initial for the first, which is Moses isn't

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:58.160
just a judge, he's also a prophet and all of the judges were also prophets. In fact, the terms are

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:04.800
used and then after the institution of the king, the prophet becomes distinct. And then of course,

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.760
the idea is Christ brings back the pre re integrates the priest, the king and the prophet.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:15.520
But here's the thing about the emergence issue, right? I think we shouldn't judge people,

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:22.000
sorry, we shouldn't people should not ascend to the role or if that's even the right verb,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.720
but whatever, ascend to the role of judge just because of their retrospective capacity to deal

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:36.080
with appropriating and applying the tradition, they should also have a prophetic capacity

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:43.120
to disclose what is pertinent and perennial in a way that shakes people up to what is emerging.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:53.360
Oh, man, that is so sweet. Yes. That is beautiful. Good Lord. I feel like a limited manuscript in

01:25:53.360 --> 01:26:04.240
words. So thank you. Yeah. So let's play with those two ideas when we come back and pick this up.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:13.440
And as always, I'm going to give my guest, which is you, the opportunity for last word.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:17.440
Doesn't that be summative or cumulative? It could just be inspirational, aspirational or

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.840
provocative. It could be enigmatic, but how what parting word do you want to leave?

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:31.040
Let's call it an invocation. We entered into this stage of our relationship, our dialogue,

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:35.360
with a sense of timeliness, meaning that it appears that we are now at a time where it's

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:41.440
proper, necessary and possible for this new form of governance to finally begin the process of

01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:47.360
happening. And so the invocation is that perhaps this conversation will begin that in earnest,

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.200
and that perhaps we're kicking off something deeply new in the human story.

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:58.400
I hope so too. Thank you so much, my dear friend. Wow.
