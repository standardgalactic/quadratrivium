WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
Welcome, everyone. I've been really looking forward to this particular voices with Reveke.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.760
You're no doubt looking at somebody who you've heard, many of you have heard me mention multiple

00:09.760 --> 00:18.560
times. Cytus' work and his influence are repeatedly a huge impact on me and somebody I've gotten to

00:18.560 --> 00:23.680
know on a somewhat more personal level. We were colleagues. I taught his son at one point,

00:24.320 --> 00:32.000
well, multiple points, I think. He's just a fantastic and, I think, important thinker in

00:32.000 --> 00:37.360
the field of cognitive science. I think he's probably one of the most premier, if not the

00:37.360 --> 00:45.360
premier person, representing what's called for ecogsci. That, I think, is very pertinent

00:46.160 --> 00:53.600
to questions that we're wrestling with around the nature of meaning, etc. I'm going to just

00:53.600 --> 00:59.520
turn things over to my friend Evan Thompson and ask him to give us a little bit more of the

00:59.520 --> 01:04.000
background that he thinks might be relevant. Then we'll move to the issue at hand.

01:04.560 --> 01:12.400
Yeah. I am first and foremost a philosopher. That's my academic training. I work in the

01:12.400 --> 01:17.920
areas of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, both theoretical cognitive science and collaborating

01:17.920 --> 01:24.160
with experimental scientists. I also have a strong interest in Asian philosophy. My undergraduate

01:24.160 --> 01:30.000
training was in Asian studies, Chinese language and history. I got drawn into philosophy really

01:30.000 --> 01:34.800
through studying Chinese philosophy. I went the reverse path from the path that sometimes

01:35.600 --> 01:44.240
people take from east to west in my case academically. I have a continuing interest in

01:44.320 --> 01:48.480
the conversation between Asian philosophical traditions and Western philosophy.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.960
I also have a strong interest in phenomenology, the tradition coming from Edmund Husserl.

01:53.680 --> 01:57.680
That plays a strong role. The phenomenological tradition plays a strong role in the most recent

01:57.680 --> 02:05.280
book, The Blind Spot. Which is what we're going to turn to. Evan just referred to it. This is it.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.480
I want to strongly recommend this book, especially for people who are interested in

02:10.480 --> 02:16.320
the meaning crisis. It is the central topic of this book. It is called The Crisis in Meaning,

02:16.320 --> 02:22.480
the Meaning Crisis, The Blind Spot. The Blind Spot is a particular account and explanation of

02:23.360 --> 02:30.320
the meaning crisis. This book is written with Adam Frank, Marcello Glycer, or Gleaser, is it

02:30.320 --> 02:37.440
Glycer? Glycer, Marcello Glycer, yeah. And Evan Thompson is the third author. When I got this

02:37.440 --> 02:43.280
book, I opened it and I was like, whoa, things that are near and dear to my heart and to my work

02:43.280 --> 02:50.000
and my besetting obsessions, the meaning crisis was there. And then there's this notion of the

02:50.000 --> 02:54.560
blind spot, which we'll unpack in a minute. And I turned to chapter nine on cognition as I often do

02:54.560 --> 03:01.280
in any book, because that's my shtick. And the blind spot in cognition was explicitly named as

03:01.280 --> 03:06.320
relevance realization, something else near and dear to my heart. And so as soon as I saw that,

03:06.320 --> 03:11.280
I hadn't read any more of the book, I just read about 10 pages here and looked at the chapter

03:11.280 --> 03:16.000
and I went, oh, wow. And I showed my partner the book and I was like so excited about it. So I

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
reached out to Evan right away and I said, you got to come on, we got to talk about this. Your

03:20.000 --> 03:27.280
work and my work really talk to each other really deeply at this point. The book, just some basic

03:27.280 --> 03:34.320
things, the book is wonderful. I'm talking now sort of rhetorically, it's clearly written,

03:34.320 --> 03:38.720
it's accessible. I wouldn't say it's like a beach read, like you're just going to sit there and

03:38.720 --> 03:43.440
write. You have to put thought into it. It demands, it provokes and demands reflection

03:43.440 --> 03:51.120
and consideration. But it is also not pitched to the academic hoi paloi or anything like that.

03:51.120 --> 03:58.560
It is really written as I think it should be given the topic to a general educated audience

03:58.560 --> 04:03.680
of people who are concerned with the meaning crisis and how we get here and what it is and

04:03.680 --> 04:07.200
what is this meaning we're talking about and how can we ameliorate it. So first of all,

04:08.000 --> 04:14.560
book is really wonderfully written, very clear. Now the thing I want to ask you very quickly

04:14.560 --> 04:21.040
about and unpack this a little bit before we get into the meat of it, this book has a very

04:21.040 --> 04:25.360
single voice to it. Sometimes you know when you're reading books by multiple authors, you hear this,

04:25.360 --> 04:32.080
you get the sense of a carcophony and it's, you know, and you use we throughout and everything,

04:32.080 --> 04:39.600
you're reminding the reader constantly as you should. But the voice has, I find the clear

04:39.600 --> 04:44.640
integrated voice, like how did that come about and how did you make that happen?

04:45.360 --> 04:51.120
Well, I'm glad that it reads that way. Obviously that was, you know, that was a challenge in

04:51.120 --> 05:00.240
writing a book with three authors. And I would say that the responsibility for really doing the

05:01.040 --> 05:06.160
overall smoothing as we called it and kind of unifying of tone and narrative that that was

05:06.160 --> 05:12.560
really part of my role as the writer. Each chapter was written in a first draft initially

05:12.560 --> 05:18.560
by one of the three of us. So Adam Frank, you know, took the lead on the Quantum Mechanics chapter,

05:18.560 --> 05:23.360
Marcelo Gleister took the lead on the Cosmology chapter, I took the lead on, you know, the

05:23.360 --> 05:30.400
Cognition Consciousness and the Introduction chapters. But then we each, you know, wrote over

05:30.400 --> 05:36.320
each other's drafts. And then when we felt that we all were sort of on the same page with regard

05:36.320 --> 05:42.640
to what we were saying, then it was really my job to smooth it out and just give it a unified voice

05:42.640 --> 05:50.320
and tone. Which I'm happy to hear you say you think it works because, you know, when you're

05:50.320 --> 05:58.800
doing something like that, you don't want to remove the particular, you know, the special

05:58.800 --> 06:02.480
things that each author has in the way they articulate something, the way they write something,

06:02.480 --> 06:06.960
you don't want to just remove that and flatten things. But on the other hand, you can't have really

06:08.720 --> 06:15.120
very different styles in the same chapter, let alone the same book. So that definitely took

06:15.120 --> 06:20.000
some work. But I enjoyed that work actually, I found it very satisfying and it enabled me to

06:20.160 --> 06:25.840
really deeply think through each chapter with materials that, you know, I'm not an expert on,

06:25.840 --> 06:31.840
you know, quantum mechanics, cosmology, the physics of time. I mean, these are not my areas

06:31.840 --> 06:35.680
of expertise. I have an interest in them from a philosophy of science angle, but that's not,

06:35.680 --> 06:39.600
you know, to be a scientist in those areas. So I learned a lot from doing that.

06:40.400 --> 06:45.120
Well, that's interesting. And I won't open this up as rabbit hole, although maybe we'll return

06:45.120 --> 06:50.160
to it. I mean, I've been doing a lot of work right now on dialogical reason as opposed to

06:50.160 --> 06:56.240
monological reason and a lot of the emerging evidence about how it has a lot of capacities

06:56.240 --> 07:01.520
to overcome bias and to be more clear and complex at the same time that you get with

07:01.520 --> 07:09.600
monological. So I welcome that, the fact that this was sort of dialogically produced.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.800
So in order to flesh that out a little bit more, can you tell me a little bit more about Adam and

07:14.800 --> 07:22.960
Marcello? Yeah, so Adam Frank is an astronomer and astrophysicist at the University of Rochester.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.920
He works on a number of different things in science and he's written a number of more general

07:29.920 --> 07:38.240
audience books. Marcelo Gleiser is a theoretical physicist and he's also, you know, done a number

07:38.240 --> 07:44.000
of different things in the scientific domains as well as having written a number of popular books.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.320
So the way that we wound up writing this book is that Marcello

07:52.000 --> 07:58.880
directed for I think about five or six years at Dartmouth College where he's based an institute

07:58.880 --> 08:05.840
for cross disciplinary engagement, ICE. And he invited, you know, fellows each year to come and

08:05.840 --> 08:09.680
be there for a couple of weeks and give some talks and just interact with the community there.

08:10.240 --> 08:18.000
And he invited Adam and me, I think it would have been 2016 or 2017, I don't remember,

08:18.000 --> 08:26.880
so we were both there together. And we just started talking and at one point in our conversations

08:26.880 --> 08:32.320
about, you know, science and experience, this term, the blind spot sort of popped into our

08:32.320 --> 08:39.840
conversation and then we just kept sort of working on it, the three of us, and eventually

08:39.840 --> 08:44.000
it became clear that, you know, we had something that we wanted to write. So it really came out

08:44.000 --> 08:49.840
of conversations, our collaboration as a result of Marcello's having this kind of special

08:49.840 --> 08:53.440
intellectual setting where he was inviting scientists and philosophers and historians and

08:54.160 --> 09:02.960
religious teachers, spiritual teachers as well, also to the center. And so their background is

09:02.960 --> 09:07.840
really coming out of physics and history of science and then the conversation between us

09:07.840 --> 09:15.680
was what launched the book. That's excellent. So there's a good representation both from the

09:15.760 --> 09:24.000
history and the philosophy of science going into this book. So I want you to unpack the

09:24.000 --> 09:28.400
core argument. No, and people do this to me all the time. Can you summarize Awakening Tim from

09:28.400 --> 09:40.320
the meeting crisis? Right. Yeah. So we'll give you time and space, but when you do that, though,

09:40.320 --> 09:46.640
can you talk a little bit about how at least these figures show up in the introduction? They

09:46.640 --> 09:53.920
show up sort of throughout, but you know, Nishita and Whitehead and then Cartwright,

09:54.880 --> 10:00.160
three philosophers at least, that's maybe the best category they all belong to,

10:00.160 --> 10:05.360
are playing a pivotal role. Cartwright I'm unfamiliar with. I've just purchased a couple

10:05.440 --> 10:10.720
of her books because of the blind spot, so thank you for that. Now, Whitehead and Nishita,

10:10.720 --> 10:16.080
I'm doing a lot of work on and I've been doing this on and off for several years, but

10:17.760 --> 10:28.240
I mean, they have a notion about this idea that in some way, I'll use Whitehead's idea here.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.640
We've gotten into kind of a performative contradictions where we're making statements

10:32.640 --> 10:40.240
about reality, and then I'll use Nishita from a standpoint that isn't consistent with those

10:40.240 --> 10:47.840
statements. So, and many people on watching my channel, I've made this argument about scientists

10:48.800 --> 10:53.280
making pronouncements about everything above the level of the quantum being an illusion,

10:53.280 --> 10:58.560
and then it's like, but then you're basing those statements on all these illusory machines and

10:58.560 --> 11:04.720
gauges and illusory conferences and like, what? How are you drawing deep conclusions about the

11:04.720 --> 11:09.840
ultimate nature of reality from all this illusory material and that there's a performative contradiction?

11:13.760 --> 11:17.600
I don't know if this is the actual source, but I credit Whitehead was sort of the first person

11:17.600 --> 11:22.240
to really put his finger on that performative contradiction, although I've seen Nishita doing

11:22.240 --> 11:28.640
something very similar, especially when he gets to Basho, when he's talking about Basho. So,

11:30.480 --> 11:37.200
what is the argument and why the term the blind spot, which I found really helpful

11:38.080 --> 11:48.240
as an enacted metaphor for this? Right. So, maybe we'll start with the metaphor of the blind spot.

11:48.240 --> 11:55.040
So, the blind spot in the way that we're using the term is a metaphor from the blind spot in

11:55.040 --> 12:06.160
the individual field that we have that all mammals have, actually. And it's the area of the retina

12:06.160 --> 12:16.640
where the optic nerve leaves and projects inward into the brain. And because there are no

12:17.280 --> 12:21.840
light sensitive receptor cells, where that bundle of nerve fibers enters into the brain,

12:21.840 --> 12:27.760
we don't see anything in the blind spot. There's no possibility of visual sensitivity

12:27.760 --> 12:32.240
to what's in the blind spot. But we also don't see that we have a blind spot because

12:35.120 --> 12:38.960
the situation is the eyes are constantly darting about and the blind spots of the two eyes are

12:38.960 --> 12:44.000
different. And so, as it is said, we sort of fill in across the blind spot. So,

12:44.000 --> 12:50.160
we have a blind spot, an area within the visual field in which we don't see and we don't see

12:50.160 --> 12:58.800
that we don't see. So, this is a metaphor for the idea that in our scientific world view,

12:59.600 --> 13:07.440
there is something that makes science possible, that is the, you could say, the source of science.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.920
But we don't see it and we don't see that we don't see it. And what it is, and now we could

13:13.920 --> 13:19.840
use different words for this. What it is, is lived experience, direct experience, immediate

13:19.840 --> 13:29.120
intuition, pure awareness, these terms that thinkers like William James and Kitara Nishida,

13:29.920 --> 13:36.000
and also figures in literature in the 19th turn of the 20th century are interested in

13:36.000 --> 13:41.680
stream of consciousness. All of these thinkers as modern science is becoming this tremendously

13:41.680 --> 13:47.520
powerful epistemic accomplishment. All of these thinkers are Whitehead, Husserl, the phenomenologists,

13:47.520 --> 13:54.960
they're all grappling with this recognition that there is an experiential source to our knowledge

13:55.600 --> 14:02.960
that we systematically occlude when we think about the nature of that knowledge. And the way that we

14:02.960 --> 14:09.280
do that, it takes different forms, but the way that we do that in how we think about science

14:09.280 --> 14:18.400
is that we step back, we look for invariance across perspectives, we look for things that we can

14:20.080 --> 14:28.160
objectify and quantify across a community of observers, forgetting that those things actually

14:28.160 --> 14:33.360
depend on and arise out of a background of lived experience. And then we objectify them in a way

14:33.360 --> 14:38.160
where we take them to be more fundamental than the experience that underpins them.

14:38.800 --> 14:44.800
And that's the sort of crucial move in what we call the blind spot, is this treatment of what

14:46.720 --> 14:50.800
comes about through a certain method, let's call it a method of objectification, which is a very

14:50.800 --> 14:56.400
powerful and very useful method. We're not arguing against the method as such, but when you forget

14:56.480 --> 15:03.840
that it's a method and you take it for the being of what you're studying in a way that makes that

15:03.840 --> 15:11.840
being more fundamental than the experience that's animating the method, then what you've done is,

15:11.840 --> 15:17.600
and here we really rely on Husserl in the crisis of European science, you substitute a method for

15:17.600 --> 15:23.360
being, which is like a category error, and Husserl calls this the surreptitious substitution.

15:24.320 --> 15:29.440
You substitute a method that you've arrived at, Husserl identifies it as arising really most

15:29.440 --> 15:36.880
powerfully in Galileo, where Galileo imagines the world with no sentient creatures. He then

15:38.000 --> 15:45.120
treats nature in terms of mathematical properties, where the mathematical properties,

15:46.000 --> 15:50.160
the method for him is geometry, the mathematical properties are then taken to be the actual

15:50.160 --> 15:57.920
being and reality of the universe from a god's eye point of view that sees the language in which

15:57.920 --> 16:05.120
nature is written. That move of substituting a method for being, that's the surreptitious

16:05.120 --> 16:11.280
substitution that's built into the blind spot. The connection to whitehead is that whitehead,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.880
there's two concepts in whitehead that are important for us. For whiteheadians out there,

16:16.880 --> 16:23.680
I would say that we're really working here from what is sometimes called whitehead's middle period,

16:23.680 --> 16:28.880
so the concept of nature is a really important book for us, and also science in the modern world,

16:28.880 --> 16:34.080
which is a little bit later. Whitehead says there's, in the epistemology that gets attached

16:34.720 --> 16:39.760
to modern science, or to natural philosophy, you could say there's a bifurcation of nature,

16:40.960 --> 16:45.680
where we say, as Galileo did, what's objective and fundamentally real are the

16:45.680 --> 16:50.560
mathematical properties, and the qualities, the lived experience, that's subjective.

16:51.840 --> 16:56.320
In a way, it gets kicked outside of nature. That's the bifurcation. It gets kicked outside,

16:56.320 --> 17:02.160
because if nature is that which is mathematical, and those qualities have to be removed in order

17:02.160 --> 17:06.160
to mathematicalize nature, then what are you going to do with those qualities that are residing,

17:06.160 --> 17:13.360
as it were in the mind? Well, the mind then gets excised from nature. Whitehead is insistent on

17:13.360 --> 17:19.520
saying, even from the standpoint of natural philosophy, you cannot do that, because the

17:19.520 --> 17:26.080
lived, sensuous qualities belong to nature. The task is to create a system of relations

17:28.480 --> 17:35.520
that treats them on the same level playing field and integrates them. To think that

17:36.320 --> 17:42.080
the abstractions, the mathematical abstractions, are what nature really is. Whitehead calls that

17:42.080 --> 17:47.920
the fallacy of misplaced concreteness, because you've got an abstraction that you concretize,

17:47.920 --> 17:54.080
and no, what's concrete is, in Whitehead's terms, it's the sensuous experience or the sense

17:54.080 --> 18:00.320
awareness in which nature is given to us in terms of passage and duration and flow out of which we

18:00.320 --> 18:07.200
abstract things like space, time, continuum, and so on. That's what we set up in the beginning

18:07.200 --> 18:12.000
of the book, where the blind spot, just to maybe succinctly summarize it, the blind spot is

18:12.000 --> 18:18.160
the inability to see or to recognize or to acknowledge that lived experience is the source of

18:18.160 --> 18:28.000
science. If you undercut the source of science by occluding lived experience, this is central to

18:28.000 --> 18:35.280
our argument, you're actually damaging science, because you're removing the epistemic footing

18:35.280 --> 18:44.000
that it needs to be the powerful investigative method it is. What happens is you get this

18:44.880 --> 18:49.920
symptomatic of the meaning crisis in our culture, you get this oscillation between the extreme of

18:49.920 --> 18:54.560
science triumphalism, which is science is the greatest method ever, and the world is what

18:54.560 --> 18:59.680
science tells us it is, on the one hand, and then you get science denial, on the other hand,

18:59.680 --> 19:03.920
because a very natural reaction to science triumphalism is to say, well, that's not how I

19:03.920 --> 19:10.000
experience the world, regardless of what you say, and in a world of rapid transmission of

19:10.000 --> 19:16.160
information and misinformation and willful misleading of people, that oscillation between

19:16.160 --> 19:21.200
science triumphalism and science denial becomes particularly problematic and pernicious.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.160
That's sort of the setup of the book at the very beginning.

19:24.960 --> 19:33.040
That was great. That oscillation is, I mean, it also comes to the fore in some ways in

19:34.880 --> 19:38.720
it. I don't know if it's the same, but it resonates with the oscillation. We have an

19:38.720 --> 19:43.360
instability in our sense of realness. We have these two, right? We have the mathematical sense

19:43.360 --> 19:49.280
of realness and Descartes played with both to no resolution, or we have this, you know, the core

19:49.280 --> 19:54.960
of where consciousness is present to itself as what is most real, and we also vacillate between

19:54.960 --> 20:00.320
those. I don't know if they are identical, but at least they seem to be tracking also between

20:00.320 --> 20:05.760
science triumphalism and science denialism. I thought that was beautiful. It sounds like you're,

20:05.760 --> 20:11.760
and this is a bit of Nishita in it, you're picking up on that the blind spot, we're not only

20:14.080 --> 20:20.800
unaware of it, but it is also simultaneously the source of our ability to see.

20:22.080 --> 20:29.040
You're right, right? Because the optic, right? And Nishitani builds on this. It's the not the

20:29.040 --> 20:38.640
thing that makes it accessible to us and that sort of thing. So that move is really interesting to

20:38.640 --> 20:45.360
me. This idea of grounding, and you use that term a couple of times in source, you use that term a lot.

20:47.040 --> 20:52.800
So what would you say to somebody who says, well, what do you mean? I mean,

20:53.360 --> 20:58.480
isn't there a difference between the epistemological order of how I come to

20:59.120 --> 21:04.560
knowledge and the ontological order of what that knowledge discloses? Yeah, I have to start in sense

21:04.560 --> 21:13.920
experience and etc, etc. But that doesn't mean that that ordering of my epistemological endeavor is

21:13.920 --> 21:20.000
the same as the order of reality or how it unfolds. I know that you're ready for this, but I want to

21:20.000 --> 21:23.760
hear what you have to say about it. Sure, sure. Well, this depends on what ordering means. So

21:26.640 --> 21:33.120
I mean, at one level, it certainly is something that needs to be recognized that the

21:34.560 --> 21:41.760
procedure by which we disclose something is one thing, and that which is disclosed is another thing.

21:42.320 --> 21:47.840
The ordering, though, if it's a hierarchical ordering in terms of

21:47.840 --> 21:56.320
fundamentals goes beyond just that recognition, because it says what's ontologically fundamental

21:57.600 --> 22:04.960
is, let's say, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the properties as

22:04.960 --> 22:14.080
mathematical. And the experience is derivative. The problem with that ordering is that

22:16.080 --> 22:20.640
the mathematical properties exist at a different level of intelligibility

22:22.160 --> 22:28.160
from the concrete phenomena. And they are, if you will, the map and the territory is the

22:28.240 --> 22:36.720
concrete phenomena. And if you, if you assume that the territory just is the particular map

22:36.720 --> 22:43.520
in the way that you're able to render it using, you know, the tools of, of objectification and

22:43.520 --> 22:52.240
mathematics, that's, that's actually to not see that. So let me give a concrete illustration,

22:52.240 --> 22:55.840
because this is a very abstract way of putting it. So, so one of the things we talk about is time.

22:56.640 --> 23:04.320
And so we have the idea that, you know, from a, from the standpoint of physics clock, you know,

23:04.320 --> 23:13.200
time is what clocks measure. That's fine as a method. But if you then say, well, what time is

23:13.200 --> 23:19.440
is what a clock measures, you've forgotten that there needs to be clock readers, and they exist

23:19.520 --> 23:27.760
in some window of duration, that's, that's a continuous flow that disappears if you, if you

23:28.320 --> 23:34.800
try to reconstruct it in terms of, you know, point-like instance and clock readings. So

23:34.800 --> 23:41.040
So I want to make sure I'm tracking. You're saying something like there's a kind of time

23:41.040 --> 23:45.440
in clock reading that is presupposed in measuring time with a clock.

23:45.520 --> 23:51.760
Exactly. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah. So, so there was just a review of the blind spot in

23:52.320 --> 23:58.560
LA review of books by Robert Crease, who's a philosopher of physics, also writes, you know,

23:58.560 --> 24:04.320
general books about, about science. And he had a wonderful statement that I, that I wish we had

24:04.320 --> 24:09.680
actually thought of. And let me see if I can, if I can, if I can get it exactly. So he, he says,

24:09.680 --> 24:17.760
describing our view, no one pulls out a clock to know what time is, they pull out a clock to

24:17.760 --> 24:23.680
know what time it is. So that's basically the idea, right? You already have to have some

24:25.360 --> 24:31.520
experience of time. And you might say sort of to use a, use a phenomenological term, a kind of,

24:31.520 --> 24:38.240
you know, pre-understanding of time in order to be able to recognize a clock as at all relevant

24:38.240 --> 24:45.600
to, you know, to the, to the subject phenomenon that you're immersed in. So the ordering, so the

24:45.600 --> 24:50.400
just to go back to the ordering point. So the ordering is, is, is what we object to is the

24:50.400 --> 24:55.200
sort of hierarchical ordering in terms of fundamentality, where we say experience is not

24:55.200 --> 25:02.560
fundamental, or what's disclosed to us of the world in how we experience it is derivative,

25:02.560 --> 25:09.040
not fundamental. And what's fundamental is what we, what we're able to reveal through,

25:09.920 --> 25:11.840
through say, mathematical models.

25:33.920 --> 25:38.800
Okay, so there's two moves here, and I like both of them, because I've advocated for both of them.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.280
So I hope, I hope this isn't just two members of the choir performing in front of the minister

25:43.280 --> 25:48.640
or something like that. That's okay too. Because I've talked about, you know, even a naturalist

25:48.640 --> 25:53.120
should be committed not only to what is derivable from your science, but what is presupposed by

25:53.120 --> 25:57.520
the practice of your science. And that's exactly what you seem to be saying. You're right. Greg

25:57.520 --> 26:04.400
Enriquez and I talk about that as extended naturalism. Right. And then the next one is,

26:04.400 --> 26:09.200
and then this one may be, may be more controversial, but it sort of follows from the

26:10.880 --> 26:17.760
first, there's an implicit judgment of realness. And I think, well, I hope you agree,

26:17.760 --> 26:24.320
I take real as a comparative adjective, right. You know, Marla, people from Plato to Marla

26:24.320 --> 26:28.960
Pondida Whitehead have said, you only judge one thing as an illusion by judging something

26:28.960 --> 26:34.000
else as real. It's always comparative and vice versa. And so what I was hearing something like

26:34.000 --> 26:40.560
fundamental, implying something like more real, and the idea is, I'm not happy with this term,

26:40.560 --> 26:45.440
and we'll play with them a little bit later, but the concrete is more real than the abstract.

26:45.440 --> 26:50.240
Because of something like, and you say this multiple times too, there's a richness, there's an

26:50.320 --> 26:56.960
inexhaustible-ness to that. And this is the point about the map territory kind of,

26:56.960 --> 27:04.080
the territory is way richer, has an inexhaustible, it overflows any particular map, even a globe,

27:04.080 --> 27:11.920
even a Earth-Science globe, et cetera, et cetera. Is that, that's very, so for me,

27:11.920 --> 27:15.840
just as we're sort of putting cards on the table, that's the influence of Polania on me. He was

27:15.840 --> 27:21.120
proposing that as the mark of what he calls contact with reality. And Esther, like Kat Mead,

27:21.120 --> 27:26.000
has talked about that in her book of the same title. This inexhaustible-ness, but it's not

27:26.000 --> 27:30.960
carcophonist inexhaustible, and we'll play with that a little bit. It's kind of like an inexhaustible

27:30.960 --> 27:37.680
fountain of intelligibility, right? And so is that, is that, is that what I think of it?

27:37.680 --> 27:45.200
Yeah, so that's very much it. I mean, another way that I think of it is that our being always

27:45.200 --> 27:52.640
is more than or overflows our knowing, because knowing happens through certain means,

27:52.640 --> 27:57.440
through certain methods, through certain sensory systems, through certain forms of

27:57.440 --> 28:02.960
intelligibility, and our being is always larger than that. It always overflows that, yeah.

28:03.680 --> 28:08.240
So that would, that's wonderful, Evan. I've got to slow down. I'm very enthusiastic.

28:08.800 --> 28:15.600
So that, that means that, well, let me form it as a question. Is it possible that one,

28:15.600 --> 28:20.400
because I've made an argument that one of the contributors to the meaning crisis is we've reduced

28:21.280 --> 28:26.480
many kinds of knowing that have many different kinds of memory attached to them, procedural,

28:26.480 --> 28:31.360
episodic, autonometric, have different criteria of realness to them, skill is power,

28:32.320 --> 28:36.560
you know, perspectival knowing is sort of like noticing, getting that sense of,

28:36.560 --> 28:40.880
you know, getting deeper into things, more present to them. And then the participatory

28:40.880 --> 28:47.360
knowing is the sense of sort of belonging, fittedness to your environment. And what I mean by that

28:47.360 --> 28:54.560
is part of, I hear you saying this, but I want to frame it, like our practice, we've reduced what

28:55.280 --> 29:01.440
knowing is, and we forgot, when we do that, we've forgot the ultimate responsibility of

29:01.440 --> 29:06.240
knowing to being, like particularly our being, but also being in general, like we forgot that

29:06.240 --> 29:12.800
there are ways of knowing that are more, or are closer metaphor to our being in the world than

29:12.800 --> 29:18.720
these mathematical abstractions. Is that also tracking? Oh, definitely. Yeah, no, definitely. I think

29:22.720 --> 29:26.560
there are different kinds of knowing, there are different modes of knowing, I suppose you might

29:26.560 --> 29:37.120
say, different ways of delineating those, of course, too. And it's, because science is so

29:37.120 --> 29:47.760
transformatively powerful, in its outward, you know, obvious manifestations, we have defaulted

29:47.760 --> 29:52.720
to thinking, and I mean, you see this explicitly in Descartes, right? We have defaulted to thinking

29:52.720 --> 29:59.520
that knowing is a matter of having a method. And that's true for some methods of knowing.

30:01.360 --> 30:07.520
But even the application of a method presupposes something that you can't, you know,

30:08.640 --> 30:12.800
state in terms of a method, right? I mean, this is a familiar kind of thing for philosophers.

30:13.520 --> 30:22.000
Yeah. So, yeah, no, that's right. There's a kind of acquaintance, you could say,

30:22.800 --> 30:27.520
that we have with our being, that is not a matter of having a method. That acquaintance is not

30:27.520 --> 30:31.440
unproblematic, of course. I mean, all sorts of questions arise in relation to that, you know,

30:31.440 --> 30:35.200
normative questions, existential questions, philosophical questions, ethical, political, of

30:35.200 --> 30:42.400
course. But it's the background for the application of any method, exactly.

30:43.040 --> 30:47.360
Well, I was smiling because, and I know you're aware of this, because you treated about it,

30:47.360 --> 30:54.000
you know, with Johannes Yeager and Anna Riedel and Aldrich Bedwick and Dennis Walsh.

30:55.040 --> 31:00.720
We're trying to get a paper published on how you can't ultimately, you can't capture relevance

31:00.720 --> 31:05.920
realization in computation for exactly that reason, that the process of formalization of

31:05.920 --> 31:10.400
translating things into a formal system is always an ill-defined problem that requires

31:10.400 --> 31:15.360
relevance realization. And that sort of, I mean, there's a lot more to that paper, but that's the

31:15.360 --> 31:22.560
core kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, no, I love that paper and I completely agree and sympathize with

31:22.560 --> 31:29.920
the argument. Yeah. Now, what's interesting, excellent answer to that question. So, I'm going

31:29.920 --> 31:34.160
to throw out these, like, devil's advocate things and then you do this wonderful thing and we get

31:34.160 --> 31:39.760
into some nice discussion. Well, somebody will say, bifurcation, come on, we've always bifurcated,

31:39.760 --> 31:45.760
because we have to and we do, even in our lived experience, readily and reliably make

31:45.760 --> 31:51.360
distinguishing distinctions between appearance and reality, fraud and reality, illusion and

31:51.360 --> 31:57.600
reality, delusion and reality, hallucination and reality, right? And yeah, maybe we cut it up as

31:57.600 --> 32:03.040
a subjective and objective, but the ancient world cut it up into the problem of the one in the mini.

32:03.120 --> 32:11.040
We're always building these worldviews, trying to somehow give us a normative guide for how we

32:11.040 --> 32:18.960
discern, you know, reality from appearance. And so, isn't a bifurcation an inevitable thing,

32:18.960 --> 32:31.680
therefore? Yeah, so, of course, we always live in a world where we have to make distinctions

32:31.680 --> 32:37.680
between, you know, the appearance of something and, as we say, how it really is. But if we think

32:37.680 --> 32:44.800
about how that works, the test, the criterion, the standard for how something really is, is

32:44.800 --> 32:51.280
disclosed in and through another experience. So, it's not that we step outside of experience and

32:51.280 --> 32:58.400
we have some absolute standard or metric by which we can say, this is real and that isn't real. It's

32:58.400 --> 33:04.960
rather that we continually open up new vistas, new horizons in experience where the relationship

33:04.960 --> 33:11.760
between appearance and reality shifts within the sphere of experience itself. So, that's not really

33:12.800 --> 33:22.000
bifurcation in Whitehead sense. That's a sort of progressive changing of appearances, perspectives,

33:22.000 --> 33:30.080
you know, profiles, aspects of things where what we take to be true or real is something

33:30.800 --> 33:35.680
disclosed, again, through experience where Whitehead, when he uses the term bifurcation

33:35.680 --> 33:44.320
of nature, really means you kick experience out of the framework of scientific, the framework

33:44.320 --> 33:48.720
of the scientific representation of nature. And then, and we know this very well today in terms

33:48.720 --> 33:53.600
of the hard problem of consciousness, then you face a very, very fundamentally difficult problem

33:53.600 --> 34:03.920
of how to recover consciousness, awareness, the mind. And the hard problem is that problem.

34:03.920 --> 34:10.000
It's a problem that that derives in a way from the bifurcation of nature in the way that we state

34:10.000 --> 34:14.880
the problem today, which is, you know, how is consciousness possible in a purely physical

34:14.880 --> 34:20.720
world where we conceive the purely physical in terms of this bifurcation of, you know, a

34:20.720 --> 34:29.360
mathematical, quantitative nature, that then somehow we have to find a room for the qualia,

34:29.360 --> 34:34.880
the qualitative properties, the phenomenality, the appearances. And then we either, we do that by

34:34.880 --> 34:38.880
either trying to, you know, be reductionist and say, well, it just really is physicality

34:39.440 --> 34:43.600
in the face of the obvious sort of problem of conceptual intelligibility there.

34:43.600 --> 34:48.880
Or we say, well, it actually is an illusion itself. We sort of go the illusionist route.

34:48.880 --> 34:54.160
And then we strain at the intelligibility of the concept of an illusion. Or we, you know,

34:54.160 --> 34:59.440
or we go panpsychist and we say, well, there's a sense in which consciousness and some minimal,

34:59.440 --> 35:04.560
phenomenal sense is sort of an ingredient everywhere at all levels. So we sort of like

35:05.280 --> 35:09.520
having sucked the consciousness out, we then sort of like spray it back into the universe

35:09.520 --> 35:15.360
as it were everywhere. And that doesn't really work either. So that's the bifurcation. So,

35:15.360 --> 35:20.560
so yes, of course, we have to make distinctions between appearance and reality, genuine counterfeit.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.560
But we always do that within a framework of the test of experience.

35:25.200 --> 35:29.440
So that's the key move. And I liked that. That was a great answer. And there was a moment in the

35:29.440 --> 35:34.160
book. Sorry, I don't mean to indicate it was the only moment in the book. There was one moment

35:34.160 --> 35:39.120
in the book, one among many, where I was, I was looking at this and I said, oh, I never put those

35:39.120 --> 35:44.320
two together. I, you know, I talk, obviously, about, you know, the relationship to God and

35:44.320 --> 35:48.800
the two worlds mythology. But you did this, you made this move where you said, you know, the thing

35:48.800 --> 35:55.200
about the idea of this, I don't know what to call it, you know, the monarchical God or something

35:55.200 --> 36:02.800
like that God, even when that God disappeared, we preserved the placeholder function of the

36:02.800 --> 36:11.120
view from nowhere, right? And in there. And so what I hear you critiquing is that view from

36:11.120 --> 36:17.200
nowhere possibility. It's like, yes, yes, there's reality, illusion, reality distinctions, but you

36:17.200 --> 36:24.320
never are in the place from nowhere, no when to make that distinction. Is that, is that a fair way?

36:24.320 --> 36:31.200
That's right. Exactly. I mean, if you read, if you read Newton or Galileo, you have this

36:32.160 --> 36:41.040
this conception, a particular kind of conception of God as, as able to, you know, behold everything

36:41.040 --> 36:47.200
at all times from all possible perspectives. You know, Newton says that, you know, space is God's

36:47.200 --> 36:53.920
sensorium. So there's a sense of God can, can contemplate, you know, every, every possible

36:54.640 --> 37:01.360
perspective of a thing in space. You, you have a, you have a conception of, of the outside view

37:01.360 --> 37:08.640
and science, you know, is, it may never achieve that, but that's it's, it's ideal in a way.

37:08.640 --> 37:12.160
And so that is very much what we're, what we're criticizing is no, that that's,

37:13.840 --> 37:19.600
that's not how science works. And it's not how knowledge works. It's not how experience works.

37:20.240 --> 37:26.480
So, so that's really good. And I want to, I want to, I want to shift back into Nishita just for a

37:26.480 --> 37:33.680
sec. I forget where it's in Nishita, but Carter talks about it in his beautiful book, The Nothingness

37:33.680 --> 37:37.920
Beyond God. He talks about Nishita's distinction between the transcendent, transcendent and the

37:37.920 --> 37:43.120
imminent transcendent. Right. Right. Right. Because you, well, you qualified something,

37:43.120 --> 37:46.480
and I think it was good that you did because some of my people listening to this,

37:47.440 --> 37:51.600
you're, you're not the village atheist or something like that. That's not what's being

37:51.600 --> 37:58.560
argued for here. And so, and I hear you're saying, well, that conception, the transcendent,

37:58.560 --> 38:04.720
transcendent, that, that is probably given this argument, a performative contradiction of some

38:04.720 --> 38:10.320
kind. Like it's, it's ultimately not conceivable to us, not just because we're limited or finite,

38:10.320 --> 38:15.280
but because it is inherently, it severs itself from the very sources of meaning and understanding.

38:15.280 --> 38:20.960
Is that, is that, that is, yeah. Whereas there's something like the notion of the imminent

38:20.960 --> 38:26.160
transcendence, which you get, of course, in, in Whitehead, right? You have the, the emergence,

38:26.160 --> 38:30.080
right? You, you have, and we can talk about whether or not you still like this language,

38:30.080 --> 38:34.000
but you know, you have the eternal and the emergent and they're constantly resonating with

38:34.000 --> 38:40.160
each other, but they're always bound together. Whitehead says, you know, God transcends the

38:40.160 --> 38:44.480
world to the same degree that the world transcends God and God is imminent in the world to the same

38:44.480 --> 38:48.880
degree the world is imminent in God. And I think that's very aligned with what Nashid is trying to

38:48.880 --> 38:56.800
get at. Now, so you aren't responsible to every possible audience. I get that. But a lot of people

38:56.800 --> 39:02.000
come to this and I think this is a fair point around the meaning crisis and they come to this

39:02.000 --> 39:06.800
around the issue of sacredness because they say, yes, you're talking about reality and you're talking

39:06.800 --> 39:13.200
about things can be more real. I can be closer. I can be more in conformity to it. I can live a,

39:13.200 --> 39:18.400
perhaps a fuller life, a more responsible life. And there's a sense that that could even be sacred.

39:18.400 --> 39:23.200
It could afford transforming me, making me a better person. And, you know, both Whitehead has,

39:23.200 --> 39:30.320
has a God and Nashida talks a lot about God and he certainly has a sacred in it. So I know you're

39:30.320 --> 39:34.800
not a theologian and I'm not, I'm not trying to bend you into something, but I think this is a fair

39:34.800 --> 39:39.520
question. Because these questions around the meaning crisis bring up issues around, you know,

39:39.520 --> 39:44.640
about sacredness and ultimacy. And what would you say about that? Would you say that?

39:46.240 --> 39:51.760
Yeah, because there's a parallel. This is all final proposal for before I shut up and let you

39:51.760 --> 39:56.800
answer the question. There's a parallel with religious denial and religious triumphalism,

39:56.800 --> 40:01.680
I think, in a certain way. And, and maybe, you know, and you're, you're trying to get out of the one.

40:02.720 --> 40:08.400
And I, I, I agree with you on that, the science and you're trying, and I've been trying to get

40:08.400 --> 40:13.040
out of the other. And I'm wondering if you see relationship between them, particularly because

40:13.040 --> 40:18.160
we're, and I want to get into this with you at some point. I think this meaning, what psychologists

40:18.160 --> 40:23.040
call meaning in life, not semantic meaning, but this sense of connectedness to reality is what's

40:23.040 --> 40:29.280
behind, you know, our judgments of what is, you know, most real and most sacred, most important

40:29.280 --> 40:34.560
for us, etc. Do you think those two problems talk to each other? I know you don't, I haven't

40:34.880 --> 40:38.560
like a whole book, maybe you talk about it in other places in the book, but do you think about it?

40:38.560 --> 40:43.280
Yeah, no, those are really interesting thoughts and questions. That definitely goes beyond what

40:43.280 --> 40:47.280
we talk about in the book. So we don't, I mean, I'm happy to talk about it here, but just, just

40:48.160 --> 40:52.000
to be clear about the book, it's not, we don't really enter into issues about,

40:54.080 --> 41:01.280
you might say larger issues about meaning that connect to, to religion or to the sacred or to

41:01.280 --> 41:07.280
spirituality. You know, we may be allude to the certain aspects of them here and there,

41:07.280 --> 41:11.520
but they're not, they're not a really dominant theme in the book that, you know, the book is

41:11.520 --> 41:17.600
really circumscribed by the, by the effort to, you know, help us get clear about what science is

41:17.600 --> 41:22.800
and how science works. But that, of course, immediately raises the question from, you know,

41:22.800 --> 41:28.320
a larger perspective of how to think about science in relationship to philosophy or religion or to

41:28.480 --> 41:42.000
issues about, about the sacred. This is difficult, you know, in a way to know exactly how to enter,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.640
because, you know, the word, the word sacred can mean different things. The word, you know,

41:46.640 --> 41:51.600
the word God can mean different things like whitehead has a very idiosyncratic

41:51.760 --> 41:59.200
conception of God. I mean, it's been generative for process theology, but, but it's, it's, it's,

41:59.200 --> 42:02.880
it's an outlying conception, even within the realm of theology.

42:04.640 --> 42:11.280
So I would do how I'm using it and maybe and see if that's good enough. And I'm deeply influenced

42:11.280 --> 42:17.840
here by a fellow Canadian, Schellenberg, and his idea of the triple transcendent. The sacred is

42:17.840 --> 42:24.320
that which is, in some sense, ultimately real for us. It is ultimately transformative for us. It

42:24.320 --> 42:29.600
has a sodorological function. It's not just an intellectual ascent. And then it has an

42:29.600 --> 42:36.480
axiological, it serves as kind of an ultimate normative guide for us in some way and making

42:36.480 --> 42:43.280
our ethical and aesthetic, even epistemological judgments. And, and, and, and other people

42:43.280 --> 42:47.200
like Bracken and the Divine Matrix seem to be arguing that I'm not, I'm not saying this

42:47.200 --> 42:52.480
is going to satisfy everybody, but maybe it's enough of a core so that we got something to work

42:52.480 --> 42:58.480
with in answering the question I'm posing to you. Yeah. I guess the way that I have been

42:58.480 --> 43:04.720
thinking about that recently, so that this isn't really worked out for me in a thorough way, but,

43:04.720 --> 43:08.800
but, but I have thought about these things, you know, more in actually in relation to the

43:08.800 --> 43:13.600
writings that I've done about Buddhism and religion and science in my, in my earlier book,

43:13.600 --> 43:16.480
Why I'm Not a Buddhist. So there's an issue I would say about,

43:17.120 --> 43:20.720
You're going to come on my show and talk to me about that book when I get to that book. I've had

43:20.720 --> 43:24.800
that book on my shelf for a while and I apologize for that. But yeah, no worries. Yeah. Yeah. No,

43:24.800 --> 43:31.200
that would be fun. So we might, we might use Tillick's idea of, you know, faith as ultimate

43:31.200 --> 43:36.160
concern, like not to say that it has to stop there, but we can take that idea as an entry point.

43:36.160 --> 43:42.320
I like Tillick a lot as you know, he's big. Yeah. So ultimate concern,

43:44.400 --> 43:48.240
or, you know, we could, we could use the word sacred to mean ultimate concern as well. So,

43:48.240 --> 43:57.680
so, you know, faith, sacred, ultimate concern. For me, one issue really has to do with a juxtaposition

43:57.760 --> 44:07.600
between what Martin Hoagland calls secular faith. So this is the idea of faith in our, in our being

44:09.040 --> 44:15.760
as faith in our finitude, faith in the life we share together as finite beings, you know,

44:15.760 --> 44:20.880
under the, under the horizon of death or within the, you know, the limit of the horizon of death,

44:21.440 --> 44:25.920
the kind of existential secular conception of ultimate concern, where ultimate concern

44:25.920 --> 44:31.040
really has to be grounded in, in this life and, and this world that we, that we share with each

44:31.040 --> 44:42.240
other. Good, good. Whereas the notion of transcendence can be used in a way that would, that would,

44:42.240 --> 44:46.480
that would be juxtaposed to that where transcendence would mean something like

44:47.200 --> 45:02.320
a state either of liberation or freedom or release that takes us beyond or outside this life.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.480
Transcendence doesn't have to be used that way because you could have a transcendence in

45:06.480 --> 45:13.360
imminence again within this, you know, within this life. But when used that way, which I think is,

45:13.920 --> 45:22.160
is one fundamental sense of transcendence we see running through lots of different religious traditions,

45:23.680 --> 45:26.640
then I don't see,

45:30.560 --> 45:35.520
it's not that I want to deny that because I think for many people that's important and meaningful

45:37.040 --> 45:42.320
but it wouldn't be how I would articulate the sacred or ultimate concern.

45:43.200 --> 45:48.800
Right. And so there's a diss, I mean, and I've realized I've made an error sometimes in making

45:48.800 --> 45:52.560
this a hard and fast distinction, it's more of a continuum, but there is a distinction to be made

45:52.560 --> 45:57.520
between something being indispensable to somebody and somebody claiming it's sort of metaphysically

45:57.520 --> 46:03.840
necessary in some fashion. The example I use is I'm, I'm monolingual, so English is indispensable

46:03.840 --> 46:10.080
to my cognitive agency. That doesn't mean it's metaphysically necessary. And so I think,

46:10.640 --> 46:18.080
I think that's how I sort of parse what you're doing. And I agree with you, the sacred does not

46:18.720 --> 46:24.400
obligate us to any kind of escapism because behind the escapism is a two worlds mythology

46:24.400 --> 46:27.920
and then we have the problem of the bifurcation and then we're getting into back to the very place

46:27.920 --> 46:35.840
we're trying to get from. And I agree with that. That's a mistake. But here's like, so for example,

46:35.840 --> 46:38.640
the meaning in life literature, you want to ask people if they have meaning in life, you can

46:38.640 --> 46:44.320
ask them these three questions. And like, and like, what do you want to exist even if you don't?

46:45.040 --> 46:48.720
Sorry, say that question again. What do you want to exist even if you don't?

46:48.720 --> 46:54.080
Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. How real is it? And sometimes you put in the qualifier,

46:54.080 --> 46:58.640
how really real is it? Because what do you mean, right? And then, and then how much of a difference

46:58.640 --> 47:03.600
do you make to it right now? If you got, if you got something, it doesn't have to be an object,

47:03.600 --> 47:08.880
obviously, if you have something that, you know, this is Susan Wolf's, this is trying to, you know,

47:08.880 --> 47:13.680
break out into a questionnaire Susan Wolf's idea of being connected to something larger than yourself.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.880
Right. What that metaphor means is, well, people want this thing,

47:18.800 --> 47:22.560
like they want it to be in the universe, even if they're not, it's not, it's not in any way

47:22.560 --> 47:29.520
bound to their egocentric preferences. Right. Right. And then the next one is, right. It can't

47:29.520 --> 47:34.480
be fraudulent. It can't be mere appearance. It can't be superficial. It has to have significance

47:34.480 --> 47:39.760
in depth. And then, and then the next is, but we have to be connected to it. We have to make a

47:39.760 --> 47:46.480
difference to it. And so, so remember, I agree with everything you said, and I sort of ran through

47:46.480 --> 47:55.280
that, the argument with you about it. But how do you, I'm going to express sympathy. I can express,

47:55.280 --> 48:00.160
and let me buttress this. Okay. So you're, you're in the Axial Revolution. You've got Bella's second

48:00.160 --> 48:06.080
order thinking your, your metacognition has been massively improved by numeracy with what the Greeks

48:06.080 --> 48:11.040
are doing with alphabetic literacy. You've got incipient democracy. So debate is everywhere,

48:11.040 --> 48:15.760
hyper justification, and you've got a shared culture, but many different polices. So you have all

48:15.760 --> 48:21.040
the six social experimentation, and this is really blowing your metacognitive abilities up. Right.

48:21.040 --> 48:27.280
And so you're getting just a tremendous awareness of your capacities for self deception. And then

48:27.280 --> 48:31.840
you're liable to think, oh, you know, and you can see this in Plato, you can, you can even see it

48:31.840 --> 48:36.400
outside of Greece. You can see it like in the Dhammapada, but, you know, the right and things

48:36.400 --> 48:41.840
like this, that, you know, this realization about how much of our suffering and violence is due to

48:41.840 --> 48:49.440
this self deceptive proclivity of the mind. And then you could start to conceive of a world that,

48:50.880 --> 48:55.840
how the world would be if you weren't looking at it through that torture of self deception and

48:55.840 --> 49:01.600
self destruction. And then you could plug into this, this other thing we said, you've got that's,

49:01.600 --> 49:06.560
it's being connected to that is deeply meaningful to you. And you somehow have a sense of it being

49:06.560 --> 49:14.400
beyond your life, right, and beyond your egocentric concerns. And so I'm not justifying, I'm trying

49:14.400 --> 49:19.280
to play with an explanation with you. It's very tempting to give into a two rules mythology,

49:19.280 --> 49:23.680
that is just such a wonderful way of explaining all of that and drawing it together.

49:25.200 --> 49:31.840
Yeah, no, that's right. And I think, you know, they're, they're different cultural forms

49:32.400 --> 49:40.640
that, that that takes. So, you know, say in India, where in the, you know, the Vedas, we don't really

49:40.640 --> 49:48.160
see the, the idea of rebirth or, or, you know, reincarnation, as we sometimes say, we, we have

49:48.160 --> 49:55.120
a cosmology in which, you know, there may be, you know, higher, more divine kind of transformative

49:55.120 --> 50:02.640
states or possibilities after death that have to do with, with divinities and, and, you know,

50:02.640 --> 50:08.960
the sort of sacred order of the cosmos. And then we have this idea that we have this sort of

50:08.960 --> 50:15.840
ethicization of action, where the idea is, you know, if you act, you know, in a good way, then,

50:15.840 --> 50:20.320
you know, the possibility of a more refined transformative after death state is open to

50:20.320 --> 50:26.240
you. If you act in a bad way, then it's going to go worse for you after death. And, and so we,

50:26.240 --> 50:30.880
we have this sort of, you could say kind of two world, if we, if we slice it in terms of, you

50:30.880 --> 50:37.440
know, life here and what happens after, you know, after death. And then we have the idea that

50:39.120 --> 50:43.760
of karma that we see really first in the Upanishads, where it's, you know, because of desire,

50:43.760 --> 50:48.400
you're actually thrown back from that other world into this world. And then it goes round and round

50:48.720 --> 50:53.040
and that becomes an existential problem that has to be, you know, has to be solved. And then we get,

50:53.040 --> 50:59.120
you know, the different solutions to it on the part of, you know, Buddhism and, and,

50:59.120 --> 51:03.520
you know, the Buddhist teachings or, or what later come to be called Hindu teachings.

51:03.520 --> 51:09.920
So that's all part of this axial, this axial transformation in our, in our consciousness,

51:09.920 --> 51:15.280
in our metacognition, in our cosmology, in our ethics, definitely. And

51:15.280 --> 51:19.040
well, let me phrase the question. Since we've landed on sort of a, I like the way you broadened

51:19.040 --> 51:24.960
it, because I want the cross, cross contextual, cross historical, right? Given that something

51:24.960 --> 51:34.000
like that, let's like, like that, how do we preserve the recognizable gains? There's a

51:34.000 --> 51:39.920
change in the notion of wisdom to, to, like you said, this, this kind of liberation, maybe escape,

51:39.920 --> 51:44.640
but transformation from, you know, maybe a bronze age, you know, Taylor talks about,

51:44.640 --> 51:48.880
you know, the continuous cosmos and you're trying to fit in and harmonize, right? It's a,

51:48.880 --> 51:54.800
it's a very, it's a very different notion of wisdom. How do we preserve what was gained

51:55.360 --> 51:58.640
by us? And you know, I'm going to obviously ask the same thing when we come to the scientific

51:58.640 --> 52:07.200
revolution. How do we, how do we preserve what was gained by the axial revolution? Well, can we,

52:07.280 --> 52:10.800
can we preserve that? Let's say we, we agree we want to preserve it. I'm presuming here,

52:10.800 --> 52:14.160
but let's say we want to preserve a lot of what was gained by that, all the metacognitive

52:14.160 --> 52:19.280
enhancements, all the sense of individual responsibility, right? Etc. The realization

52:19.280 --> 52:23.920
of self deception, the possibility of self correction. How do we, how do we maintain all

52:23.920 --> 52:28.880
of that? Or can we, I'll phrase it a question, better question, can we maintain all of that? And

52:29.840 --> 52:34.240
I don't know, tear it free. And I'm trying to use a somewhat violent metaphor from

52:34.240 --> 52:38.800
the two worlds of mythology. I mean, it's, it's almost, and, and, and, you know, part of this

52:38.800 --> 52:43.840
also plugs into even our, you know, our conceptual metaphors and our embodiment, real is more up,

52:44.560 --> 52:49.680
less real is down. And like, I'm peeling up today and you're looking down at all this kind of language

52:49.680 --> 52:56.480
and we abstract and the abstract is above and the concrete is like, like it's, it's, it's so woven

52:56.480 --> 53:02.640
culturally and even like into, you know, plugs into our embodiment in a powerful way.

53:03.280 --> 53:08.400
I think we can, but I want to hear what you, do you perceive the difficulty of the problem?

53:08.400 --> 53:16.960
Oh, certainly. I mean, that is, that is a huge question. You might say a part of the big historical

53:16.960 --> 53:21.760
question for our, for our times and the, and the, you know, the crisis of meaning that we

53:21.760 --> 53:27.360
face as, as you've talked about it. And, and I see it, you know, it's hard not to sort of go

53:27.360 --> 53:34.320
Hegelian here, but, but I'm going to give in to the temptation. I see it, I see it in a way as,

53:35.680 --> 53:38.000
you know, that was a, that was a hugely transformative

53:41.040 --> 53:48.480
revolution, let's call it, you know, the Axial Revolution. And we might also think that things

53:48.480 --> 53:53.280
were lost in that. So we might think that a certain relationship to the natural world

53:54.160 --> 54:03.920
was lost. And we're now especially conscious of the need to restore some viable,

54:05.840 --> 54:10.240
I'll even say sustainable, though it's become a buzzword, some viable, sustainable relationship

54:10.240 --> 54:17.760
between the human and the, and the rest of the biosphere that requires, I think, an affirmation

54:17.760 --> 54:23.520
of the, the, the specialness of our earth environment. You know, yes, there are in, so

54:23.520 --> 54:27.760
Marcelo Gleiser's book, The Dawn of a Mindful Universe is about this. It's, you know, yes,

54:27.760 --> 54:32.880
there are, you know, inordinately many planets out there that might be able to support life,

54:32.880 --> 54:39.520
but a critical examination also suggests that there might actually be very, very few that have

54:39.520 --> 54:43.840
life. And if life is a special thing that's happened here, at least in the way that it's

54:43.920 --> 54:50.480
happened here, then, you know, the sacred and ultimate concern has to involve our being in

54:50.480 --> 54:56.240
relationship to the, to the biosphere. And we have to do it in a way that involves all of the

54:56.240 --> 55:02.720
ethical cognitive gains that we made as a were of, from the Axial Revolution, you know, telescoping,

55:02.720 --> 55:06.880
you know, huge historical time here. But we also have to do it in a way that recovers a kind of

55:08.080 --> 55:12.560
sensibility to the, and relationship to the natural world that there would have been

55:12.560 --> 55:18.080
pre-agricultural, at least according to some historical narratives. We need, we don't, we

55:18.080 --> 55:23.680
can't go back to that, of course, that's absurd, but we need to recover something of that in a new,

55:23.680 --> 55:30.080
so the way this is Hegelian is it's like a higher turn of the spiral. This would be how my dad would

55:30.080 --> 55:35.520
have put it, actually, is that, you know, you have this course, a recourse of history, and you never

55:35.520 --> 55:40.000
repeat the same thing, but there are patterns where at a certain turning of the spiral, you

55:40.000 --> 55:46.640
actually can look down and see, you know, the axial turn, you know, the, the, the, the turn that

55:46.640 --> 55:51.040
would have been or the curve that would have been before the axial. And from that perspective, you

55:51.040 --> 55:57.360
need to, you need to recover things that were lost because there's always something lost as well

55:57.360 --> 56:01.280
when you, when you have a, when you have a gain. And that, you know, the amazing thing about science,

56:01.280 --> 56:06.160
just to bring it back to the book for a moment, is that, you know, with, with things like the

56:06.160 --> 56:12.560
Gaia theory and earth system science, we've opened up a whole new appreciation of, you know, that we

56:12.560 --> 56:17.280
don't live on the planet, we live in the planet that were embedded at so many levels in the very

56:17.280 --> 56:26.800
fabric of life on the planet. And that is it, is it, you know, to really, to really be with that in a,

56:26.800 --> 56:32.720
in a, in an ethical way requires a kind of profound, I think, change in our, in our sensibility,

56:33.600 --> 56:40.800
that, that science gives us some of the tools for not all of them, but some of them. And the other

56:40.800 --> 56:46.320
things are going to need to come from, you know, larger perspectives of ethics and the sacred,

56:48.480 --> 56:52.480
you know, religion and spirituality, art. I mean, the world is a lot bigger than science,

56:52.480 --> 56:59.760
right, the human cultural world. Yeah. Well, that brings up two things. One is, of course,

57:00.320 --> 57:05.440
I assume you're making a similar argument about the scientific revolution that there was a lot

57:05.440 --> 57:08.720
lost. I mean, that's what the book is saying. That's right. That's right. And, but you're not

57:08.720 --> 57:16.880
proposing nostalgia. I get that. Definitely not. And so the thing you said about that, that, that met,

57:16.880 --> 57:24.480
that, so it's not only a looking back through the eyes of history, it's also looking around

57:24.480 --> 57:30.720
through eyes other than the eyes of science, art, ritual, all different ways of knowing,

57:30.720 --> 57:37.360
different ways of being together, of being in the world, looking, you know, looking from within,

57:37.360 --> 57:41.760
not looking at, but looking from within nature, Ursula Goodnuff's notion of transcendence into

57:41.760 --> 57:50.560
nature, things like that. And so Whitehead had this idea that we need to recover, almost in Tolkien's

57:50.640 --> 57:59.600
sense of recover, we need to recover art and ritual and all of this and somehow bring it back

57:59.600 --> 58:05.680
into having a proper role within our epistemological and ontological endeavors. That's clearly

58:05.680 --> 58:11.040
sort of a thing that Whitehead is arguing. Does that land for you too? Oh, definitely. Yeah.

58:11.040 --> 58:15.360
Okay. Okay. And here's where we're maybe trespassing on Matt's work, Matt Seagal,

58:15.360 --> 58:20.000
especially his most recent book. But you know, and this where I'm influenced somewhat by

58:20.000 --> 58:25.600
Habermas, right? You know, Kant basically severs the true and the good and the beautiful from each

58:25.600 --> 58:30.400
other in really powerful ways with the three critiques and the autonomy arguments for each one

58:30.400 --> 58:38.000
of those. And you know, Kant is sort of looming in places in the book here and there. Because

58:38.720 --> 58:44.800
you're rejecting both the kind of old Platonism and simple Kantianism about things like math.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.920
We'll probably get into that in the next conversation. I don't know if we'll get to it now.

58:48.640 --> 58:54.080
But I'm trying to get at what would, at least in a preliminary fashion, and I'm not trying

58:54.080 --> 58:57.840
to pin you here. You know, I'm your friend. I want to talk to you about this. How would you

58:57.840 --> 59:02.960
address? I mean, that's a hard problem. It's a hard problem. I mean, Habermas has been wrestling with

59:02.960 --> 59:10.960
it. He wrestled with it, sorry, right? To, you know, overcoming those arguments that give us the

59:10.960 --> 59:15.600
autonomy of the true, the good and beautiful. We have a sense, you know, and David Schindler has

59:15.600 --> 59:20.560
been arguing about how they're actually convertible and all that sort of stuff. But how would you,

59:20.560 --> 59:29.920
where would you, where would you go to, like, I'm trying to make, I'm trying to make Kant the

59:29.920 --> 59:37.280
impediment that you have to address right now. But that's not all of his work, but just this move

59:37.280 --> 59:47.840
about, right, the, you know, the separation and making autonomous, including making the

59:47.840 --> 59:52.880
individual autonomous with each one of the, within each one of these autonomies of, you know, because

59:52.880 --> 59:59.840
of the three critiques. That seems to me like a really powerful thing to be trying to wrestle with

59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.280
philosophically. And the book has a philosophical edge to it. You represent that.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:08.800
Yeah, that's an interesting question. I hadn't quite thought of it in those

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:19.760
Kantian terms. I suppose my, you know, my philosophical sensibility is so informed by

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.800
phenomenology in the sort of, you know, sense coming from, from, from this role. And

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:35.840
it doesn't, there's, there's a way of talking about truth, where it's very easy to think of

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:42.000
truth as different from the beautiful say. And that's because we think of truth in terms of the

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.280
correctness of propositions. And we have, we have an idea of correctness really, or of, or of

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:54.800
correspondence. But from a phenomenological perspective, that actually is a secondary sense

01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:04.880
of truth. And the primary sense of truth is, is disclosure, or presence, or the, to be, you

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.720
know, technical in the way that Husserl uses the terminology, the, you know, the evidencing

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.080
of something. So evidencing is the, you know, we use evidence as a noun in English. We think

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.000
here's a piece of evidence, but, but in other languages, evidencing has this verbal sense,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.640
where you, you disclose something, you, you uncover it, you reveal it, it comes to presence,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.120
you know, Heidegger tries to talk about this in terms of his, his sort of etymological

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:36.880
reconstruction of the, you know, the Greek sense of unconcealment of Aletheia, you know,

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.200
Lethe is the concealment, the alpha privative Aletheia is the unconcealment. So there's this

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.480
opening, this, the space of unconcealment and openness. And it's within that space that you

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.040
can then say, in terms of a proposition you might assert that you put in quotation marks,

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:56.720
oh, that proposition that you just said, it's correct. That happens against this other sense of

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.240
truth, which is, you know, unconcealment, presence, openness, evidence, disclosure, you know, however

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.560
you want to, however you want to put it. So within that context, it's very difficult to make a

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:16.160
separation between the, the, the, the, the, the sense of truth as unconcealment and say,

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:25.440
the beautiful or other aesthetic, aesthetic properties for that matter, or the just. And

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.760
so if we think of it that way, we are in a sense going back before Kant, you might say, well,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.440
that's going back before the critical philosophy of Kant and, and thinking in, you know, a more

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.120
Greek way. That's fine. As long as we do it, having taken, you know, the knowledge and the

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:48.160
message, if we want to simplify things of Kant on board, you know, it's like, we're not going back

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.880
in some nostalgic way in the way that Heidegger often writes, in a way that I find actually

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.760
very distasteful, this kind of nostalgic, artificial German, German romantic sort of

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.320
projection back into the ancient world. No, we're not doing that. We're, we're taking what

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:08.480
we've learned from Kant, but we're moving forward in the way that, say, phenomenologists have taught

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:20.240
us to, taught us to do, where again, the, the, the, let's say, the horizon of experience as,

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:28.000
as, as presence is the, is the, is the context within which we're, we're going to be talking,

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.480
where those distinctions don't, can't, can't be made hard and fast in the way that they might

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.360
have been done, right, in, for, for the Kantian purposes. I want to play with that a little bit.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:44.400
I like that, because I've done similar play, you know, Rikur talks about the hermeneutics of

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.280
suspicion and that, and I've made the argument the hermeneutics of suspicion is parasitic

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.800
on what I call the hermeneutics of beauty. The hermeneutics of suspicion is

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.560
appearances are distorting, misleading, they, they conceal deception, blah, blah. But the

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:04.000
hermeneutics of beauty, at least, some people are talking about beauty is, well, no, but there

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.240
have to be situations in which appearances disclose reality, that appearances is not a veil, right,

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.400
the way, that's an enlightenment ideal, but, and that beauty is when we're getting a sense,

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.880
and this, and, and Skari does this in her book on beauty, that it's what we're getting a sense of,

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.680
oh, oh, it's, and it's, it's bound up with almost like that insight moment where you realize, oh,

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.160
I haven't been seeing this as, as, as, as it is. And then, so that's beauty, but then that you're

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.800
already also in like the truth, but you're also getting into this other thing, this sort of,

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.600
and you get this research from people who have, look at the Griffith lab and others, I know you're

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.360
familiar with this research, and they have the experience, the noetic experience of the really

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:47.520
real, and it seems to have a kind of normativity to them, right, right, that, and it's just, it's

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:53.600
just in the fact that it's real, that it's normatively binding on them, like, and they,

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.480
they transform their lives and their relationships, and they're not guided by at least a Kantian sense

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:03.200
of being more moral, and they're not, right, but they're guided, but nevertheless, by this sense

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.000
of a goodness, I call it, onto normativity, just to give a name to it, somehow there's a goodness

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:15.280
to reality, that, and, and you're nodding, you might be just being polite, but is that

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:20.080
sort of the kind of thing you're talking about, where you start to unpack these kind of things,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.800
and you start to say, well, no, you know, there's a sense of beauty as appearance is disclosing

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:30.080
something underneath them, which relates to truth as disclosure, and then there's a sense of goodness

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:36.480
as, you know, this contact with the really real as something that's sort of an ur normativity for

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:43.600
us. Is that? Yeah, very much so. I mean, I think, you know, in addition to beauty, I would, I would

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:56.000
invoke awe and wonder. Sure, of course. Yeah, yeah. I think that it's impossible to separate those

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.080
things phenomenologically in, in those kinds of experiences and situations that, that people

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:07.760
have, including, including science, right? Yeah, I mean, you read what, you know, you read Einstein,

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:16.320
you know, writing about, about the, the, the, the worldview that he has as a scientist and the,

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:23.520
and, and some of his own, you know, experiences in thinking about his scientific work. You read

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:29.840
historical, you know, scientific figures throughout, throughout history, and, and they all, you know,

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:37.040
express or many of them express this, this sense of, you know, awe and, and, and wonder and amazement

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:44.480
and, and, you know, a feeling of the good transformative insight. And I think there's a deep

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:48.240
connection. So I'm really going to lay my cards on the table because I know I can do that with you.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.560
But I mean, for me, I, I, I'm very much

01:06:52.800 --> 01:07:02.000
drawn to mysticism in, as a mode of understanding what's happening there. I think of, you know,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.760
science and mysticism as, as deeply linked throughout history in, in, in, in philosophical,

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:14.400
cultural and, and, you know, personality ways in terms of individual scientists where,

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:19.280
you know, mysticism is this, I think of mysticism almost as a kind of epistemic

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:28.880
humility. It's that, you know, the world is, is vast. It's unfathomable. And that there are modes of

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.040
knowing is not even the right word. There are modes of being in which there is a felt

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:42.800
oneness or unity that can be expressed in enumably different ways in, you know, in, in science,

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.480
in art, in philosophy, and, and mysticism, you know, so, so going back to the sacred,

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.160
I think of it as a kind of, you know, the need for kind of imminent mysticism, a mysticism of,

01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.360
you know, here and now in this planet, you know, with, with, with the needs that, that face us as

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.240
a species and as a, as a civilization, as a scientific civilization. So I see the mystic as

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.520
really almost the, the, you know, the guardian, the reminder, the reminderer, the, the sort of

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.280
watch person for that sensibility. Yeah.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.480
Well, I think you know that I agree with that quite deeply. A lot of my work is about trying

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:28.080
to get these two to speak together. And in your own book, The Blind Spot, I was noting the many

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.120
places where you explained why this was chosen by the scientists, especially in the history

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.840
chapter, because it was elegant, because it was beautiful, because it was simple. I mean, there's

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.560
a problem with the notion of simple. We act as if it's a cleanly, cleanly determinable thing,

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:47.600
but it's not right. And stuff like that. But there, yeah, there was this tremendous sense of how

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:56.400
much that is how that is, you know, driving, motivating and justifying the moves that these

01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:00.640
scientists are making historically. Yeah. And even, you know, as people have written about,

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.080
just, you know, just to balance things that that can sometimes lead us astray, you know, we can get

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.520
caught up in the beauty of the mathematical constructions in a way where we lose, we lose

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.720
contact with how the world actually is talking back to us. And we, you know, we depart from

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:26.080
any real possibility of experiential grounding or confirmation or support. I mean, this happens.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.360
You know, so I'm, you know, Marcelo and Adam could talk much more articulately about this,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.240
but you know, this happens in, in areas of physics, you know, in string theory or, you know,

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.400
the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and how people just are willing to

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.480
run with its metaphysical implications in this sort of profligated indiscriminate way. So that's

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.920
sort of the flip side is you can get, you can get fascinated by constructions that have a kind of

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:55.760
beauty, but that are, but that are misleading in certain ways. For sure. For sure. And

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.920
it's interesting that maybe we'll leave to when they're present to talk about this more in depth,

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:08.160
but you can see sort of both of these impulses, right? You, yeah, you can get the rabbit holding

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.720
that goes on with strings theory and multiple worlds. And it's just one electron moving all

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.440
through time and space, encountering itself and like, what, how could you possibly determine that

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:24.640
or given empirical content of that claim? And then, but the other, like there, there is something,

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:30.800
and I hear that the, the, maybe I'll call, I'll be poetic, the whisper of the mystic in the,

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.400
in this drive to unify the very, very bottom with the very, very top, the cosmos,

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.280
relativity with quantum. And it's like, you know, if there was ever a falsification of

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.120
popper, there's a falsification. We've had the best minds and the best technique, and they keep

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:49.520
making this hypothesis and it keeps getting reliably disconfirmed and they, that doesn't matter.

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:56.400
They just keep going and they just keep going. And I think that's powerful. Yeah. I wouldn't

01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:03.520
want to. I, I'm very, I, I try to make a distinction between the wisdom that mysticism

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:10.080
can give us and any particular ontological or epistemological knowledge claims that are made.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.600
And the first, I think, I take very seriously the second, I, I agree with quite a bit of

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:23.840
suspicion. Right. And, and, and I think that's important. Well, I just want to, I want to wrap

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:31.520
up for today. And we're, we're, I think this was great. We're really unpacking things really nicely,

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.600
very dialogically, the way I like, I want to talk to you next time, just to forewarn.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:41.840
I want to talk to you around, about these issues, about abstraction. And you mean,

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:46.960
you make a wonderful correction, or at least amendment cameras at the end of chapter one

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.680
or chapter two, you talk about, well, you say, actually, we mean more or less abstract or more

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:55.680
or less concrete, because the terms are actually relative and comparative, right? You know,

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.400
the dog is more abstract than the cocker spaniel, but the mammals more abstract than the dog and,

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.000
right, and all that sort of thing. And I want to unpack that a little bit more.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:10.160
And how does that plug into this notion of more, more real, as you're more closer to the

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:14.240
inexhaustible fount of intelligibility. And then there's this other one about,

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.080
you know, direct experience, immediate pure experience. And, you know, and then you're

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.400
familiar with this, no doubt. These are criticisms made by others against people like Nishida and

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.240
the Kyoto schools, you know, and hey, Gillians would make this argument. What? What do you mean?

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:34.000
There's no, there's all experience is mediated. That's the gain from the Kantian Revolution.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.600
That's the thing you're doing where you're trying to go back before it can't, you're giving up the

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.480
realization that everything is mediated in some fashion. And there's no such thing as immediate

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.200
experience or direct experience. Right. Does that sound like a fecundary to go into it?

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.360
Yeah, definitely. I mean, immediate, immediate is like abstract concrete. It's, you know,

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.560
there's, yeah, yeah, exactly. There's a contextual issue there as to what,

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.800
what immediate versus immediate means just as there is for abstract concrete. But yeah,

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.120
no, those are all important things to talk about. Definitely. Yeah, yeah. Excellent. Excellent.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:11.280
Well, Evan, first of all, I'm going to thank you. This has been just fantastic. Thanks.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.080
I had great expectations and it exceeded them. I really enjoyed myself a lot. I hope you did.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.000
Yeah, definitely. Lots of fun. And I definitely want you back. Let's have the next one just be you

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.320
and I again. Okay. And then maybe we, you could reach out to your co-authors and we could set up

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.080
maybe a third and fourth with all of us together. Yeah. We might need a little bit more time for

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:38.160
those episodes just to give more space for more people to be able to chime in. But I always like

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:42.320
to give my, you know this from when you were on the philosophy of meditation, we'd like to give

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.640
the people here the last word. It can be provocative. It can be summative. It can be

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.960
mysteriously evocative. Whatever you want it to be. I don't know if I have a, if I have a last word

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.840
of that, of that nature, other than just to say it's always lots of fun to talk with you. And,

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.000
and yeah, you know, I've really enjoyed the conversation. Yeah.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.120
All right. So then I'll give the last word. I'm going to plug the book again. Okay. Really.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.680
This book, if you are interested in the meeting crisis, if you're interested in, well,

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.400
relevance realization, that's in the book too. If you're interested in all of these issues,

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:24.000
we'll be talking about the sacred, about, you know, the fact that somehow we need to be put back

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.720
into the scientific worldview, but that means changing what we mean by a scientific worldview.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.480
And you should be interested if you're watching this video, because I've been talking about those

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.600
things for five years, at least in this space, and I don't know, 20 years at the university. So

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:45.200
you should definitely buy the book. Again, very clearly written, accessible without being a dumbing

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:49.520
down. It's a nice stepping down without being a dumbing down. I highly recommend the book.

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.240
Go out and get it. It's not expensive. It's a great read. And thank you very much again, Evan.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.240
Just great pleasure. Thank you.
