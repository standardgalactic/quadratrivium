0	2800	Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Reveke.
2800	4640	I'm very excited about this.
4640	8000	We're back again with Teri Dentry and her ongoing work
8000	10800	and this ongoing video series.
10800	12480	Many of you have been reaching out
12480	14680	about wanting to participate in this work
14680	15880	in one way or another.
15880	17520	And I wanted to, I'll do this again,
17520	21360	but I wanted to thank many of you for your interest in that.
21360	23680	We also have Aspezia Gera George with us,
23680	26680	and she already knows Teri.
26680	29360	I've just, before we turn on the camera,
29520	32080	I've been getting to know her, she's very charming.
32080	36120	And I look forward to us opening this up,
36120	40680	getting back into these deep issues around chronic pain,
40680	43360	the medic crisis, the meeting crisis,
43360	46360	and issues around, you know,
46360	48200	interprofessional practice,
48200	49720	dialogical reasoning.
49720	50760	Many of these topics,
50760	53720	we're weaving them all together in powerful ways.
53720	57040	And Aspezia is going to give us
57120	61320	more of a clinical therapeutic dimension,
61320	63200	but I mentioned she'll also want to talk about
63200	65800	some of these far-reaching dimensions.
65800	67400	So welcome, both ladies.
67400	69280	And I'll turn things over to Teri.
70600	71440	Thank you, John.
71440	72920	That was a great introduction.
72920	75320	And I also welcome Aspezia.
75320	78520	I've got to know Aspezia over the last 12 months.
78520	80520	Again, someone I've met through VoiceCraft.
80520	84120	So a wonderful place to actually meet like-minded people.
85120	88920	And yeah, through our discussions, our earlier discussions,
88920	90440	we were talking about, of course,
90440	93200	my research work in chronic pain.
93200	96800	And Aspezia has a clinical background
96800	99840	and works as a clinical psychologist.
99840	102440	And we've come to understand
102440	106160	that we have some very similar feelings and thoughts
106160	108600	when we do think about chronic pain,
108600	112040	and especially the term socialization of pain,
112160	115080	which is something that John and I have been talking about
115080	116160	to quite some length.
116160	119440	And I'm really excited to talk to Aspezia about that today
119440	122800	and actually how potentially rationality
122800	125800	fits into the way that we actually think
125800	128520	about that socialization of pain.
128520	132600	So I'm going to let Aspezia introduce herself and her work.
133560	135480	Thank you, Teri.
135480	137720	It's a real pleasure to be here with you both.
138720	141760	And John, I did just want to say that
141760	144720	you've formed a very important part of my life.
144720	147720	It's really wonderful to finally meet you.
147720	151840	I think it must have been like six years ago with my baby son.
151840	153600	He had trouble sleeping.
153600	155600	And I used to listen to your lectures
155600	160480	when I was pacing back and forth all night exhausted.
160480	162680	And so to meet you is really special.
162680	165600	So I just wanted to start with that
165600	166920	and to thank you for that.
167120	168360	Thank you.
168360	170040	So yes, I'm a clinical psychologist.
170040	171160	I'm a therapist.
171160	174200	I see people in private practice.
174200	177480	I use a modality called ISTDP.
178640	181920	So it's a psychoanalytically informed modality.
182680	184880	It's very emotion focused.
184880	186560	It's experiential.
186560	190480	So it's all about creating experience in the room with patients.
191600	194240	And it wasn't designed for chronic pain.
194240	198880	It was designed really for depression, anxiety,
198880	200960	personality disorders, that sort of thing.
202160	203560	But it can be used for chronic pain.
203560	207280	So it also relieves chronic pain and somatization
207280	209440	and an array of things.
209440	211600	And we can talk about why.
211600	215040	So I'm, yeah, I'm interested in talking about that in some depth.
216040	219600	I'm interested more broadly in the role of emotions.
220120	223120	I think there's a forgotten landscape.
223120	227520	I think there's an over focus on rationality, cognitions.
228560	230560	And we forget, we forget the emotional landscape
230560	232640	and how to take that into account.
232640	235960	And I think that happens from very early on in life
235960	238800	for reasons we can talk about, but also socially.
239360	242160	I just think it's reinforced socially in the culture.
243200	245080	I don't think there's a strong enough understanding
245080	247760	of what emotions are, how they can be helpful,
248080	250840	how they can be enlivening.
250840	254000	Particular emotions are prioritized over others.
255640	257680	So we can talk about that in a lot of depth.
258520	261520	And also the socialization of pain I'm very interested in.
261840	264960	The idea that, well, what I see all the time
265280	268720	that chronic pain, as well as depression, as well as anxiety,
268760	271520	all of these sufferings, these undue sufferings
272120	274720	actually play a role in relationship.
274720	277640	And this role that they play in relationship reinforces
277880	280480	the symptoms themselves.
280520	282720	And there's a few different ways that I can talk about that.
282720	285800	And probably in some ways that it may be different
285800	289600	to what you've already considered in your conversations.
290600	295000	I think because the model is psychoanalytically informed,
295000	297520	there's a lot of focus on the unconscious
297520	300480	and the role of suppression and repression
301960	304760	and trying to bring the unconscious up into consciousness
304760	306880	as a way to relieve the suffering,
306880	308960	which I think is a really important part of the mix
309680	310960	for a subset of people.
310960	317200	I think more CBT and sort of very general emotional work is enough.
317760	319240	But for many, many people,
319240	321160	there is a lot of unconscious resistance
321160	323280	against experiencing their emotions
324480	326560	and so that they're not aware of.
326560	329160	And so taking time to help them understand
329160	332760	what those defenses against emotional experience are is vital.
333520	335120	And without that, what can often happen
335120	337080	is that symptoms can just move around.
337080	340880	So someone gets some relief to their pain, for example,
341160	343560	but it may be that it manifests somewhere else later on in life
343840	347360	or it now manifests as anxiety in a different context
347360	351040	or depression or sexual problems or all sorts of things.
351400	356040	So so I'm interested, I guess, broadly in emotions,
356040	357760	getting more of a platform,
357760	361040	that is because of the work they do with ISTDP,
361040	363680	which stands for intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy,
364000	370160	the type of therapy developed by Dr. Davenle in the 60s, I believe.
371800	375200	And it's a very, yeah, we can get into the details of it.
375200	377000	But essentially, it looks at
378320	380960	it would look at chronic pain as being a defense
380960	383520	against emotional experience.
383520	386320	And so it's another way that we can avoid
386760	388880	particularly painful emotional experience
388880	390920	that our psyche, for whatever reason,
390920	394760	has decided is too dangerous or threatening to bring into relationship.
395160	397480	So for us to even be aware of internally
397480	400840	and then be to now, how is that going to impact the relationship?
400840	404360	Will this person reject me, punish me, whatever it is for having this feeling?
404640	407840	So all these defensive structures and mechanisms get created.
407840	411360	And ISTDP is really about getting very clear
411360	413920	on what the defensive mechanisms are that are in operation,
414400	417160	bringing that into sort of stark relief for the patient,
417800	422080	highlighting the internal emotional conflict that's going on,
422080	428560	the intracyclic crisis and then helping to push through the resistance
428560	431280	so that some of these feelings can come up and finally be experienced.
431640	433920	And it gets experienced in the room together.
435560	439440	And one more piece I will say is that I have found
440400	444040	that the I think the most confronting part in the resistance
444040	446760	that is greatest is the resistance against the impulse
447160	451600	or the action impulse, the action tendency that comes with an emotional experience.
451920	455480	So it's not just the sensation and the feeling itself in the body
455880	458000	that is resisted against.
458000	461640	In finally letting oneself experience that fully inside,
461640	465200	there is an impulse that comes with it, which is the whole point of an emotion.
466200	469560	And seeing that impulse, recognising that impulse inside ourselves
469560	471040	can be very confronting.
471040	473760	You know, if it's an aggressive impulse to reach out and hurt someone,
474960	476520	that's a very confronting thing to look at.
476520	478840	So there's a lot of resistance around seeing that part of it,
478840	481920	but it's in the seeing that part of it, not the enacting,
482160	484040	but just the noticing inside
485320	489080	that can finally clear up the need for all these defences.
489560	493320	Right. So it just clears up anxiety, clears up depressive symptomology.
493320	498000	It can clear up chronic pain and opens a person up to
498960	502680	also opens a person up to be able to experience their emotions more clearly
502680	507360	and more fully. And that gives them greater potential in their action.
507360	509720	That's what I've found. It gives them more options now.
509720	515040	They have more information to draw from, to integrate with obviously cognitive,
515040	517880	you know, rationale, bringing all that online with the emotions,
518040	521840	working together as opposed to just looking at one part of it
522040	523680	and pushing the emotions down.
523680	527440	And I've said a lot all at once, but that's that's where I'm broadly
527440	530120	interested in how I think it might be relevant.
530120	533280	And I was saying to Terry, too, before this started that
534160	537920	I'm also a researcher and actually I was a researcher before I was a clinician.
537920	541160	So my mind also naturally goes to
542280	545200	how can we like what are the practical implications here?
545200	548040	What is it that we can take from this very complicated model?
548280	550720	You know, that we're not going to be rolling out to everybody.
550960	552760	What can we take from this?
552760	556640	What are the key ingredients that might be useful to OTs, physios, GPs,
556800	560360	you know, nurses, anyone that's coming into contact with someone with chronic pain?
560360	561720	What can they take from it?
561720	564720	So my mind is sort of in all those places at once.
564720	568600	And just more more sort of broadly philosophically as well,
568600	572080	because I've been I've been spending a lot of time at Boyscraft
572080	575000	and those those generative
575000	577600	conversations with that with that core group there.
577600	579760	It's just it's just been wonderful when it's been.
579760	582240	It's really opened me up to all of this in a new way as well.
582240	586000	So those are all my different little lenses that I'm bringing to this.
587520	589160	That was wonderful. Thank you.
589160	592800	So you said it, you said about 20 very interesting things.
593400	596440	So I'm afraid no matter which one I'll pick,
596440	600560	it'll sound like I'm being negligent, but hopefully you'll be you'll be understanding.
601160	603120	So I mean, I.
605080	609320	I frequently say that for ECOGs, I should have two more E's added.
609680	613240	Not only is emotion embodied, embedded, enacted and extended.
613600	616160	It's also emotional and exacted.
617160	623000	And so I and I think there's
623520	626680	I've I've been making an argument for quite a long time
626680	630560	about that that at the core of cognition is something called relevance
630560	633880	realization, but relevance realization is not cold calculation.
634160	636480	It involves caring and involves affect.
636480	638800	It involves arousal, etc.
638800	642240	So I think we're playing in the same ballpark, at least.
643560	644560	So.
647040	648040	In what way.
649880	654120	Does everything you've said connect up with some of the stuff
654120	659040	that Terry has been doing about the degree to which
659240	662120	this is inculturated and socialized.
662440	667080	I would, I, for example, you said you familiar
667080	671520	at least with some of my work, you know, I think being stuck in a Cartesian framework
672000	676440	has particularly exasperated and getting a very getting a very truncated
676440	680640	notion of our rationality means where it goes from a very platonic notion
680640	685000	down to this very logical notion and and their eros is drained out of it.
685800	689320	Deliberately so, by the way, whereas Plato was a great emphasis
689320	691320	on the relationality and the eros.
692840	697920	So in what way does the sort of is the cultural cognitive grammar,
697920	698920	the framework we're in.
699920	704320	Does that I imagine that gets internalized, that that's an impact
704320	708480	or that's an amplifier of the kinds of stuff you're talking about.
708480	710480	Is that is that correct?
710480	711480	How does that land?
711480	713320	What like what comes up when I say that?
714320	716320	Yeah, a lot comes up.
718440	721120	And the answer is yes, that plays a role.
721120	724520	And I see I see it play a role in just so many ways.
725520	730520	First of all, I think I don't think there is there is a grammar for emotions
730520	731520	out there.
731520	734520	Like, I don't think people understand what we mean.
734520	740120	At least as psychologists, when we say an emotion, people automatically go to action.
740120	746320	So if I say to you what what is anger like for you, they go to, oh, it's, you know,
746320	750920	someone lashing out or saying mean things or well, that's an action.
750920	755320	And so the idea that there's even any sensation in the body is a beginning point is often
755320	757320	absent from people's minds.
759320	763520	There's there's an idea, you know, this idea out there that we should be controlling our
763520	769520	emotions, which again, really, I think people are talking about actions, but you can't you
769520	776320	can't control the fact that these are biological hardwired signals that occur within us.
776320	778320	We don't have choice over.
778720	780720	Is absent seems to be absent from the mix.
780720	786720	The idea that we that we generate our emotions, we can sort of curate and create this in a
786720	790720	landscape of of joy and only being positive.
790720	798720	All of that being reinforced by things like social media, but also just in family units.
798720	800720	Like, I mean, it starts young.
800720	801720	It's it's in the family unit.
801720	804720	It's oftentimes in the schooling system.
805120	807120	It's oftentimes in the schooling system.
807120	812120	It's often what happens when you go to see a doctor.
812120	815120	It's it's just in culture at large.
815120	822120	And I think a lot of it is about that the prioritizing feeling good and looking like you're
822120	828120	doing well and overriding overriding even just to divide between sort of positive and negative,
828120	830120	you know, that some feelings are good and some are bad.
830520	835520	And they're all vital signals inside us that can tell us something very important.
835520	842520	They have a wisdom to them and that we don't take them seriously in that manner is a real problem.
845520	852520	When it comes to pain specifically, it's quite often the case that people who I see
852520	859520	who have chronic pain issues, once you can get very clear with them how interesting it is
859720	862720	that they also seem to have an absence of emotional experience,
862720	866720	but they have a lot of physical pain.
866720	869720	That can be quite confronting in and of itself.
869720	872720	Is that is that a general trend?
872720	876720	I'm going to speak in a lot of generalities because there's always, you know, I don't want to act
876720	878720	as though there aren't distinctions here.
878720	883720	But yes, in a general sense, what happens is I guess from from an ISTP perspective,
883720	888920	in some of these cases, you have to do I think one thing to say is you have to meet the individual
888920	889920	in front of you.
889920	890920	Of course, of course.
890920	892920	It's very different.
892920	893920	But in general terms.
893920	895920	Just take it that will give you charity around that.
895920	896920	Okay.
896920	898920	I hope others will as well.
898920	899920	Yeah.
899920	900920	Well, they should.
900920	901920	They should.
901920	902920	Okay.
902920	903920	All right.
903920	904920	I appreciate that.
904920	905920	So in a general sense, yes.
905920	910920	I mean, if we're thinking about from an ISTP perspective, if we're thinking about chronic pain here,
910920	916920	operating as a defensive structure to keep the person from noticing that they're having a particular emotion,
916920	921920	and we can talk about why, then they just notice the pain.
921920	924920	The pain operates to keep them from noticing the emotion.
924920	932920	So rather than notice the rage that I might feel towards my partner, right, for, I don't know,
932920	937920	for deciding to leave their job and now putting me in a greater financial sort of burden,
937920	942920	rather than notice that, all of a sudden I've developed some pain in my back, you know,
942920	952920	and now so it's rather than, rather than notice the guilt that I might experience for doing
952920	955920	something that ruptures my relationship with my child.
955920	960920	I just noticed this sort of crushing pain in my, in my arms, right?
960920	964920	Or I notice, you know, pain in my head or in my neck.
964920	971920	So they notice the pain is replacement as a like a distraction from noticing the emotion that precedes it.
971920	977920	So when you can, when you can draw it out and say, wow, you know, as we talk about this and look at the sort of the timeline of this,
977920	982920	it seems like there were really, there were really difficult things happening in your life, you know,
982920	986920	your mother passed away, you lost your job, like all these things.
986920	991920	And then you develop this pain, but I hear nothing about how you felt about any of those things.
991920	992920	I see.
992920	993920	How did you feel?
993920	999920	And to even just notice that they, that's almost the first time they've considered that question.
999920	1003920	And they say, oh, it didn't really bother me that much.
1003920	1004920	You know, my mother had a great life.
1004920	1007920	It was her time to go, you know, it's fine.
1007920	1008920	I get it.
1008920	1009920	I didn't really feel a lot.
1009920	1016920	Or, you know, they give you some watery feeling or they're making it into a positive, positive feeling.
1016920	1025920	You notice that you notice that it lacks the richness of an entire emotional landscape that one might imagine someone would experience if they were going through difficulty.
1025920	1030920	So the pain, so it's like, it's like the same things we would say about anxiety and depression.
1030920	1038920	It's sitting as a, as a cover, as a cover to keep this stuff squashed down so that the person themselves doesn't have contact with it,
1038920	1044920	but also so even if they start to have contact with it, so that would never come out into the relationship.
1044920	1052920	So that you would never let your partner know that you're very angry at them when they keep interrupting you, you know,
1052920	1055920	and you've pointed it out to them several times and they continue to do it.
1055920	1061920	That you feel a great anger inside when they do that, that you believe that that would never bring anything of value to the relationship.
1061920	1064920	But what happens with these emotions is that we, they have to go somewhere.
1064920	1065920	They have to do something.
1065920	1067920	They have their own life.
1067920	1070920	We can't just cut them off and throw them away.
1070920	1075920	So they go underground and they fester and they come out in all sorts of other unconscious ways.
1075920	1081920	And so some ways that we see that in, in ISTDP, especially when it comes to pain,
1081920	1090920	is that the pain itself can be a rerouting of a rage and impulse to hurt someone else instead they experience it on themselves.
1090920	1093920	So there's often, very often a link.
1093920	1100920	Once we do all this work, there's very often a link between the precise location and nature of the pain they're experiencing
1100920	1110920	and the initial impulse that came with the rage in the first place when they were younger, probably against an attachment figure.
1110920	1117920	It's the same, it's the same expression, but they're expressed, it's being expressed in their body rather than to be inflicted on the other.
1117920	1121920	It's a way they protect the other from an impulse to hurt the other.
1121920	1122920	No.
1122920	1123920	Does that make sense?
1123920	1125920	Yeah, it does.
1125920	1126920	And there's a couple.
1126920	1127920	Oh, sorry.
1127920	1128920	Am I interrupting you?
1129920	1132920	So I just want to make sure.
1132920	1139920	So part of what I'm hearing, there's three things I'm hearing.
1139920	1143920	And you can respond to all or none of them or whatever order.
1143920	1146920	I'm hearing like that there's both sort of a vertical dimension.
1146920	1156920	You know, emotions are a signal about what's going on, but there's also this horizontal dimension of if I'm connected or not to external reality.
1156920	1157920	Right.
1157920	1164920	And either I'm trying to not admit something about the world or I'm trying to hold myself back from interacting with the world in a certain way.
1164920	1176920	And this goes with sort of the idea of, which I think has got merit to it, that emotions are sort of this nexus between these two axes of connection, embodied connection and embedded connection.
1176920	1181920	This is why I think the E of emotion should be added to embodied and embedded.
1181920	1184920	So first of all, what you think about that.
1184920	1188920	And then there was, I like this, this idea.
1188920	1197920	I don't, I don't, I don't want to, I don't know quite what the word semiotic or symbolic that where it is, isn't just happenstance.
1197920	1207920	There's some kind of meaning to it that and confronting the meaning is part of the issue as well.
1207920	1209920	And then the third is a question.
1209920	1211920	So those are my two observations.
1211920	1214920	And please let me know if I'm tracking you well.
1214920	1222920	And then the other one is, is it given sort of how we got into this with my original question.
1222920	1231920	When you're doing therapy, is there an element of cultural critique that has to come up that you have to challenge people in terms of these cultural frameworks and give them the tools.
1232920	1240920	Because like you said, they're going out and you're saying something for an hour in therapy and then they're going out with four hours on social media.
1240920	1242920	And do you see what I'm saying?
1242920	1247920	It sounds like it's in some ways the games rigged against you.
1247920	1249920	And how do you deal with that?
1249920	1250920	And what do you do?
1250920	1252920	Do you have to do things, cultural critique?
1252920	1256920	Do you have to empower them to challenge those cultural imperatives?
1256920	1258920	So two observations and a question.
1258920	1259920	I hope that wasn't too much.
1259920	1260920	Oh, amazing.
1260920	1263920	I'm going to start with the last one.
1263920	1277920	Because what happens, John, is that if if when this is when this is done and it goes well from my point of view, it's all it's all about the individual and I in the room.
1277920	1278920	Right.
1278920	1283920	And it's it's less so about maybe like a CBT style.
1283920	1286920	It's psycho education.
1286920	1288920	Let's talk about the theory.
1288920	1294920	It's all about trying to give the experience in the room to this person of what we're talking about.
1294920	1295920	Right.
1295920	1297920	To show them here and now together.
1297920	1298920	Right.
1298920	1307920	If we pay attention right now to your pain, what happens that using the relationship and using the here and now to give to help them see the gaps.
1307920	1314920	And to see that actually something might be off here and the way I've been approaching this and understanding this everywhere else.
1314920	1317920	But we keep it very much about the experience in the room.
1317920	1321920	And I guess it's a corrective emotional experience that is taking place.
1321920	1322920	And you're right.
1322920	1324920	It is just one hour and they go back out into the world.
1324920	1332920	But it is amazing how making it experiential in the room trans starts to translate out into the world anyway.
1332920	1337920	Without me needing to say now you need to take this out and do that.
1337920	1350920	Because otherwise the problem is otherwise you get into a game of talking and intellectualizing and an over rational and now you get into that same arena again that is part of the problem for many of these people.
1350920	1364920	Part of their defensive structure is they like to think and talk about things and go up here a lot and make lots of connections in their brain without actually consulting their body first without going in and noticing what is that what is the truth of the emotion here.
1364920	1370920	Even if I don't want to see it even if it's going to be disruptive to a relationship I'm in.
1370920	1379920	And the part that you said at the end of your question about empowering them what generally happens is once we get on the other side of that in the room they are empowered themselves.
1379920	1380920	I don't have to do anything.
1380920	1382920	It opens up.
1382920	1388920	There's this thing called the unconscious therapeutic alliance and it sort of takes over in this person.
1388920	1393920	The healthy part just sort of takes over and they are opened up and they know what to do now.
1393920	1394920	They are empowered.
1394920	1395920	I don't give them any advice.
1395920	1400920	I don't say to them oh you should probably leave your wife or not leave your wife or it's clear to them on the other side of it.
1400920	1402920	They don't need me for that.
1402920	1408920	They don't need another person in their life listing out the pros and cons of what you could do in the situation.
1408920	1422920	Their problem is a blockage and access to vital signals that might help them to to see more clearly what is going on for them and in relationship and through seeing more clearly and having access to these more vital signals.
1422920	1426920	They can integrate that into their thinking faculties which most of them have no problem with.
1426920	1433920	The people I see John are highly intellectual people.
1433920	1437920	They don't need more help from me about how to think.
1437920	1445920	They oftentimes put all those pieces together themselves on the other side of it and that is beautiful to see because that actually is part of the healing.
1445920	1450920	But they can say wow I can just figure that I figured this out now and I have I have agency in the world.
1450920	1457920	I don't need my therapist to tell me what I should or shouldn't do in this relationship or how I how I should feel about social media.
1457920	1459920	It's just clear to me now that yeah.

1480920	1484920	Yeah one pin in it quickly.
1484920	1493920	So that last move really was helpful to me just before you address the other two that notion of sort of recovery or restoration of agency.
1493920	1495920	That seems to be like an important thing.
1495920	1498920	So that's what I was asking for.
1498920	1500920	I wasn't necessarily like.
1500920	1510920	I was like but something has changed such that they can go out and confront a world that is in some ways driven them into your into your office in the first place.
1510920	1523920	And it sounds like there's a restoration of agency in some and this is a theme that Terry and I have been really trying to explore what that what that is and how that how that how that sort of comes online.
1523920	1530920	I just wanted to put a pin in that because for me that that really helped me connect your answer to my question.
1530920	1536920	But you wanted to respond to the other two points about emotion as the nexus and the symbolic aspect.
1536920	1538920	Yes.
1538920	1542920	But I'm tempted just to respond to the point you just made now as well.
1542920	1543920	Do what you wish.
1543920	1544920	Do what you wish.
1544920	1545920	I will.
1545920	1552920	It links really nicely to me with me to a conversation that I had with with Daniel Garner of OG Rose recently.
1552920	1559920	We were talking about something similar to do with emotions and this distinction about about agency that you're talking about.
1559920	1572920	So what it seems like to me happens is that in highlighting because really what we're doing in ISTP is we're highlighting the conflictual nature of the internal emotional landscape.
1572920	1581920	It's about the fact that there are complex mixed feelings in there towards people who we both love and at times might feel intense rage and want to rip their head off.
1581920	1582920	Right.
1582920	1583920	How does one right.
1583920	1589920	How does one have that experience inside without thinking there's something wrong with them or you know self attacking or trying yet.
1589920	1601920	So what this work does is it really highlights on the other side of it highlights for a person that they have complex mixed feelings inside themselves that they have.
1601920	1611920	They can have two parts sort of you know together at once and then they get then they can choose how to act.
1611920	1614920	They don't have to act from the rage part you know.
1614920	1619920	And so the agency comes and this is sort of more wording that came from from Daniel.
1619920	1622920	But the agency I think comes from noticing.
1622920	1626920	Oh there is something inside that is complicated.
1626920	1628920	Now I get to choose how I act.
1628920	1635920	So that is the distinguishing point as opposed to trying to edit the internal landscape to precisely match how they're acting.
1635920	1636920	If that makes sense.
1636920	1637920	It doesn't.
1637920	1647920	That there is something inside that I can wrestle with and which to make a choice from that allows me to feel I have an ability to make choice as opposed to the other way around.
1647920	1652920	And I think the problem with pain is that pain is read as oh this is just a thing in my body.
1652920	1654920	This isn't an emotional experience.
1654920	1655920	Because there's nothing yet.
1655920	1656920	Yeah.
1656920	1658920	But that's the pivot point I'm trying to get at.
1658920	1663920	Because like one of the one of the one of the things.
1663920	1666920	Well I from my side I feel like I'm wrestling with.
1666920	1679920	I mean theoretically is you know the association of emotion with passion where passion means exactly the loss of agency and being overtaken and pain also.
1679920	1680920	Yeah.
1680920	1681920	Right.
1681920	1682920	We suffer pain.
1682920	1683920	Right.
1683920	1687920	And I'm just sort of seeing like is there a connection there that right.
1687920	1701920	There's there like it's like you have when people when people move out of you know the passivity of pain and they get away and they see that emotions can actually right afford their agency.
1701920	1704920	And see that's what I'm sort of hearing is sorry.
1704920	1706920	This is just right.
1706920	1707920	Right.
1708920	1710920	Does that make does that make sense.
1710920	1715920	Because like one of the things I bump up against when I try to teach students about.
1715920	1722920	You know the cognitive importance of emotion is that notion that of no no but emotions are passions.
1722920	1729920	They we undergo them and they are losses of agency and they overwhelm us and an emotion is a passion.
1729920	1731920	It's the opposite of an action.
1731920	1740920	And it sounds to me like what there's a there is this platonic point right where people oh they realize no no no emotion affords agency.
1740920	1744920	It's not robbing me of choice and agency.
1744920	1746920	Am I hearing that well.
1746920	1747920	Yes.
1747920	1748920	Yes you are hearing that very well.
1748920	1749920	Yes.
1749920	1750920	Yes.
1750920	1757920	And certainly there are cases where certainly there are cases where the learning around emotion has been one where.
1757920	1762920	Yeah the impulse the impulse becomes scary because it may overwhelm action and all these sorts of things.
1762920	1765920	There is that side of this as well.
1765920	1771920	But but often I think that the move here is that that this damage if we call it that happens so early in life.
1771920	1784920	It's it's an attachment relationship rupture of some kind which leads to which leads to all these defensive structures coming online which then leads to a lifetime of just having this distance from our emotions.
1784920	1796920	So the way that we are understanding what an emotional emotional experience might or might not be like is completely removed from the truth of what it could be like because we've already got the defensive structures in place.
1796920	1798920	And.
1798920	1801920	And so.
1801920	1805920	So in terms OK so in terms of pain.
1805920	1811920	One way of thinking about chronic pain here that relates to this point is that.
1811920	1824920	Pain the pain that if the pain is being driven if the pain is being driven by an inability for a person to consciously experience the emotion of guilt.
1824920	1830920	Let's say because a lot of this is just about anger which gets a lot of air time and kind of the space where I am.
1830920	1834920	But it's about the guilt the child then has about noticing the anger.
1835920	1840920	That's actually the more the more difficult emotion for a child to bear and for anyone to bear.
1840920	1844920	It's very difficult emotion very painful painful.
1844920	1855920	And so rather than learning to experience so rather than having that they experience pain which defends them from the emotional experience of guilt but it also helps to serve the guilt.
1855920	1858920	It's it's a way of saying I'm a bad person.
1858920	1860920	I should suffer.
1860920	1866920	It's actually this is what I mean by the wisdom of emotions once you can get clear with a person that an emotion is not there for no reason.
1866920	1867920	What's its story.
1867920	1868920	What's it trying to do.
1868920	1873920	What's its associated impulse for guilt the impulse is to reach out and repair.
1873920	1874920	Right.
1874920	1875920	I want to reach out.
1875920	1877920	I want and guilt is about a specific action.
1877920	1878920	It's not the shame.
1878920	1879920	Right.
1879920	1881920	Which usually operates as self attack.
1881920	1884920	It's just another way of turning anger in on oneself.
1884920	1886920	It's you know it's to reach out and repair.
1886920	1888920	It's there for a very important biological reason.
1888920	1892920	It's there to facilitate relationship not to destroy it.
1892920	1893920	But instead.
1893920	1894920	Yeah.
1894920	1911920	So instead for various reasons because people have never had an experience of being able to tolerate internally guilt, anger, grief, emotional pain because it happens so early in life and because it's in the context of an attachment relationship that they are so biologically driven to just hold on to it all costs.
1911920	1912920	Right.
1913920	1914920	Yeah.
1914920	1915920	Yeah.
1915920	1916920	As evolutionary provenance.
1916920	1918920	I mean, you don't have an attachment figure.
1918920	1919920	You're dead.
1919920	1920920	You're dead.
1920920	1921920	Yeah.
1921920	1922920	Absolutely.
1922920	1923920	So it makes sense at that time.
1923920	1927920	But what happens is this model then carries forward for the rest of our lives where it no longer makes sense.
1927920	1928920	It's outdated.
1928920	1930920	But we're not even aware of the model.
1930920	1931920	We're not even aware of the frame.
1931920	1933920	It's all unconscious.
1933920	1942920	So does this does your does your modality talk to attachment theory like or does it talk to EFT things like that as well?
1942920	1945920	Yeah, it's it's grounded in attachment theory.
1945920	1952920	So again, I mean, if it becomes relevant, you might explicitly speak to the patient about it, but it's all experiential.
1952920	1953920	But yes.
1953920	1954920	So what happens?
1954920	1961920	So what happens broadly speaking in ISTDP is through first of all, lots of groundwork.
1961920	1968920	Starting to notice emotions inside the patient starts to notice emotions inside themselves and we can get clear about what those are.
1968920	1972920	And if we don't pay attention to the pain and we look underneath, what are you feeling?
1972920	1976920	And so when they're looking underneath the pain, they get clearer on the emotions.
1976920	1989920	And then we facilitate them having in a full internal emotional experience, which means that they have a full set of sensations in their body, which are quite reliably consistent.
1989920	1994920	So for example, anger and rage is usually a heat that sort of starts and the belly radiates upwards.
1994920	1996920	It can go out the hands, the arms.
1996920	2002920	People feel it all of a sudden once all these resistances are out of the way, they can feel it and experience it in their body.
2002920	2004920	And then with that, and what would it want to do?
2004920	2006920	So we're trying to get to the impulse.
2006920	2008920	What does it want to do?
2008920	2010920	What does it want you to do this feeling?
2010920	2015920	And so it's this imaginal walking through of the impulse.
2015920	2026920	They can get to a point where they can describe in detail what the anger would want to do to their partner who, I don't know, didn't put away the washing yesterday or whatever it was.
2026920	2033920	And some of this is getting out of the way of rationality because what happens is they step in then to cut it off and say, but that makes no sense.
2033920	2036920	I shouldn't have raged towards someone for not putting away washing.
2036920	2037920	I can't have that feeling.
2037920	2043920	So we try and put all that to one side and say, maybe the emotion will show us why it's here and why it's so intense.
2043920	2047920	So they had the full experience.
2047920	2050920	They talk through the impulse.
2050920	2054920	Sometimes the impulse is to the point where the person is dead quite often.
2055920	2062920	And then through then seeing that, then they can often experience the guilt that's trapped underneath that to see this, you know, imaginal sort of dead figure.
2062920	2064920	All the feelings come up, the waves of grief.
2064920	2067920	You know, this is done over a standard period of time for some people.
2067920	2071920	For some people, you can do it sort of in one big go.
2071920	2072920	They have all of this.
2072920	2082920	And then often what happens, John, is that through this, they actually see in that, in that imaginal portrait, they see all of a sudden, oh, it's not my husband.
2082920	2083920	It's my mother.
2083920	2084920	It's my father.
2084920	2088920	Like they see the transfer of the like they see the other person who it relates to.
2088920	2092920	And then they have a memory come to them spontaneously, right?
2092920	2099920	And this is some event in their childhood that they have forgotten about or they sort of remember, but haven't really remembered.
2099920	2101920	And now it just comes to them vividly.
2101920	2103920	So I'll give you an example.
2103920	2109920	So, you know, a guy that comes in and say he's presenting complainers that he has crushing pain in his wrists.
2109920	2115920	And, you know, he sort of had issues with pain all his life and he's had this a bit all his life, but it's become really bad recently.
2115920	2118920	And he doesn't know why doctors can't help them.
2118920	2121920	It's so bad that he's he's had a child recently.
2121920	2123920	He's had a daughter and he can't even hold her.
2123920	2124920	Right.
2124920	2137920	And so, you know, through this work, we might come to find that the crushing pain in his wrists is a cover for what has happened as he picks as he becomes a father and starts to pick up his infant daughter.
2137920	2140920	She starts to reach out and touch his face, right?
2140920	2142920	And everyone says, oh, how lovely.
2142920	2143920	This is so wonderful.
2143920	2149920	Look, you know, and at the same time as crushing pain has come online and he can't pick her up anymore.
2149920	2165920	So what we what we come to find through this extended sort of form of therapy and doing this imaginal walking through of the emotions is that actually when he was younger, his mother would get in his face and hold him by the chest, right?
2165920	2167920	And scream at him, right?
2167920	2171920	Like the baby crying, scream at him and be dysregulated in front of him.
2171920	2175920	And he was terrified, terribly couldn't move.
2175920	2176920	And this is his mother.
2176920	2187920	But when we draw down into it, he had an intense rage towards his mother at that moment, which wanted to reach out, grab her wrists and crush them, crush them so that they would let go.
2187920	2188920	Right.
2188920	2190920	But he never experienced that.
2190920	2193920	He could never tell me that before we met and went through therapy.
2194920	2205920	And so he comes to realize that, oh, this crushing pain that I feel in my wrists has been activated by my baby daughter reaching out and touching my face, which a part of me has intense rage about.
2205920	2210920	But I would never notice that because it's my baby daughter and I love her more than anything and I'm supposed to protect her.
2210920	2217920	So he protects her by feeling crushing pain in his wrists, which is both a rerouting of the impulse, but also works.
2217920	2218920	This is a relational thing.
2218920	2222920	Also works to make him unable to pick her up.
2222920	2228920	So now, even if the impulse ever got out, it can't get out because I'm impotent and I don't even pick her up.
2228920	2236920	So now he protects her in a second way with a second layer by now he's in a situation where he will never be in the situation where she'll be holding his cheeks.
2236920	2239920	But he knows none of this consciously at the start.
2239920	2247920	So there's this whole sort of understanding about how this is working in relationship that is really fundamental here.
2247920	2251920	And I'm aware that I've probably gone wildly off track to your original question.
2252920	2253920	No, no, that was very helpful.
2253920	2257920	I mean, we can leave the original question aside if we need to.
2257920	2261920	I thought what you did was actually more to the point.
2261920	2266920	I do want to give Terri a chance to get involved now.
2266920	2279920	She's always very gracious and she lets me sort of do this for a bit and open things up and make connections, which I appreciate because often she's introducing me to people.
2279920	2283920	But I think it's I think it's a good time now to turn things back to Terri.
2283920	2285920	Thanks, John. Thanks for seeing.
2285920	2289920	Now, I just really enjoy especially this time enjoying the conversation.
2289920	2305920	I can certainly see so much of it in the things that we've talked about before and, you know, especially in relation to our thinking of this socialization of pain and how our narrative bias is driving a lot of this.
2305920	2321920	So, you know, the narrative bias coming from the early childhood experiences and that providing the bias to what we are thinking and giving us a filter of how we are then relating to these things as we go forward in life.
2321920	2331920	One of the things I wanted to ask you as the chair is about when you are in these moments with someone in therapy, I know you've spoken about being in the flow state with them before.
2331920	2344920	And I'm really interested about how you enter into the flow state because to me it sounds like you're cultivating an environment, an emotional environment where you're allowing insight to come forward.
2344920	2349920	And that's again goes to John's point where you're saying like what happens after you leave the session.
2349920	2354920	Well, now they've got some wisdom that they've gone away with and they carry that with them going forward.
2354920	2365920	So what it appears to me is that you're cultivating this ability to have emotional insight in the moment and you are creating that experience between you.
2365920	2372920	So it must be a very special feeling to be in from both sides as the therapist and as the patient.
2372920	2377920	But what does that bring up for you?
2377920	2389920	Yeah, there's a, I think this is the word I've used with you before Terry, there's a sort of an embeddedness that that's what it feels like to me when you when I'm really with a patient.
2389920	2397920	And what facilitates that I think is just really focusing in on the relationship, the one on one relationship.
2397920	2401920	And obviously, you know, even for the therapist, that can be very confronting too.
2401920	2408920	So, you know, there's being aware of all your own stuff as well.
2408920	2418920	So the way I think about it is there's sort of lots of theory and lots of thinking outside of session and then you come to session and I try to just let all that fall away, which is in itself anxiety provoking,
2418920	2421920	and feel sometimes like I have no idea what I'm doing or where we're going.
2421920	2433920	But it's just keeping the relationship front and center and the question in my mind really that guides that is how close can I get to this person how close will they let me get to them and how closely can I connect to them.
2433920	2436920	How vulnerable can we can we be here emotionally.
2436920	2445920	So the work of that really the groundwork of that is which can take a very long time is trying to to bring down the defensive structures.
2446920	2453920	So, so getting clear on what are the defenses that are getting in the way of us emotionally connecting, pointing those out.
2453920	2459920	And then there is often a real battle inside the patient about what they're going to do about that because they've got two parts in operation at once.
2459920	2474920	So once the part of them, and this is I think fundamental with ISDDP, the idea that there is always a healthy part, we call it that there is always like an unconscious part inside a person that is striving for this emotional liberation.
2474920	2478920	And this opening up right that is a fundamental tenant of it.
2478920	2485920	So we so some of this is about trusting that part to help guide us as the clinician.
2485920	2493920	But that is the part we're trying to get in contact with and trying to try and we are using sort of metaphor and other forms of language to speak to that part as well.
2494920	2503920	So once once that part rises up against the part that says no way we never we never let someone get that close to us, especially not another woman.
2503920	2507920	You know, like last time I did that it was disastrous women never get that close to me.
2507920	2511920	This part is going to try very once this part can finally break free.
2511920	2518920	That is when the defenses go down and that is when the person has more ready access to their emotions and they just become spontaneous with it.
2518920	2523920	There's no more resistance. That is when this flow state I would say is occurring.
2523920	2529920	It's when you can see it, you get the sense in their eyes almost.
2529920	2533920	And so but it calls for me to also connect in the same way.
2533920	2537920	So I need to get to my emotional landscape and that can be fronting too.
2537920	2539920	But everything else falls away.
2539920	2542920	Like there are I mean, it's not just me.
2542920	2545920	I mean other therapists who have been using this model far longer than me.
2545920	2549920	You know, talk about the ways in which even their perception changes.
2549920	2553920	They, you know, the way that they see color might change.
2553920	2558920	They might, you know, there's a there's a change to to the state of mind.
2558920	2562920	There's just a change in in the moment.
2562920	2564920	It feels very different and you're just with the person.
2564920	2574920	And when I when I am like that, which is not, you know, not all the time, probably very infrequent to be honest, but at its best things come to me as well.
2574920	2581920	Like I find myself sort of, you know, saying things and they just somehow are the right thing to say that it's helping to bring up whatever needs to come up.
2581920	2588920	So there is a letting go and a trusting of an unconscious component here, which is part of the model.
2588920	2594920	And that relates directly, though, to the way that the emotion is understood as actually being kind of this.
2594920	2600920	It walks between the unconscious and conscious, I guess answers your question.
2600920	2608920	No, no, it's really interesting. So as you know, in the work that I did with the practice, two different practitioners were together.
2608920	2615920	Many of the practitioners talked about it being transformational for them to actually be part of that environment.
2615920	2629920	And I think you've spoken a lot to that, even though you're the practitioner on your own in that session, which is probably taking on all the burden, because I know that you're a very holistic practitioner and you're looking at the whole senses of the person in that room at that time.
2629920	2636920	Can you just a little bit more about the language? You mentioned metaphor and thing that you bring to the table.
2636920	2648920	But one of the things we've been talking about with John is about how the practitioners also need to have a common language that they can use that we can get to this point with people.
2648920	2651920	So we can help them to understand what's going on.
2651920	2657920	Part of the problem is that we don't have a common language between practitioners and people who need the help.
2657920	2665920	So how are you working with that? I know you sort of said and alluded to the types of people that are coming to you.
2665920	2670920	I'm assuming they're all coming to you a free choice as well. So that's a thing.
2670920	2682920	But yeah, obviously you've probably done quite a lot of work on this in the past to actually decide what kind of language you'll use and how that works for you.
2682920	2691920	That's a really, really important point. I mean, I think even the word unconscious is really off-putting for many people.
2691920	2697920	So, you know, I think using something like hidden or trapped or can be useful.
2697920	2707920	So just talking about the idea that, you know, it's quite common when it comes to depression or anxiety or chronic pain of the nature that you're describing,
2708920	2715920	that it is a signal. It's a signal that our brain is giving us to protect us from something else that's happening under the surface.
2715920	2723920	And, you know, the idea that, you know, under the surface there may be hidden elements or sort of trapped elements under there.
2723920	2726920	And usually these are emotional in nature.
2726920	2730920	So that would be the way that I probably talk about it.
2730920	2739920	And if we can get to that sort of the engine, if that's the thing that's driving the need for these other symptoms to be here,
2739920	2744920	because they're firing to try and keep us distant from what's happening under the surface,
2744920	2753920	then if we can maybe bring this up and out and look at it, you know, you and I together over time very carefully at a rate that you're comfortable with,
2753920	2760920	you can just see what's there and see if we can put all our assumptions aside and try and make, you know, have a look at what it shows us.
2760920	2770920	That might help your brain to see that it doesn't need to be doing all this on the top anymore and this actually can fall away.
2770920	2779920	So the anxiety and the depressive symptoms and the chronic pain that you're experiencing may no longer be needed because you've brought this scary thing,
2779920	2782920	the thing that your brain has decided is very scary and you should never look at it.
2782920	2791920	You've brought it up and out into the light and hopefully in doing that we might see that not only is it okay, not so scary,
2791920	2797920	but also that it might tell you something really important that helps to clear up your vision.
2797920	2803920	It helps you to understand yourself and how you are in relationships so much more clearly.
2803920	2810920	And that is usually the link for people, Terri, that's really helpful because people often present with, I don't have confidence, you know,
2810920	2816920	I'm paralyzed at making a decision, lots of self-doubt, you know, I want to feel confident.
2816920	2824920	Well, the confidence comes from this agency piece we were talking about that actually access to these things that are trapped under here
2824920	2831920	might be the thing that gives you more information that allows you to see more clearly and therefore it feels easier for you to make decisions.
2831920	2838920	It seems clearer to you about your desire and your preference and that you can act in the world with that.
2838920	2840920	Is that what you meant by language?
2840920	2847920	Yes, yes, because I've certainly found in all the stories and the people I've spoken to when it comes to persistent pain,
2847920	2853920	so, you know, pain of different, so emotional and physical pain continuing for a long time,
2853920	2859920	then quite often it's been a case of there being guilt and shame sitting underneath that.
2859920	2862920	But that's the last thing people want to talk about.
2862920	2871920	It's very, very difficult to get to that place of being in that vulnerable position to actually talk, because we just don't have,
2871920	2880920	we don't have a natural place to start from to talk about things like, like I said, anger is something that we do know how to talk about
2880920	2882920	because we talk about the actions of anger.
2883920	2888920	We don't really have a way of talking about guilt and shame in the same way,
2888920	2893920	but we have an awful lot of narrative bias that are held by guilt and shame,
2893920	2898920	that, yeah, we just don't find a way to talk about it in the same way.
2898920	2905920	What are the actions? What are the things? How is it feeling in us when we have these emotions?
2905920	2906920	Yes.
2906920	2908920	Could I say something?
2908920	2911920	I just want to pick up on the language theme if that's okay.
2911920	2912920	Is that all right?
2912920	2921920	Because I want to take it a little bit further, because I want to talk about not only language in therapy, but between therapies
2921920	2928920	and what I mean by that, and because this is also an aspect that I heard in Terry's question.
2928920	2930920	Maybe that's not what her intent was, but I was.
2930920	2941920	So for example, let's have somebody who's coming to you because there's good reason to believe that the issues that you describe are taking place in them.
2941920	2949920	But they also actually literally have like some damage, muscular damage, and they're needing to do physio and things like that.
2949920	2959920	And what's interesting is some of the language you were using around the imaginal and the, you know, how things are metaphorical and embedded.
2959920	2967920	I mean, if you take a look at Nick Winkleman's work on the language of coaching, and he talks about you have to give people an active metaphor
2967920	2970920	so they inhabit their body in different ways.
2970920	2978920	And they learn through these imaginal practices how to move in a different way, and that feeds back into a different sense of agency.
2978920	2987920	And part of what I heard in Terry's question, and I'm not attributing anything to Terry, but Terry and I do talk about this is like,
2987920	2993920	but what kind of language could we use that would help you and the physiotherapists?
2993920	3003920	It's not instead of talking past each other or politely disliking each other or the kind of thing that might happen because that you come from very different worlds.
3003920	3010920	You're talking about an inner world and the unconscious, and presumably they're coming from a very physiological, mechanically oriented world.
3010920	3016920	And if we just use those two languages, you're not going to talk to each other and the patient's going to then, right?
3016920	3023920	But if we say, well, wait, wait, wait, there's this imaginal, there's an active metaphor, there's the way the body can symbolize things,
3023920	3034920	and there's a way we can get that to open up and between us, and you use language from, you know, you used one of the four E's, it's embedded, and it's dynamical.
3034920	3043920	I'm interested in that, I'm interested in, so this is not language you'd be using maybe right in therapy,
3043920	3050920	although you might use it in front of the patient when you and another therapist are talking together.
3050920	3056920	And Terry, does that land for you as also a dimension of the language issue?
3056920	3065920	Yes, yes, definitely. I wondered if maybe we extend that as Bezier, have you had experience working with another practitioner in the room?
3065920	3066920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3066920	3071920	That would be really interesting how you reflect on language that you use.
3071920	3082920	Not with ISTDP. I have worked with other clinicians before, definitely using other forms of therapy, and probably more helpfully.
3082920	3093920	I mean, I've worked on lots of research projects that look at team practice and look at sort of innovative ways to respond to clinical complexity,
3093920	3099920	and some of that has exposed me to some of these ideas and thinking about how this might work in practice.
3100920	3114920	If I had another, so if I had someone like a physio in the room, and we're trying to work together, I think this does relate to how I might talk to a patient anyway, to be fair.
3114920	3116920	Okay, I didn't want to pin you down though.
3116920	3117920	No, that's okay.
3118920	3125920	It's not, it's not choosing one over the other. Both are true. It's really, you know, both are true.
3125920	3134920	There is a component here that is that working on the physical body is likely to give you some kind of relief.
3134920	3135920	Yes.
3135920	3139920	And there is, you know, that working on the emotional, I just call it the emotional landscape.
3139920	3146920	I don't even use any of this psychological or just working on your emotional landscape will provide some relief.
3146920	3150920	And wouldn't it be amazing if both things could happen at tandem so you could have maximum relief?
3150920	3159920	Like if the idea is that this is a cycle and one is informing the other, you know, they are ultimately, you can't separate them.
3160920	3169920	And so if we can both be, you know, working on one part of it, then hopefully together that provides maximum relief.
3169920	3175920	I don't see it as a choice between one or the other. Both are true.
3175920	3178920	Both are just different ways of looking at the same thing.
3178920	3182920	And I don't think that, I mean, this gets a bit more broad, I guess.
3182920	3191920	But my thinking is I don't think that there is one ideal way that any human being could address the entirety of something.
3191920	3195920	I just think we have limited view by nature of who we are.
3195920	3202920	And so we can work on that and how wonderful to have multiple people working from different viewpoints together.
3202920	3211920	So I would just talk about it as, you know, let's consider the idea that emotions are having a role here
3211920	3214920	and they're having a very real impact on the body.
3214920	3221920	And so I don't know anything about, you know, what might be relieving to the muscles and whatever that you do.
3221920	3229920	And I might have some role here in being able to speak to why it is that this is even happening in the first place.
3229920	3236920	You know, that doesn't mean that the physical correlates aren't there and that working on them can have some relief.
3236920	3246920	But if there's an engine underneath driving that, that's about self-punishment, for example, then fixing this is just going to lead to that engine
3246920	3249920	manifesting somewhere else in this person's life.
3249920	3257920	But just to take it further, I mean, you could, given the example you had with the wrist and being held, you could, you know,
3257920	3264920	the therapist could present the movement that's needed to do the damage and connect it to that metaphor and say,
3264920	3270920	when you're doing this to, but think about that, think about, like, getting release and being free from that.
3270920	3273920	Or, you know, to see what it is.
3273920	3275920	Yeah, yeah.
3275920	3281920	But by giving them a bridging metaphor that bridges between the two therapies in an important way.
3281920	3285920	Yes.
3285920	3289920	Yeah.
3289920	3295920	See, these are the questions Terry and I are really, I mean, we're interested in everything you're saying.
3295920	3297920	But I'm also, we're interested in this.
3297920	3299920	We're interested in what could we do.
3299920	3303920	I mean, you're coming at this very wholeheartedly and that's very appreciative.
3303920	3306920	But, you know, some people will come in more hesitantly.
3306920	3312920	And if we could say, right, you know, well, there's a way in which you, you two could co-create a shared language.
3312920	3319920	And if we play around like we're doing right here, we might start to uncover some shared language that we could both use.
3319920	3325920	And we could get the two therapies to work in concert rather than orthogonal to each other.
3325920	3326920	Yeah, no, I love that.
3326920	3327920	I like the language.
3327920	3329920	I like the language of opening up.
3329920	3335920	So I think as opposed to release, I have among the on the fence about the word release.
3335920	3338920	I think that actually freaks some people out and that's part of the problem.
3338920	3340920	They think the impulse is going to be released out of them.
3340920	3343920	That's why they, that's part of the defense, why the structure is there.
3343920	3345920	But that would be, that's exactly it.
3345920	3348920	You could say to the physiotherapist, say, don't use release language.
3348920	3349920	That's the wrong metaphor.
3349920	3352920	Try to use opening up language.
3352920	3355920	Creating more space inside.
3355920	3356920	And you can still do that.
3356920	3357920	You do that with your physical body.
3357920	3361920	Like I think about, you know, I used acceptance and commitment therapy for a long time.
3361920	3366920	And the way that you would deal with difficult emotions there is to imagine more space inside around the emotion.
3366920	3367920	Right.
3367920	3369920	It's an open up, but it's still inside you.
3369920	3372920	It's not about, I need to throw it out into the world because I can't have it.
3372920	3378920	Because it's important that it's, you see it in reality as being part of the inner landscape.
3378920	3383920	It doesn't need to go into relationship or it doesn't, doesn't need to be enacted the impulse.
3383920	3384920	So, so opening up is nice.
3384920	3390920	So you could talk about while they're doing the exercises, you know, can you feel how that, how that is opening you up?
3390920	3393920	Can you feel how that is opening up the emotion?
3393920	3401920	You know, it might also be opening you up to be able to see and recognize this anger and more and more detail as you do these exercises.
3401920	3404920	I would talk about opening up as opposed to release.
3404920	3410920	It's teaching the person that they can, that they have space and room inside to bear an emotion in a sort of graded way.
3410920	3412920	But also opening up as metaphorical.
3412920	3414920	Opening up means so many things.
3414920	3415920	Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
3415920	3416920	That's it.
3416920	3421920	That possibility opening up, you know, a relationship of your life, your movement in the world and your action.
3421920	3423920	So I think opening up is how I talk.
3423920	3424920	That's how I talk about it.
3424920	3425920	Yeah.
3425920	3428920	I just, I just say that release is a very negative thing.
3428920	3434920	So we release our anger and it's like quite often the thing we're trying to stop and hold back from.
3434920	3437920	So that if you say you're trying to, you know, you're going to release something.
3437920	3440920	It's like, maybe I need to hold that back, not do it.
3440920	3442920	You know, so it's kind of.
3442920	3443920	Yeah.
3443920	3444920	If it's an aggressive, yeah.
3444920	3445920	Yeah.
3445920	3447920	If you're talking about the aggressive impulse that comes with it.
3447920	3448920	Yes.
3448920	3453920	But there is, there is a way to that with this work, you come to see that anger can be really useful, helps people to be assertive.
3453920	3456920	The people that are passive and never take action.
3456920	3457920	You can integrate the anger.
3457920	3462920	And so now anger makes me realize I don't like what this person's doing, but I also love them.
3462920	3464920	How can I tell them in a loving way?
3464920	3465920	Really don't like what you're doing.
3465920	3466920	It's, it's hurting me.
3466920	3468920	It's impacting the relationship.
3468920	3472920	Oh, that can help us to connect more and actually make our relationship better.
3472920	3476920	Anger can help me if I bring it in in the right way to make the relationship better.
3476920	3478920	So, um, so, but you're right.
3478920	3483920	This, this idea that I think people can fight anger with aggressive impulse.
3483920	3487920	And so the idea that you're releasing exactly right, that would people would not want to.
3487920	3493920	Or it also insinuates that anger is like a poison that should never, you should never have and you need to release it.
3493920	3494920	That's.
3494920	3496920	And there's other, there's other potential connections.
3496920	3501920	You talked a lot about sort of seeing in a new way and even inhabiting your body in a new way.
3501920	3507920	And a lot of reason why people are like, they have trouble in physio is because of exactly that.
3507920	3510920	They're not inhabiting their body in the right way.
3510920	3515920	And if you could get people to say, Oh, like in both these places, I'm not inhabiting my body in the right way.
3515920	3517920	And you could get those to talk to each other.
3517920	3522920	You see, this is what, this is what I'm trying to get at this, this kind of right.
3522920	3527920	And what Terry's got some research showing that if the patient is watching you and the other therapists,
3527920	3532920	like co-create this language, especially in a way that's accessible to them,
3532920	3536920	that has extra, that has extra therapeutic benefit to it.
3536920	3538920	Well, they're watching integration happen.
3538920	3539920	So that's right.
3539920	3540920	Yeah.
3540920	3541920	Yeah.
3541920	3544920	They are witnessing their inter-psychic play out.
3544920	3545920	That's great.
3545920	3547920	Yeah, I don't need to say it anymore.
3547920	3549920	Look, look, others are saying it too.
3549920	3550920	Yes, yes.
3550920	3554920	So therapy, John, we are trying to help facilitate them seeing that inside themselves.
3554920	3557920	So a step two, that might be to see it in front of them.
3557920	3561920	Oh, and these are also two people who, you know, hopefully know what they're talking about.
3561920	3565920	So I can't just look away and minimize and rationalize out of this.
3565920	3572920	And they happen and that, again, you know, even on unconscious level may start to help them to notice it inside themselves
3572920	3573920	and start to integrate inside themselves.
3573920	3576920	Modeling goes deeper in the brain than propositions.
3576920	3578920	Really, it really does.
3579920	3581920	And this also speaks to group therapy.
3581920	3587920	Like I've been thinking Terry too about, because I know you're thinking about sort of how are you going to take this and how can it be useful?
3587920	3592920	You know, there's a lot of these pain protocols that are being used are done in a group setting.
3592920	3600920	And I think it's a similar thing, you know, that being able to witness other people around you have their own wrestling match of this.
3600920	3611920	And for some people, helps to see that more clearly within themselves and maybe helps them to then be able to do that more clearly for themselves.
3611920	3614920	Right, but it's a need to see it externally.
3614920	3618920	Yes, I think hearing other people's stories is amazingly therapeutic.
3618920	3627920	It allows you to go see something in it that allows you to then to open up yourself and say, I'm not that unusual.
3627920	3632920	There is something, I have a connection with someone on something and I can actually say that loud.
3632920	3636920	And that actually helps you to actually then, you know, consider it yourself.
3636920	3637920	Absolutely Terry.
3637920	3643920	And I think for, you know, for people who are open in a particular way, that's true.
3643920	3651920	I think there are also people who are highly motivated to avoid some part of themselves to any degree and to hear a story that should otherwise do that.
3651920	3654920	For them, they'll find all sorts of ways to discount that story and dismiss it.
3655920	3656920	This is part of what happens.
3656920	3663920	The highly resistant patient is the one that, you know, something like ISTDP is really important for.
3663920	3671920	Whereas these sort of simpler forms that make up a pain protocol are going to be useful for another subset of people.
3671920	3673920	The shared language.
3673920	3677920	Yeah, the opening up the, yes, the inhabiting your body.
3677920	3685920	So it's true that for many people that intellectualize and isolate emotional experiences being something that's like a word that pops up in my brain.
3685920	3688920	They have no connection to what it feels like in their body.
3688920	3690920	And so that is the work.
3690920	3696920	The work is getting back into the body and they start to notice all these sensations in their body that they've never noticed before.
3696920	3705920	I taught Tai Chi Chuan for a couple of decades and getting people to inhabit their body is a very difficult thing to do.
3705920	3717920	And then people will often, if this is a big move for them, they'll often be the release of emotion associated with that, re-enhabiting their body.
3717920	3721920	That's why they don't want to be in their body because it helps them to avoid the emotions.
3721920	3723920	Exactly, exactly, exactly.
3723920	3726920	Yeah, yeah.
3726920	3727920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3727920	3733920	I mean, I would love to think about that shared language thing in some more depth.
3733920	3738920	Because that is, yeah, that is the practical takeaway here, isn't it?
3738920	3740920	That would be useful to what?
3740920	3741920	Well, at least one.
3741920	3745920	I mean, there's lots of practical people, but that's one, yeah, I would say.
3745920	3749920	I think it's just something that we are collectively discussing.
3749920	3762920	I think even just the action of discussing the need for a shared language is something that's, you know, really helping us go forward because it's a little bit more comes out each time we have these conversations, I think.
3763920	3770920	And I also think like the process of co-creating it in front of patient is valuable.
3770920	3776920	So I've been trying to do a thing where instead of like, this is in the scientific domain, but I think there's some analogy.
3776920	3785920	Instead of just presenting the pristine final project, I've tried to do things where I'm working with other people collaboratively and they're seeing the scientific process.
3785920	3787920	They're not just seeing the finished product.
3787920	3794920	And they take a much more participatory role in that because they get involved with the generation of it.
3794920	3799920	And they're not just pointing at the finished product.
3799920	3801920	They're actually embodying it, right?
3801920	3803920	They're almost imitating it.
3803920	3805920	Sounds like voice craft as well.
3805920	3809920	That's been actually being part of these sorts of conversations.
3809920	3810920	Yeah.
3810920	3811920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3811920	3813920	No, absolutely, absolutely.
3813920	3822920	I think to, I mean, I don't know if this will be useful or not, but in terms of that, the clinicians sort of talking together and what they're doing and what they're modeling.
3822920	3832920	If they, I mean, part of this work is getting comfortable with our own emotional landscape and actually being forthcoming about that sometimes at key junctures.
3832920	3842920	And I just don't know, it might be useful for them to at least be bringing some of that language in when they're talking in front of the patient about how they're feeling, you know, how they're feeling during this process.
3843920	3852920	Just to normalize it for one, I mean, I'd have to think more on exactly how, you know, that might be utilized.
3852920	3861920	But it would be strange if they were doing this in front of the patient with the goal of trying to model something and not be reflecting it all on their emotional experience, wouldn't it?
3861920	3862920	And just be up here.
3862920	3878920	Well, hopefully, like I say, if they were involved in the process and not into the usual cultural drama of presenting the pristine product, that might make them more open to, like, you know, a participatory relationship to it rather than I am.
3878920	3887920	Even to say, even to say to one another as they're doing it in front of the patient, you know, wow, as you point that out, I hadn't thought about that before and I feel anxious as a result, you know.
3887920	3889920	Yeah, for sure, you should on the table.
3889920	3898920	And, you know, but, you know, this is something we should look at and like to really do the wrestling with something in front of the patient as opposed to avoiding.
3898920	3899920	Yeah.
3899920	3900920	I agree.
3900920	3902920	I mean, that's what I meant by modeling, right?
3902920	3906920	They're going to be modeling yet, right, to the patient and not just.
3906920	3916920	And it's about, and it's about, it's also, you know, it models to the patient the idea of participating and trying rather, you know, because what we're often also held back in certain ways.
3916920	3921920	Because we, we carry around these, these, you know, sort of all or nothing mentalities.
3921920	3924920	You either succeed or you're a failure.
3924920	3929920	And that also impedes a lot of this kind of work we're trying to do with people.
3929920	3931920	At least I find that with some of my students.
3931920	3938920	They get, they get into this thing where they get very self-defeating, because if they can't give the perfect essay, then there's no point.
3938920	3942920	And I'm trying to say, the word essay actually means to try, right?
3942920	3944920	Like you're supposed to be trying here.
3944920	3945920	Right.
3945920	3946920	Right.
3946920	3950920	That probably had very punitive authority figures in their past.
3950920	3951920	Right.
3951920	3952920	Very much not.
3952920	3954920	And I, and ongoing.
3954920	3957920	It's, it's, yeah, there's very much, there's very much.
3957920	3958920	Yeah.
3958920	3959920	If I.
3959920	3965920	With an authority figure, the idea that you could express to them your anger or just pleasure or something that they're doing doesn't come into the equation.
3965920	3976920	And so just noticing that you might feel some dislike or anger or irritation towards the person who's asking you to write this essay and asking you to put yourself out on the chopping block for, you know, being marked and evaluated.
3976920	3979920	Natural to feel some anger towards that person.
3979920	3982920	But they probably don't even realize that they just noticed their self attack.
3982920	3983920	It gets turned inwards.
3983920	3984920	Now I give myself.
3984920	3994920	And it gets very twisted because that you can also find out indirectly that the parent is helping by trying to manage this problem.
3994920	3995920	Right.
3995920	3996920	And coming in and right.
3996920	3997920	And we can fix this.
3997920	4002920	And it's like, well, maybe that's not what you should be doing here.
4002920	4003920	Yeah.
4003920	4004920	Yeah.
4004920	4005920	Yeah.
4005920	4006920	Yeah.
4006920	4007920	Yeah.
4007920	4019920	And then you widen that out just to the local community around them and then to the wider experience that they're having with all the other, you know, metacrisis and things that we've got going on.
4019920	4023920	Then that is just all coming down on them at the same time.
4023920	4024920	Oh, yeah.
4024920	4025920	Yeah.
4025920	4026920	Yeah.
4026920	4027920	You know,
4027920	4028920	It's a prime example.
4028920	4029920	Oh, yeah.
4029920	4030920	It's already high as fever.
4030920	4031920	Right.
4031920	4032920	The bar is already so high.
4032920	4036920	Most of them have got there through their own perfectionistic tendencies and self punitive tendencies already.
4036920	4041920	And it's just, it's just, and, you know, what they have to do is continually be assessed.
4041920	4042920	Yeah.
4042920	4046920	And they're on Instagram seeing perfect lives that are.
4046920	4052920	And they know propositionally they're fraudulent, but that doesn't matter to other parts of the brain, right?
4052920	4053920	No.
4053920	4054920	No.
4054920	4058920	And then it has huge, it has huge effects on them.
4058920	4059920	Mm-hmm.
4059920	4060920	Anyways.
4060920	4062920	We'll talk a little about the presentation.
4062920	4063920	Yeah.
4063920	4064920	Yeah.
4064920	4065920	Yeah.
4065920	4066920	Yeah.
4066920	4069920	We're coming to the end of our time and I want to thank you.
4069920	4073920	I mean, that was just really, really.
4073920	4078920	Well, I think we modeled to some degree we were talking about it became very collaborative.
4078920	4082920	And of course, Terry, it's always wonderful to have you here.
4082920	4091920	I'll give you two ladies a brief minute or two to do any summative or cumulative or provocative final words that you want to leave people with.
4091920	4095920	Maybe, Terry, you first and then you, Appassia.
4095920	4096920	Yeah.
4096920	4098920	Well, I just really appreciate the conversation.
4098920	4102920	I think we've opened up a lot of avenues that still need a lot of exploration.
4102920	4105920	So I'm looking forward to those.
4105920	4118920	I think I'm really interested to talk further about this moment of the action impulse and when that happens because the work we've been doing is really about this one turning point.
4118920	4121920	And I think that we touched on it and I really want to go.
4121920	4124920	I think it might even need a whole nother session to go into this.
4124920	4126920	What happens at this one particular moment?
4126920	4129920	I'm really keen to continue that discussion.
4129920	4131920	But thank you both so much for this.
4131920	4133920	It's been great.
4133920	4134920	Thank you both.
4134920	4135920	Thank you both.
4135920	4144920	That really speaks this point that you're bringing up at the end, Terry, about the things most interested in following on about the impulse really speaks to the unconscious alliance.
4144920	4151920	I think that's alive here with us because that by chance happens to be the area that I am most most fascinated by right now.
4151920	4155920	And I'm actually yes, looking at that in all sorts of ways.
4155920	4156920	I agree with you.
4156920	4164920	I think that that is a pivotal a pivotal point in all of this and something that ISTDP has brought into the mix for me that I never.
4164920	4169920	I never had with any other form of therapy that I'm trained and I trained in lots of models.
4169920	4180920	And that is the part of the part of the ingredient list that is making this form of therapy so much more transformative in the work that I do anyway.
4180920	4191920	It's giving me access to do things in the room and for people to change in ways that I've never seen before in other forms of therapy that I've used.
4191920	4198920	And I see some of that I think is being, to me, the action impulse is sort of liminal.
4198920	4202920	It's like the point between the internal and the external.
4202920	4206920	It's the bit right before it comes out of us and becomes action.
4206920	4209920	And I think there's something really important about that.
4209920	4212920	So yes, this has been this has just been such a pleasure and a delight.
4212920	4219920	And I feel I feel that I've only really just scratched the surface of so many of the areas that I would love to to dive in.
4219920	4224920	I hope it's been useful to have a tendency to go in 30 different directions.
4224920	4226920	No, it was very great.
4226920	4227920	It's been great.
4227920	4228920	It's been wonderful.
4228920	4229920	Thank you.
4229920	4231920	Thank you so very much.
