1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Welcome back to Awakening from the Meaning Crisis.

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,720
Last time we took a look at the advent of the Scientific Revolution and we looked at

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,040
the work of Copernicus and how the important advent of a scientific description of reality

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:36,360
had with it the consequence that most of our sensory experience was questionable as

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,200
illusory in nature.

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Galileo also developed that idea of the math as the language of reality and used that with

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,800
the new experimental method, a method also born out of the idea that most of our cognition

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,800
is deceptive and biasing in nature and he used that to discover inertial motion and

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,200
that changed the notion of matter into something that exists and resists our will.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,640
But that had the effect of killing the universe and making it purposeless in nature.

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,440
And thus we become odd islands of meaning and purpose in a vast ocean of meaningless

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,960
material motion.

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,160
So all of that of course is going to have an impact on people's self-understanding,

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,560
their demeaning that they're using to make sense of their existence.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,360
And look what's happening here, that Aristotelian idea that the structure of your experience

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,600
and the structure of reality conform has been radically undermined and now you are trapped

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:59,360
within your own mind behind veils of illusion disconnected from the world.

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,960
And God has become progressively more and more a matter of will.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,880
There's an individual that takes all of this up and he does more than just think about

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
this or speak about it or write about it.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:23,120
He's one of those really titanic individuals who exemplifies the chaos and the anxiety of

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
his time.

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
This is Martin Luther.

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,560
He's definitely deeply influenced.

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
He's German.

26
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,680
He's deeply influenced by the Rhineland mystics.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,280
He's influenced by that growing tradition of the self as radically self-negating inner

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,760
conflict being at the core of spirituality.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,200
He's an Augustinian monk.

30
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:56,400
He's deeply influenced by Augustine's ideas of self-depravity and our inability to achieve

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,880
mystical union with God unaided.

32
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,160
And through Augustine, Luther of course is deeply immersed in and impressed with Paul's

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,720
ideas about our inner conflict and now that parallels a conflict within God between God's

34
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,840
love towards us and God's justice driven anger and wrath towards us.

35
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,680
And Martin Luther is very terrified of that wrath.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,800
He's very terrified of it.

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,080
And he has taken that notion through taller of mystical self-negation and it has become

38
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:43,760
radicalized because of the influence of Augustine and Paul and his own inner conflict.

39
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,560
So that the self-negation in Luther's psyche has become self-loathing.

40
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,400
He experiences the self as radically folded into itself, obsessed with itself in a completely

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,520
immorally self-centered fashion.

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:12,480
So the self is this radical self-feeding self-negating because as the self is unfolded and obsessed

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,480
with itself, it is simultaneously being cut off from God and cut off from reality.

44
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:29,880
So it is very much a self-destructive process and I really want you to hear that self-destructive

45
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,760
process that he sees as the essence of the self.

46
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,920
So this is Luther's interpretation of the biblical notion of pride and rebellion against

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:49,520
God that we are intrinsically self-obsessed in this self-aggrandizing self-destructive

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,480
fashion.

49
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,560
So try to think of moments in your life that will give some substance to what Luther is

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,520
saying.

51
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,360
You have discovered a pattern of behavior self-destructive.

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,280
For example, perhaps you keep dating the same kind of person and you keep going back to this

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,080
and it keeps turning out to be wrong for you, perhaps also wrong for the other person.

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,960
So you step back and you've talked to friends and you reflect it and you make a deliberate

55
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
conscious effort.

56
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,640
No, no, I'm not going to date this person, this kind of person anymore, I'm not going

57
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,640
to date that type of person.

58
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,880
I'm going to date this type of person and that will change things.

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,040
I'll break this pattern and you go in and you find somebody, they seem to be totally

60
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:44,200
different and you start dating them and then lo and behold, against your will, even though

61
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,440
it seems to be something that you willfully brought about, you find yourself caught in

62
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,520
the same destructive pattern again.

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,040
Of course Freud and Jung and the whole psychodynamic tradition, very much, part of the legacy of

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,400
Luther by the way, are going to make much of that fact that we keep repeating, even

65
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,160
in our conscious efforts to change our behavior, we keep repeating these self-destructive patterns.

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,760
So although I'm critical of Luther, there's a deep truth here in Luther, there is the

67
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:28,600
touching of the way in which our unconscious processes, our unconscious cognition can be

68
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,200
beset with these, we've talked about it, these parasitic processes that have a life of their

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,520
own and can consume us.

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,600
So Luther is convinced that he cannot do anything to save himself.

71
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,120
He takes Augustine's notion that the Neoplatonic mystical ascent is insufficient on its own

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,400
and has to be supplemented with the love of God through Christ.

73
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,560
He takes that and he radicalizes it in a very powerful way.

74
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,760
Because of his own personal wretchedness, he comes to the conclusion that there is nothing

75
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,440
he can do.

76
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,960
And that leads into a startling interpretation of Paul, an interpretation that is going to

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,160
put him at odds with the Catholic Church.

78
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:28,360
This is the interpretation that we are saved by faith alone, where faith becomes nothing

79
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:38,320
more than a complete acceptance of God's saving grace.

80
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,200
So let's unpack this very carefully because it's become so enmeshed in our way of thinking

81
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,240
and being.

82
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:58,600
The idea here is that faith is, notice what's happened, all that sense of participatory knowing,

83
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,280
the sense that we're participating in a process.

84
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,440
Remember the Israelite notion that we're participating in our cultural history, we're participating

85
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,960
in the creativity of God.

86
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,000
All of that is now gone.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,680
It's gone.

88
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,160
And your sense of what it's like to be you, your sense of self, is completely twisted

89
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
and illusory.

90
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,640
So all the perspectival knowing, all the participatory knowing is being eradicated.

91
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:32,000
It's being reduced down to the acceptance of a proposition.

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,960
And an acceptance that cannot in any way be based on evidence or argument.

93
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,320
Because that would be your mind participating in your salvation.

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,440
It has to be a radical, pure acceptance.

95
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:56,560
So the self-negation of the Rhineland mystics has come to fruition in Luther's ideas here.

96
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,840
Now what does that mean?

97
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,200
That means that what you radically, radically have to accept is there's absolutely nothing

98
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
you can do.

99
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:16,120
And even your affirmation of the proposition of the creed of Christianity is something

100
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,080
that has to be given to you.

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,760
And what does that mean from God's side of this equation?

102
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,920
It means that God's act of saving you is completely arbitrary.

103
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:37,920
There is, since there is nothing you do, there's no thought, word or deed that you perform

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,840
that in any way earns or has any causal effect upon God's behavior.

105
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,920
And I'm not over-representing this.

106
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,280
Look at the debate between Luther and Erasmus.

107
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,820
Erasmus tried to propose what he called synergy, that the human being and God were working

108
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,260
together in a participatory fashion for salvation, with God, of course, having the bulk of the

109
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
work.

110
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,260
And Luther rejects that utterly.

111
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,900
God's saving of an individual is completely arbitrary.

112
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,380
So God has become, remember what we talked about in Occam, that God's will supersedes

113
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,380
his reason.

114
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,820
God's reason is now not involved at all.

115
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,100
It is just an arbitrary act of will that saves us.

116
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,460
And we have to radically accept that arbitrariness.

117
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,580
Now think about what that means.

118
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,820
And there's a weird, there's an irony here.

119
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,420
There's an irony here, and it's almost a self-referential irony.

120
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:57,580
Because Luther is trying, and I think he's very sincere, but he's trying to rescue us

121
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:07,460
from the fact that we are obsessed with ourself in an idolatrous fashion, and that that obsession

122
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,300
is a source of deep suffering for us.

123
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:21,060
We know that that self-obsession cuts us off, separates us.

124
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,220
But the irony is, in his endeavors to deal with that, look at what Luther is teaching.

125
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,340
What is he putting into our cultural grammar?

126
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:41,340
That we are inherently worthless, and that our inner life is one of self-loathing.

127
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:52,460
And the only solution to that is arbitrary, unearned regard.

128
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,620
This is the cultural training for narcissism.

129
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:08,100
Narcissism is to be trapped, to be self-obsessed within self-loathing, and that what you want

130
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,340
to alleviate is unearned positive regard.

131
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:22,640
Not for any reason, not for anything you've done, completely amoral unearned positive

132
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
regard.

133
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,020
That's narcissism.

134
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,060
One of the deep ironies of Luther's revolution is that, and I think there says something

135
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,700
about what's going on at the time, one of the deep ironies is he actually lays the grammar

136
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,360
for cultural narcissism.

137
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:51,500
We are all being trained to experience ourselves as wretched, self-obsessed, and that the only

138
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,020
solution is unearned positive regard.

139
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:09,720
And so we can see the spirit of Luther in our obsession with Instagram, in our obsession

140
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,400
with Snapchat.

141
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,540
We constantly want unearned positive regard.

142
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,620
Now, there are other consequences of this radical change.

143
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:30,780
Of course, immediate consequences, Luther comes into conflict.

144
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,020
He protests against the Roman Catholic Church.

145
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,460
That's what Protestant comes from, because the Catholic Church has a different doctrine

146
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:51,060
of salvation, that it's one in which the human being still has a participatory role.

147
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:58,340
And because of that, the Church also thinks that it's cultural history.

148
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,700
Think about how this is still an Israelite notion.

149
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,180
The Church still thinks that its tradition matters for human salvation, that participating

150
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:12,980
in that tradition, the tradition, the cultural history of the Church, is also something that

151
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,140
is needed.

152
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,900
Now I'm not advocating for Catholicism here over Protestantism.

153
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:27,620
I'm trying to get you to understand what the two sides were standing for.

154
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,420
So Luther is attacking all of that.

155
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,660
He's attacking the authority of the Church.

156
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,140
He's attacking the authority of tradition.

157
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,380
So history and tradition and institution don't matter.

158
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,620
Why?

159
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,180
Because Luther is a child of his time.

160
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,180
He is trapped inside his own mind.

161
00:14:49,180 --> 00:15:00,380
He advocates that all that really matters in matters of faith are individual conscience.

162
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,460
And please remember what this word means.

163
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:08,580
It means knowing yourself, science, conscience, knowing yourself.

164
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,900
The one thing you know is yourself.

165
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,580
And so Luther refuses to recant.

166
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:25,540
He refuses to change his interpretation, to be in line with the Church, and he valorizes

167
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:34,340
individual conscience as the final authority over a person's spiritual life.

168
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
This lays the foundation.

169
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,020
So do you see what's happened here?

170
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,240
This withdrawal of meaning into the individual mind, isolated individual mind, is now being

171
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,940
appropriated as, well that must mean that the mind, the individual conscience, is the

172
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,940
final soul authority of what matters.

173
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,660
It's a radical idea.

174
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:02,460
Many other cultures find this a bizarre idea that we possess in the West.

175
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:08,900
And so of course there's a lot of discussion nowadays about individual responsibility, individual

176
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
authority.

177
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,820
We have, as Adorno talked about it, we have a cult of authenticity.

178
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:22,900
That being true to yourself, and this is Lutheran, being true to yourself is the ultimate authority

179
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,780
by which you should judge and evaluate your life.

180
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,340
Now notice what has happened.

181
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:39,900
The connection to reality, being true to reality, has been superseded by being true to yourself.

182
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:46,900
And that is also emerging with a cultural grammar that is training us in narcissism.

183
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:03,580
Now because of this, Luther was a monk, and yet he comes to the conclusion that the monasteries

184
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,860
should be shut down.

185
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,140
Why would he come to that conclusion?

186
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Well, the West, for a long time, had these paired institutions.

187
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,140
We had a knowledge institution that has already emerged and is being developed in the Middle

188
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,220
Ages, and this of course is the university, where it's supposed to get a universal education,

189
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:36,180
come to understand as much of reality, the universe as you can.

190
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:45,980
And that was paired to a place where you have to go through transformation in order to acquire

191
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,740
wisdom, and this is the monastery.

192
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:59,740
And so this is the idea here, that here you're seeking that self-transcendence.

193
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,460
This is the legacy of the Axial Revolution.

194
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,620
This of course is a response to the emergence of first Aristotelian science, and then the

195
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:18,620
new science of people like Bacon, Copernicus Galileo.

196
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,820
And the two are supposed to represent an important synthesis of how human beings are to make sense

197
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,500
of themselves and to find a meaningful life.

198
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:45,020
But this institution places a huge premium on self-transcendence, as we've seen.

199
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:53,180
And for Luther, this is the Grand Illusion, the idea that human beings are capable of

200
00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:03,300
self-transcendence is something he thinks is the greatest lie that our self tells us.

201
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:09,900
He sees that as the greatest instance of the sin of pride.

202
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:17,700
See if you lose the perspectival participatory sense of faith, if faith just becomes assertion

203
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:29,820
born out of radical acceptance, then the idea of this being even possible to you disappears.

204
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:39,060
And so what happens is that these institutions are being shut down.

205
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,380
Now that means the university now needs something else in order to take this knowledge and give

206
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,140
it existential transformative relevance to individual lives.

207
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:57,280
The university has to be attached to something else that transforms people's lives, gives

208
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,780
structure and purpose to their existence.

209
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,580
And of course, we know what that's going to be.

210
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,300
That's going to be the state.

211
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,540
And knowledge is not going to be linked so much to wisdom.

212
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:16,700
It's going to be linked to politics.

213
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:24,620
And of course, that is going to be supported by the new science, people like Bacon famously

214
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:34,220
arguing that knowledge is power, the forerunner of the work of Michel Foucault and others.

215
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:43,860
So we get the loss of all the psychotechnologies of wisdom, of cultural communities that are

216
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,380
committed to providing guidance and support to people who want to cultivate wisdom, of

217
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,860
a historical tradition that can relay to us the patterns of success and failures and

218
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,820
give us practices that we can use to test out and try for transformation.

219
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,100
All of that is being lost.

220
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,980
So you know where to go for information.

221
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:11,420
You know where to go for knowledge, but now today you do not know where to go for wisdom.

222
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:21,680
We have sapiential obsolescence of our knowledge.

223
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:31,220
And we have knowledge being inextricably bound to the machinery of the state and to politics,

224
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:39,660
such that it is becoming increasingly difficult right now for us as a culture to distinguish

225
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:49,980
politics from knowledge, from the willful assertion of things that we must simply accept

226
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:59,660
because of an arbitrary will wielding power.

227
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:08,540
So the Protestant Reformation is titanic.

228
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:16,300
It is really inappropriate if you're trying to understand the advent of the meaning crisis

229
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,260
to only look at the scientific revolution.

230
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,940
You must look at the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation together.

231
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,700
They are conjoined.

232
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:39,260
Now there are other important aspects of the Protestant Reformation that come to the fore.

233
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:45,140
Because of his attack on tradition and institution, Luther advocates what he calls the priesthood

234
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,580
of all believers.

235
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,860
There is nothing in between.

236
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:57,420
There is no mediator between you and God.

237
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,820
There is no church.

238
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,300
There is no priest.

239
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,740
There is nothing here.

240
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,420
There is just a direct personal relationship.

241
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:16,900
Again this idea of your own personal spirituality has its root here.

242
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,860
Because of this, Luther argues that for the priesthood of all believers, everybody has

243
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,060
an equal spiritual authority.

244
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,180
Because of course learning processes of growth and self-transformation, those are no longer

245
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,340
important criteria.

246
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,900
All that matters is the degree to which God has saved someone.

247
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,500
Now we've talked about some of the negative consequences of that, but a positive consequence

248
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:52,700
for that is that Luther argues for a complete form of democracy within the church.

249
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:59,460
Everything should be decided democratically because there should not be any significant

250
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,580
authority or hierarchical structure.

251
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,300
Because Luther is rejecting all of that.

252
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,340
This of course is why the Catholic Church is so resisting to him, why they are so inimical

253
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
to him.

254
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:20,780
This idea eradicated because it undermines the very structure and existence of the institution

255
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,900
of the Catholic Church.

256
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:29,180
Now Luther doesn't propose political democracy.

257
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,940
He only proposes democracy within the church, but nevertheless that is going to give people

258
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:41,060
in their day-to-day lives experience with democratic processes, democratic decision-making.

259
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,060
In fact, in the areas that they consider most important about their lives, they are going

260
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,380
to be acting democratically.

261
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:57,740
Now Luther thinks that there shouldn't be democracy in the world outside of the church,

262
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:05,620
and when the peasants revolt in Germany because they are being influenced by this idea of

263
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,420
the importance of the individual, individual conscience and authority, Luther does not

264
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,980
side with the peasants, he sides with the princes, he sides with established authority.

265
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,220
He has a two-worlds doctrine, there is a doctrine within the church and that is a world that

266
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,580
is, remember how God is divided, right?

267
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,980
That is the world of God's love and that is where we act democratically.

268
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,860
But outside the church we don't know who is saved and who is not saved, we will come back

269
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,860
to that point.

270
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,220
And because of that, that is the world under God's wrath, then that is the world that has

271
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:44,740
to be kept in check by political authority, wielding the sword of power.

272
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:59,140
Again, that is a dark aspect of Luther, but it also brings with it the beginning of an

273
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:05,780
idea of the separation of church and state, radical new idea.

274
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,580
And Luther of course is proposing it because he is proposing it that within the church,

275
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,940
under God's love, people should be treated one way and outside of the church, which is

276
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,020
under God's wrath, there should be a different way in which people are treated and politically

277
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,340
operate and the state should not interfere with the church.

278
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,660
So we get the beginnings of separation of church and state, which we take for granted,

279
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,740
but this is going to further drive the secularization of the culture, it's going to further drive

280
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:44,180
the secularization of the culture, because more and more people are experiencing that

281
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:56,420
sacred as something private, separate, secluded unto itself, separate from the state and politics

282
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:07,020
and of course also science and the university.

283
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:14,500
Now that not knowing who saved, of course, also brings with it terrific problems.

284
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,380
This was made into a classic argument, which has come under some criticism, but I think

285
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,540
the core insight is still a value by Max Weber.

286
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:34,940
The problem with Luther's model is there's nothing you can do to know that you're saved,

287
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,880
because there is nothing you can do to bring, you have no causal role, which means there's

288
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:45,820
no causal evidence, there's no evidence, how do you know if you're saved?

289
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,300
Because God chooses people arbitrarily.

290
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:58,020
So this provokes terrific anxiety, there's tremendous anxiety about whether or not you're

291
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
saved.

292
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,700
You have your own, and Luther gives you, there's this dramatic tension in Luther, he gives

293
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,140
you this double bind.

294
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,740
He tells you that what you ultimately have to rely on is your individual conscience,

295
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:24,740
but he tells you that that inner world is one of overwhelming self-deception.

296
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,260
And so what do you do with this anxiety?

297
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,980
Well, you can't do anything officially, but what you can do is you can work hard to make

298
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,220
your life good.

299
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,700
Because if you're succeeding in the world, especially socioeconomic success, that surely

300
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,860
is a sign that God has chosen you, that God loves you.

301
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,980
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to develop what becomes called the present work ethic.

302
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,340
Because my only way of knowing is this unofficial way, this relatively unconscious way of knowing

303
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,420
that I'm saved, is if I'm succeeding well, so I'm going to work hard to succeed.

304
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:15,900
And I'm not going to use my wealth in any way to promote myself.

305
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,100
I'm not going to do what would later be called conspicuous consumption, because that would

306
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,140
be a sign of pride.

307
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:30,060
So I work hard, and in order to avoid pride, I'm going to push the money, the wealth I

308
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,980
acquire back into my business.

309
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,220
I'm going to get the present work ethic.

310
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,500
And this is going to align so well with the emerging corporations.

311
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,340
We talked about the emerging ascendancy of the commercial class, and we get the advent

312
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,580
of capitalism.

313
00:29:49,580 --> 00:30:01,460
As Weber's book famously puts it, the present work ethic and the spirit of capitalism.

314
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:05,060
And this worry is a real worry.

315
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,380
This is what you watch happen.

316
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:15,020
And what's amazing is how Luther was surprised by this.

317
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:21,020
For a man who is in many ways brilliant, he translates the Bible into German, by the way.

318
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,820
He makes the Bible readable for everybody because of the priesthood of all believers.

319
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,500
And he's a brilliant translator.

320
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,700
Many people consider him as one of the foundational figures of modern German.

321
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:42,060
But he honestly thought that everybody would read the Bible the same way he did.

322
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:49,060
So he thought we'd gotten rid of the Pope, but there would be a unifying thing that would

323
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,260
hold Christianity together, which is the idea of the Bible.

324
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,980
So the Bible becomes very holy, and many people have said that what Protestants have is a

325
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,460
paper pope.

326
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,220
The Bible takes the role for them that the pope does for the Catholic world.

327
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,900
And of course, we are facing struggles right now in our culture because we don't quite

328
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:18,780
know what to do with this terrible and awesome book, The Bible.

329
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:27,580
What shocked Luther and shouldn't shock us is that Protestantism quickly fragments because

330
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:36,900
when you give people no authority other than their own individual conscience, when you

331
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:45,080
separate them from any claims upon them of tradition, any claims upon them of history

332
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:54,700
or institution, any claims upon them of knowledge, the idea that they will all agree is actually

333
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,540
a ridiculous idea.

334
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:05,640
And so what happens and continues to happen to this very day is the huge and ongoing and

335
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,480
accelerating fragmentation of Protestantism into denomination after denomination after

336
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,480
denomination.

337
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,040
You get what has been called in other quarters, but can be applied here, the narcissism of

338
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:26,960
small difference, right?

339
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,920
You have to find that piece of evidence that shows that you are unique, that shows that

340
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:42,720
of all of the damned masses, God has elected you, your uniqueness, your specialness, your

341
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,080
unearned unique specialness has to be guaranteed.

342
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,520
And the more I'm like these other people, the more that comes into question.

343
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,600
So not only am I driven by my own radicalized subjectivity in my interpretation, I'm also

344
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:05,680
hungry for a mark of specialness for me that will show that I am saved.

345
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,520
And so the narcissism and the fragmentation of Protestantism walk, march, in lock, step

346
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:21,720
together, mutually accelerating.

347
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,360
So notice what's happened.

348
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:35,040
Take a look, you're getting, God is withdrawing, God's withdrawing.

349
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:42,960
By the time of Luther, God has become very much this arbitrary will in a world that is

350
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,040
nothing but a battle of wills.

351
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:56,160
Think about how not that long after Luther, you have Shakespeare.

352
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:03,640
Luther is the great writer of German, Shakespeare is the great writer of English.

353
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:13,000
Notice how somebody who is plumbing the depths of the human psyche, Shakespeare, in a way

354
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,600
that of course has struck most of us as perennially profound, how absent God is from that world

355
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,720
of Shakespeare.

356
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:30,680
There's supernaturals there, there are the witches in Macbeth, there are ghosts in Hamlet,

357
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:41,560
but God is not ever present and the supernatural is absurd and arbitrary and largely an agent

358
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:52,880
of chaos and a destiny that thwarts people in their endeavors.

359
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:04,280
It's telling how much God has withdrawn into being an arbitrary, absurd supernatural agency

360
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,080
that largely thwarts and undermines human activities.

361
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:22,280
So the Protestant Reformation is fundamental to our grammar of how we understand ourselves

362
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,880
and the problem is even though many of us are children of the secularization that is

363
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,000
accelerated by the Protestant Reformation, we still carry that grammar around in our

364
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
head.

365
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,360
We have to work hard, we have to work very hard and if we don't work hard, it's going

366
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,400
to be revealed how worthless we are.

367
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,560
And that we hunger for that unearned positive regard.

368
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:06,720
We need to find that mark of our uniqueness that shows that we are chosen from the damned

369
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,880
and that we will not disappear into nothingness and meaninglessness, but instead we will be

370
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:20,320
adored for simply who we are.

371
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:30,640
Now, all of these factors, the scientific revolution, the advent of the beginnings of

372
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,360
capitalism, especially corporate capitalism, and the Protestant Reformation are all mutually

373
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,840
reinforcing each other, they're giving people tremendous anxiety.

374
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,760
So the scientific revolution is basically cutting you off from the world and the Protestant

375
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,920
Reformation is basically offending you from the mother church and tradition and history.

376
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Look, you have to bear it all.

377
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,640
You alone, by yourself, you have to bear it all while simultaneously being told you don't

378
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,680
have the resources or the capacity within you to do it.

379
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:22,320
There are nothing that has to bear it all.

380
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,280
You cut off from the world, you cut off from reality, behind illusion, there's a restless

381
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:38,000
battle of wills, you cut off from wisdom institutions with sapiential obsolescence.

382
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,440
So this is a time of a lot of existential dread.

383
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:53,960
You see the very thoughtful response of people like Pascal, who is now experiencing the cosmos

384
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,440
not as a cosmos.

385
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,460
Remember what cosmos means, a beautiful order that we can participate in and that will afford

386
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,960
our self-transcendence.

387
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,520
No, Pascal, who's a mathematical genius, he gets the new math, he looks out at the cosmos

388
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:17,240
and he says, those infinite spaces terrify me.

389
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,960
The cosmos is now cold and terrifying.

390
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,440
Its vastness is inhuman and crippling of the human spirit.

391
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:44,640
There's an individual who arises at the same time and wants to address this anxiety.

392
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,960
And we'll talk about the comparison between Pascal and this person.

393
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,880
This person's Rene Descartes.

394
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:01,000
Descartes wants to take this grammar of the scientific revolution about math as the marker

395
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,280
of reality and he wants to use it to come up with, on his own, like a good Protestant,

396
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,640
although he's Catholic, but on his own, from his own individual consciousness.

397
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,480
He wants to come up on his own, forget the history, forget the tradition.

398
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
This is Descartes.

399
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:28,840
I'm going to use the new math to come up with a solution to this emerging meaning crisis.

400
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,920
Descartes is a genius.

401
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:40,320
And what he does is he invents a new psychotechnology, one of the most powerful psychotechnologies,

402
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,960
a psychotechnology that has been so internalized into our culture and our cognition that it

403
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,460
is almost transparent to us.

404
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:54,540
We do not realize it is the lens by which we see and understand the world.

405
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,260
Descartes liked to sleep in.

406
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,400
It's probably led to his death because when he had to go to Sweden, they didn't let him

407
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,520
sleep in and he had to go out in the cold air and that's probably what led to his death.

408
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,280
So he liked to sleep in.

409
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,300
So one day he's laying in bed and it was the fashion at the time, the architectural fashion,

410
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,620
further to be tiling on the floor and tiling on the walls.

411
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,340
There's a fly flying around the room.

412
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,740
Now, for most of us, that's where we, that's, that's it.

413
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,860
That's all we get, fly in a room.

414
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,380
But Descartes notes that if he, he noted that if he counts the number of tiles along, right,

415
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,820
these three axes, he can come up with three numbers that will plot wherever the fly is

416
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,680
in the room.

417
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:55,320
Descartes invents Cartesian graphing, the system we use today, the XYZ system.

418
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:03,440
He takes the new algebra, the new way in which, right, the new way in which Galileo had been

419
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,600
using math and he pushes it even further.

420
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,620
He invents graphing.

421
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,660
And what, what psychotechnology, because that's what it is.

422
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,820
This is a standardized strategy.

423
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:25,460
Learn from your society, a socialized, standardized strategy for information processing.

424
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:34,700
What psychotechnology more means science to you than a graph.

425
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,000
When I can make a graph, I'm doing science.

426
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,680
When I can think graphically, I'm thinking scientifically.

427
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,520
This is one of the most powerful and pervasive psychotechnologies, and he invents it.

428
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,640
And this brings with it a powerful idea, because he invents analytic geometry.

429
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:09,500
Any geometrical shape can be converted into an algebraic equation.

430
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:21,260
Equations capture reality, because, remember what Galileo has done, math doesn't have to

431
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:27,860
look like, it doesn't have to share the same gestalt as what it's representing.

432
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,920
That has now been taken to its fulfillment in Descartes.

433
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:39,640
Equations are not in any way like what they represent, but nevertheless, following up

434
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:46,080
on Copernicus and Galileo, they are what cut through illusion into reality.

435
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,680
Now this is a radical idea.

436
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,200
Because of graphing and analytic geometry, we get this idea that we can grasp the world

437
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,320
with equations.

438
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:05,620
So you think that this captures something deep about the world, E equals MC squared,

439
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,780
and you should.

440
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,420
Because when you really understand this, you can take a paperclip worth of matter, and

441
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:24,340
you can smash a city to the ground, men and women, like gods.

442
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:32,200
It's intoxicating the power that it puts at our fingertips.

443
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:40,900
It seems to provide overwhelming evidence that this way of thinking puts us deeply in

444
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,980
touch with the fiber and fabric of reality.

445
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:52,280
We are fundamentally in contact, but it's not a contact of experience.

446
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,380
It's not the Aristotelian conformity.

447
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,700
It's not participatory.

448
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,900
It is purely propositional.

449
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,940
It is purely abstract.

450
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,220
It is purely symbolic.

451
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:19,020
Now that's going to bring with it a radical idea.

452
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:27,280
Descartes thinks, well you know what, this is how I can understand the meaning crisis.

453
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,360
All this anxiety, he didn't of course call it the meaning crisis, so that's anachronistic

454
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
on my part.

455
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,720
But I'm putting words into his mouth so that we can talk to him across space and time.

456
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,920
There's all this anxiety.

457
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,120
There's all this sense of disconnection.

458
00:44:42,120 --> 00:45:01,620
So Descartes understands the meaning crisis as a lack of a search for certainty.

459
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:10,860
Conformity in the Aristotelian, the Neoplatonic sense, participatory, perspectival conformity

460
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:18,360
has been replaced by propositional certainty.

461
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,960
And of course the thing about math for Descartes is it gives you certainty.

462
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,760
That's why math cuts through all the illusions.

463
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:39,480
That's why it allows us access to such power.

464
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:50,580
So Descartes thinks the answer to the crisis is to transform our minds, not in any kind

465
00:45:50,580 --> 00:46:00,060
of spiritual transformation, but to transform our minds into machines of certainty.

466
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:09,720
Equations that will only work mathematically and logically in terms of equations.

467
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:18,320
The way to get certainty is to turn myself into a machine that represents the world to

468
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:26,480
abstract symbolic propositions and then manipulate those propositions in a purely logical mathematical

469
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,680
function.

470
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:41,380
What Descartes is proposing is that the way to address the anxiety of the age is for each

471
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:49,020
one of us to adopt a method that will turn us into computers.

472
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,020
That's what a computer is.

473
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,040
Computer is originally a word applied to people, by the way.

474
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,200
In the 1930s or 40s, you could have a job as a computer.

475
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:11,080
If that was your job, you would be given the task of taking equations and processing them

476
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,840
in a logical mathematical fashion.

477
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:22,600
So reasoning is being reduced to computation.

478
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,700
We'll talk about what that might mean in a minute.

479
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:36,060
The idea is if we can make our minds into purely computational machines, then we will

480
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,500
achieve certainty.

481
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:47,260
Certainty in our beliefs will give us what Descartes thinks we need in order to alleviate

482
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,300
the anxiety that we're suffering.

483
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,880
Of course, we do that, right?

484
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:01,960
On one hand, we have the cultural grammar of Luther and the narcissism and the radical

485
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,960
self-doubt.

486
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,000
On the other hand, we have the Cartesian grammar.

487
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,880
We seek certainty.

488
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:13,040
We won't believe anything until it's certain.

489
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,680
Of course, we vacillate between, I must accept it without any evidence or reason, Luther.

490
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:23,340
I can only accept it if it's absolutely certain and beyond question, Descartes.

491
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:28,180
And both of these, of course, are pathological.

492
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:34,060
The first is pathological because if you completely remove people's agency in how they come to

493
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:42,180
their beliefs, then you radically undermine any meaning in life they might possess.

494
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,980
The other one, the pursuit of certainty.

495
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:50,440
And there are individuals who seem to speak as if mathematical science will still give

496
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,560
us certainty.

497
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,560
That's an illusion.

498
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,200
Part of what we discover after Descartes, and Descartes was also surprised in that people

499
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:07,720
ended up disagreeing with him, is that science doesn't and can't provide certainty.

500
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,360
These two equations I put up on the board.

501
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,440
This is from Einstein.

502
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,280
This is from Newton.

503
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,660
What Einstein showed is things that Newton thought were certain, absolute space and time,

504
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:26,100
these kinds of formula, actually don't possess the certainty that Newton thought they did.

505
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:36,220
We'll talk a little bit later about why we can't accept in very limited context.

506
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:41,460
There are deep, deep reasons why we can't pursue certainty.

507
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:50,120
And therefore we can't seek certainty as a solution to loss of connection, connection

508
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,400
to our self, connection to the world, connection to other minds.

509
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,680
Now, why does Descartes, again this radical irony, very similar to Luther, why does Descartes

510
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:10,720
attempt to address this burgeoning loss of connections?

511
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,300
What does it actually result in exactly the opposite, increased sense of disconnectedness?

512
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:23,140
Part of it, of course, is the failure of the project of certainty.

513
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:33,340
You can understand the 18th and the 19th, and especially the 20th centuries as scientific,

514
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:40,280
historical, and philosophical undermining of the idea that we can achieve certainty.

515
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:51,280
Of course, one of the great principles of modern physics is the uncertainty principle.

516
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,280
But let's go back.

517
00:50:52,280 --> 00:51:00,800
So Descartes proposes that we should do this, but there's an individual at his time who's

518
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,860
a contemporary of Descartes, who makes it explicit and radical, and then challenges

519
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,500
Descartes with that radical derivation.

520
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:21,900
Hobbes says, well, you know, all of this, what this means is that cognition is computation.

521
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,180
Hobbes says that, he uses an older word, he says, rathiosination, what we would now say

522
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,180
is cognition.

523
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,780
By rathiosination I mean computation.

524
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,680
Computation is computation.

525
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:42,520
Now, there's a lot of people who were going to disagree with this model of computation.

526
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,400
There's a lot of discussion right now, Brian Cantwell-Smith, a colleague of mine at the

527
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,840
University of Toronto, does a lot of important work on the metaphysics of computation.

528
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,200
I am not trying to state that this is the absolute truth about computation.

529
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,080
That, of course, would be ironic, given what I just said about certainty.

530
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,740
All I am arguing is, historically, this has been the interpretation of what computation

531
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,340
was for people like Descartes and Hobbes.

532
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,860
That's all we need for this argument.

533
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,300
But Hobbes says, cognition is computation.

534
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,300
And then here's the radical idea he proposes.

535
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:19,660
He takes a new idea, current at the time, remember the idea that matter is a substance.

536
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:25,780
Remember the old Aristotelian idea is matter is pure potential, but with Galileo, matter

537
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,320
is a reality, right, in the sense of a substance.

538
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:34,080
It resists, and it's good that it resists because I need something that resists my will

539
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,800
in order to help me with my biases.

540
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:43,960
So matter is inert, it's resistance, it's really there, I push on it.

541
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:51,600
Notice that again, all that's left of conformity is resistance of will.

542
00:52:51,600 --> 00:53:12,220
Hobbes says, well, matter is real, and what if I built a material machine

543
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:20,500
that did computation?

544
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:26,120
If cognition is just computation, and I can build a machine that does computation, and

545
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,960
some of the first automatic machines are being built at this time, calculating machines,

546
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:38,920
if I can make a material machine that does computation, I will have made cognition.

547
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,680
I will have made mine.

548
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:48,320
Right there, at the heart of the scientific revolution, Hobbes is proposing artificial

549
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,020
intelligence.

550
00:53:52,020 --> 00:54:07,740
Notice how artificial intelligence is a child of the advent of the meaning crisis and the

551
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:08,900
scientific revolution.

552
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,740
It's not a modern idea.

553
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,100
Artificial intelligence goes back to this time.

554
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,720
What is Hobbes doing with this?

555
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:30,000
I said Galileo kills the universe and Copernicus kills the reality of our sense experience,

556
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,960
but Hobbes is doing something way more personal because up till now, you've been isolated

557
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,760
inside your own mind, but at least still there.

558
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,080
I still have something special, unique, something spiritual.

559
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:54,620
Hobbes kills the soul, no soul, because if artificial intelligence is right, if I can

560
00:54:54,620 --> 00:55:00,820
build a machine, purely material machine that is capable of computation, then I will have

561
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:11,580
made a mind and I didn't have to involve any soul stuff, any spirit stuff in making it.

562
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
And that's radical.

563
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:20,360
Take a look at how Descartes responds to that and how deep that response is woven into our

564
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:30,000
culture and the meaning crisis and how we move between AI and Descartes even today.

565
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,360
Thank you very much for your time and attention.
