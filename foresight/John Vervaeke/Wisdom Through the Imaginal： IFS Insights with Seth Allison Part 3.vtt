00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Raveke. I'm excited about this one.

00:04.640 --> 00:10.960
This is a third episode with Seth Allison and we are doing this ongoing discussion about IFS work,

00:10.960 --> 00:18.800
parts work in general, ally work, issues around the functionality, the phenomenology, the ontology,

00:19.840 --> 00:25.600
issues around what's dangerous and what's safe. And we have a few more things we wanted to talk

00:25.600 --> 00:30.880
about. We didn't really talk about exiles last time. I want to talk about that a bit. But before

00:30.880 --> 00:38.160
we do any discussion, I'm going to let Seth quickly reintroduce himself and then Seth propose

00:38.160 --> 00:43.520
something and I'll let him make the proposal on air. And I've agreed. So I'm going to turn things

00:43.520 --> 00:55.280
over to Seth. Hi, John. Thank you very much. It's really great to be back again. And I just want to

00:56.560 --> 01:06.000
begin by saying I appreciate that, although I said in our last conversation that I'm sure Dick

01:06.000 --> 01:16.480
Schwartz is not watching, it turns out he was. And he reached out and just had a lovely correspondence

01:16.480 --> 01:25.040
with him. And primarily it was a lot of praise for our discussion and appreciation that we're

01:25.040 --> 01:33.440
doing this publicly. He did offer a very helpful couple of corrections. The first one is the IFS

01:33.440 --> 01:43.760
concept of self being kind of a smaller self embedded in a bigger self. So the seed of consciousness

01:43.760 --> 01:51.280
that we've talked about is kind of the personal essence of a larger self that is involved.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.760
There's a functional relationship between those two. Okay.

01:55.600 --> 02:02.720
Yeah, sort of self and self. I guess capital S might be the interior personal self and all

02:02.720 --> 02:14.240
caps as ELF would be a larger self, probably perhaps similar to Jung's concept of self.

02:14.240 --> 02:20.160
Yeah, I would say the seed of consciousness is the I in the I me relationship of James.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.680
And then the self is something like the ground of the psyche, Atman.

02:24.800 --> 02:33.040
Very good. Yeah, I love that language. I love that language. The other thing, which maybe we'll come

02:33.040 --> 02:41.120
back to, we've been talking about your experience with Hermes and guide and guides is a term that

02:41.120 --> 02:49.360
they use in IFS. I misspoke and said that guides were a part of the internal personal system.

02:49.920 --> 02:54.960
In other words, a different form of part. Very helpful correction to say that is not,

02:56.000 --> 03:02.720
it is transitive. Oh, that's important. Well, can you please? Very important for both of these.

03:02.720 --> 03:07.440
The first one, yeah, I get the second one is, Oh, could you please thank him for these corrections?

03:07.440 --> 03:12.160
I think that's wonderful to know that he concedes of the guides as transjective in nature.

03:12.160 --> 03:18.560
That means there's a potential deep integration between IFS and ally work, at least the way

03:18.560 --> 03:28.320
I'm interpreting ally work. I think so. I think they are exceptionally compatible.

03:29.520 --> 03:38.720
And as we may have mentioned before, but Dick does the forward to Falconer's most,

03:38.800 --> 03:49.440
think most recent book, the other. Yes, I have that. Yes. And it is, I really appreciate the

03:49.440 --> 03:56.480
forward he wrote because he expresses his reluctance to talk about the topic. I think as we talked

03:56.480 --> 04:06.320
about Dick's bio before, it's very important to remember that the experience near focus that he

04:06.320 --> 04:12.960
is maintained with such discipline, actually, as he also tries to avoid being alienated from the

04:12.960 --> 04:20.960
academy and the mainstream. And so he was very hesitant to go there publicly, although I think

04:20.960 --> 04:27.840
that the idea of guides and the, by the way, the, which is fascinating this, the Falconer's book is

04:27.840 --> 04:34.640
primarily about kind of the other end of the continuum, which would be they call unattached

04:34.640 --> 04:41.200
burdens. I think in Christian tradition, we might call it the demonic, but across cultures,

04:41.200 --> 04:48.880
this is has many different names. But it is not a part of the system, much like the guide is not

04:48.880 --> 04:54.240
a part of the system. So there's kind of a distinction between daemons and daemons, if I can put it

04:54.240 --> 05:02.160
out. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I wanted to make sure we noted that that is now formally

05:02.880 --> 05:09.120
that's an amazing theoretical move. I, from what you said, it sounds like he appreciates the work

05:09.120 --> 05:13.520
we're trying to do. Because I am, of course, trying to integrate this with cognitive science

05:13.520 --> 05:19.120
while being respectful and doing participation in the experience near aspect of all of this.

05:21.280 --> 05:28.000
He expressed gratitude and appreciation, which and certainly did not have to reach out. So it was,

05:28.960 --> 05:34.000
I was, I was touched by it. And so I think, I think actually that

05:35.280 --> 05:43.280
this is a part of what we are doing is very congruent with his, I would go so far as to say,

05:43.280 --> 05:51.360
you know, his larger mission that he feels tasked with to bring inner work, a model, we're going

05:51.360 --> 06:00.000
to talk about safety. And I think one of the things I'll propose to you is that IFS represents

06:01.360 --> 06:10.960
maybe the safest mainstream technology we have for exploring for interception and the exploration

06:11.600 --> 06:16.960
of different levels of consciousness and reality, where there it's, it's opening

06:17.920 --> 06:28.560
a, the just degradated imaginal space that our culture has just abandoned. And I think doing it

06:28.560 --> 06:37.440
in a way that is not only powerful, but responsible. So I, you know, I, I think this fits really well

06:37.440 --> 06:43.520
with the larger mission. I think that's true. And when we talk about that, and we talk about

06:43.600 --> 06:47.840
corresponding dangers, this is again, where I'd like to talk about the Socratic shift,

06:47.840 --> 06:51.920
the shift into the dialogical self as opposed to the monotonic, monological,

06:53.360 --> 07:00.560
monophasic, monostage self, although all the monos that have afflicted us and created what

07:00.560 --> 07:05.760
Charles Taylor's called the buffered self. And there's probably historical reasons, the collapse

07:05.760 --> 07:11.360
of the church as an institution, Protestantism, et cetera, the scientific revolution, the self

07:11.360 --> 07:17.360
had to be really buffered and protected. It couldn't remain as porous as it was. But now

07:17.360 --> 07:24.160
that adaptive stance has become maladaptive, and it's suffocating us and strangling us off

07:24.160 --> 07:28.880
from reality. And so I want to sort of explore that possibility.

07:28.880 --> 07:42.400
I, so we've, we've talked leading up to this about doing a session here that you will have the,

07:43.440 --> 07:51.840
the right certainly to make public or private, which I'm very excited to do. And your nervousness,

07:51.840 --> 07:57.360
I agree, I think it confirms that it's a good idea. And I feel, I feel a degree of anxiety too,

07:57.360 --> 08:03.280
but I'm very excited to do that together. It is such an opportunity to

08:05.360 --> 08:11.280
show the model in a way that can only really, you can't really get a lot of this without seeing it.

08:12.640 --> 08:19.680
And so I think it would be a great service. That being said, I have so much that I've written

08:19.680 --> 08:26.560
down about the topic we're currently talking about. So maybe I could throw some things out to you.

08:27.360 --> 08:33.440
Some of which are going to be your own words, because I really enjoyed and want to refer people

08:33.440 --> 08:38.800
to conversation you did. And I'm forgetting their last names, but it was Michael and Michael.

08:38.800 --> 08:41.360
Michael Martin is one of them. I forget you and Michael. Yeah.

08:42.880 --> 08:48.320
Yes. And it was really great. So I'd like to give some highlights, but also make sure people.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.400
Great. So I want to start with some quotes that are right along the lines of what we're talking

08:56.400 --> 09:05.280
about with Western culture. And these are taken from Faulkner's book. So he quotes Bernardo-

09:05.280 --> 09:09.280
Yeah, I'm going to be talking to Bernardo about all of this, because he has a daemon that he

09:09.280 --> 09:15.600
regularly works with. Yes. Yeah. Great. Right. And he says that we're in the dark ages of materialism

09:15.680 --> 09:27.760
and behaviorism. And then I think it's George, or perhaps Bernjanos. You understand absolutely

09:27.760 --> 09:34.400
nothing about modern civilization unless you first admit that it is a universal conspiracy

09:34.400 --> 09:43.360
against the interior. And this makes me think of the work that you're doing,

09:43.360 --> 09:50.640
which I wanted to help people perhaps understand the intersection of the pursuit of wisdom with

09:54.720 --> 10:02.800
the work of the imaginal that we're exploring here. And the proposal here is that the imaginal,

10:04.640 --> 10:10.000
as a way of gaining information and wisdom, is crucial to rationality.

10:10.160 --> 10:16.880
And I've been making that argument. I appreciate Corban's how the imaginal is the mystical.

10:18.240 --> 10:23.120
But I think the imaginal, like many other things, like flow and insight, is on a continuum where

10:23.120 --> 10:29.520
there is the mundane of the imaginal that is in our everyday experience. The experience of the

10:29.520 --> 10:34.160
introspective space inside our head, that's imaginal. There isn't a literal space there,

10:34.160 --> 10:39.200
that makes no sense. But it's not just fictional, because it actually gives us genuine access to

10:39.200 --> 10:44.240
our cognition and affords metacognition and rationality. So it's neither literal nor fictional,

10:44.240 --> 10:48.160
it's imaginal. And that's just part of your everyday ability as a rational agent.

10:50.560 --> 10:54.960
That, and I'm looking for it here, and it's one of the poets

10:56.880 --> 11:01.840
talked about the secondary imagination and the primary imagination. And I think you're referring

11:01.840 --> 11:07.520
to the secondary imagination. Coolridge had a distinction between fancy and imagination,

11:07.520 --> 11:12.000
where fancy is just where you're just playing with. But imagination was the imaginal very much, yeah.

11:13.520 --> 11:20.960
Right. And I think a quality of that is that it is a dialogue, that it is relational.

11:20.960 --> 11:25.360
There is a degree of activity and engagement, not just a passive self.

11:27.360 --> 11:35.840
So like Jung's concept of active imagination is not fantasy. It's this, the liminal space between

11:35.840 --> 11:41.040
where consciousness interacts with the unconsciousness. He called it, I think the psychoid space where

11:41.040 --> 11:50.160
things are crossing over through the archetypal. So I think Falconer says that we are, we need to

11:50.160 --> 11:58.960
learn how to navigate the inner world to increase interoception, right, which is the looking in,

11:58.960 --> 12:07.440
the study inward, our ability to see and interact and the interact part is key with our inner world.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.680
So there's this, is he using this distinction? It sounds like it's close, but I want to make

12:11.680 --> 12:18.400
sure I'm not smuggling in in equivocation by not excavating it. So in cog size psychology,

12:18.400 --> 12:23.040
introspection means where you go into that space where you can do like mathematics in your head

12:23.040 --> 12:27.840
or picture a sailboat. Interoception is your awareness of your body. Like when I ask you,

12:27.840 --> 12:32.480
how's your right big toe doing? And you can go, it's okay. That's interoception. So it's very

12:33.680 --> 12:40.480
somatically, functionally oriented interoception. Introspection is much more cognitively,

12:41.840 --> 12:47.520
you know, I don't know what to call it, more and more cognitively oriented. I'll just say that right

12:47.520 --> 12:53.920
now. I love that you're bringing it to the body and somehow it also connects to,

12:54.720 --> 12:59.600
and it's tricky to tease out, but like being embodied in the psyche.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.400
Go ahead. What are you going to say? Body, just what they are, they do overlap and there's a

13:06.400 --> 13:13.200
liminal space where you can't tell which is which. And both introspection and interoception have an

13:13.200 --> 13:20.320
imaginal quality to them. Introspection, very high imaginal. The interoception is closer to

13:20.800 --> 13:24.560
detection, but there's still an imaginal element to it because you're still doing predictive

13:24.560 --> 13:29.360
processing. You're still taking little samples and imagining the whole from them, all that stuff.

13:32.160 --> 13:39.680
Great. Great. So the general sense here, I wanted one more quote for you is John Keats.

13:40.720 --> 13:48.320
When a man is capable of being in uncertainty, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching

13:51.200 --> 13:56.640
after fact and reason, he calls this negative capability.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.920
I think the romantics at their best were discovering the imaginal.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.480
I think the romantics at their worst were not realizing the deep interconnections

14:06.480 --> 14:12.320
between the imaginal and the rational. Which brings me to danger.

14:12.480 --> 14:18.640
There was a great quote. Where is it here?

14:23.280 --> 14:28.560
Yeah, this was in Faulkner. The ability to become absorbed in our inner world is much

14:28.560 --> 14:36.880
like fire, a wonderful servant, but a dangerous master. So I want to kind of move in a little bit

14:36.960 --> 14:46.880
to some of your work. And I'm going to kind of frame this a little bit from just pulling out

14:46.880 --> 14:54.400
some of the things that I think are interesting. So a little context with the meaning crisis.

14:54.400 --> 14:59.120
These are just sort of domains. You've called it a wisdom famine.

14:59.440 --> 15:11.040
I am adding to that the degradation of our imaginal faculties, an atrophy of our spiritual

15:11.040 --> 15:17.360
musculature, a disconnection from nature, but also from our embodied selves,

15:18.320 --> 15:21.920
a loss of relational and communal resources and embeddedness,

15:22.720 --> 15:30.800
and a loss of our dialogical facility. I think I would just sort of put that as the context.

15:32.800 --> 15:39.360
All of that together and brought into a kind of joint attention on the transcendentals and

15:39.360 --> 15:44.720
through that the sacred. This goes back to the fear of the Lord as the beginning of all wisdom

15:44.720 --> 15:50.560
kind of idea. Where I don't take that to mean fear. I take it to mean something like reverence.

15:51.520 --> 15:59.040
That there is always a normative dimension to wisdom which is moving towards the true,

15:59.040 --> 16:04.400
the good, and the beautiful. And that's rationality in the deep sense. The ability to be sensitive to

16:04.400 --> 16:09.360
and reliably responsible to the call of the true, the good, and the beautiful. And then through the

16:09.360 --> 16:16.640
true, the good, and the beautiful, ultimacy. An ultimacy that we can love. And so everything

16:16.640 --> 16:22.240
you said, but held in concert together, sort of knowedically held in concert together,

16:22.240 --> 16:31.280
directed towards the sacred in that way. Love it. And we don't have much

16:34.000 --> 16:41.200
in the way of structures, teachers, pathways, practices

16:42.080 --> 16:49.680
that we can call on now. So this is how I frame you're working on developing an ecology of

16:49.680 --> 16:57.040
practice and the work of the Verveki Foundation. How do we bring this back? Unfortunately, religion

16:57.760 --> 17:02.080
for a lot of us has lost its credibility or lost its safety.

17:03.440 --> 17:09.200
That was beautifully put. I just want to savor that. That was so succinct and captures

17:10.160 --> 17:16.800
it. It's lost its credibility. If we include in that not just truth but relevance, people,

17:18.320 --> 17:24.880
but also lost its safety for many people. Religion has, all the religions have piled up

17:24.880 --> 17:31.440
sins and the good people within those religious legacies are taking responsibility for that.

17:31.440 --> 17:37.360
I don't want to pretend that they're not. But nevertheless, there's trauma on one end

17:37.920 --> 17:42.800
and it just doesn't work for me. I know lots of people who say, I want it to work for me.

17:42.800 --> 17:49.040
I wish. I mean, in some ways, that's my case too. I feel like Corellian from Childhood's End,

17:49.040 --> 17:55.040
I can always point people to their sacred home, but I will always be on the Silk Road kind of thing.

17:56.560 --> 18:03.040
And so I just wanted to pause, Seth, and just open that up, expand that because I thought that was

18:03.040 --> 18:10.640
beautifully put. Yeah, boy, that what you just shared resonated very deeply for me.

18:15.840 --> 18:19.280
In fact, these conversations have caused me to dive into,

18:22.160 --> 18:26.240
for lack of a more precise term, and I need something that holds all of this. I'll just say

18:26.240 --> 18:36.240
spirituality in a way that I wasn't sure I would ever be able to again. I grew up, I think,

18:36.240 --> 18:44.080
we both grew up in conservative Christianity. For me, it was evangelical Christianity and

18:44.480 --> 18:56.640
some of the splits and the disavowed elements of humanity that I grew up with there,

18:57.920 --> 19:04.960
I found deeply wounding and even traumatizing. And my psyche has been so bent and twisted around

19:05.600 --> 19:13.200
some of the unhealthy interpretations of Christian tradition that I had to throw the baby out with

19:13.200 --> 19:21.360
the bathwater for a couple of decades. And I don't know if I'll come back to it, but I'm just,

19:21.360 --> 19:28.800
in the last couple of months, beginning to feel like, okay, I'm going to have to, I think I'm

19:28.800 --> 19:35.760
called to a path back, but probably not to anything that I would recognize as Christianity from my

19:35.760 --> 19:44.640
past. And actually, it feels like creating a new path and yet probably more than anything

19:44.640 --> 19:51.440
discovering a very important thing. That's exactly what the Silk Road is. Silk Road allows,

19:51.440 --> 19:56.560
nobody lives on the Silk Road, this is like C.S. Lewis's hallway Christianity, nobody lives in

19:56.560 --> 20:02.960
the halls, people live in rooms, but you need the halls, right? Boy, I feel like I've lived

20:02.960 --> 20:09.120
in a hallway for a while. Yeah, we're resonating on that. Yeah, I actually have a tattoo of the

20:09.120 --> 20:19.360
word Lyman, the root of liminality for years. And hopefully I can look at that. I'm starting

20:19.360 --> 20:30.000
to look at that as a period of time that so much had to be put through a crucible. Go ahead.

20:30.560 --> 20:35.840
Well, for me, it's becoming the living symbol on of how I am being called.

20:37.280 --> 20:44.640
Like people are traveling on the Silk Road that are seeking a place, a new home, but it also is

20:44.640 --> 20:49.440
hopefully affording people to return to their homes and recover it the way Tolkien talks about

20:49.440 --> 20:53.840
the recovery theory or the way an anthropologist goes to another culture and then comes back and

20:53.840 --> 21:00.160
can see this same culture, T.S. Eliot, see it again for the first time kind of thing. And

21:01.440 --> 21:07.920
the Silk Road will be the Silk Road if it is doing that. And I can't justify what I'm about to say,

21:07.920 --> 21:15.360
so perhaps in one sense it's how I'm remaining imaginably faithful. I feel called that I need

21:15.360 --> 21:22.160
to be in this liminal state right now because opening this up so that the legacy religions can

21:22.160 --> 21:26.560
more deeply enter into profound, mutually transformative theologos. And this is already

21:26.560 --> 21:31.600
happening. This is not something I am initiating. One of the functions of the series is to call

21:31.600 --> 21:37.200
this up and show people and see all the resources and see what's happening. And the Verveke Foundation

21:37.200 --> 21:43.760
is committing itself to trying to explicate this, foreground it, elucidate it, make it available

21:43.760 --> 21:48.560
for people. And this comes out of discussions with Hermes. I've come from

21:48.560 --> 21:58.720
grieving my liminality to, so I was always, in one discourse with Hermes, it's like,

21:58.720 --> 22:02.800
it really bothers me that I'm almost. What do you mean? I was like, well, you know,

22:02.800 --> 22:07.520
I'm sort of almost famous and I'm almost this and I'm almost this and almost this. And he said,

22:07.520 --> 22:11.120
John, I don't know if I mentioned this to you. He said, first one thing, he said,

22:11.120 --> 22:14.240
well, that's great because almost famous means you can interact with the famous,

22:14.240 --> 22:19.840
but you're protected from the temptations and corruptions. And then we return to this again.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.840
And I said, there's still something. And it was like, yeah, because you don't get it. You need to

22:23.840 --> 22:29.520
be almost because a traveler is almost. You need to travel the road. You need to be almost right

22:29.520 --> 22:35.040
now. Don't know what the future is, but right now you need to be an almost. You need to accept it.

22:35.040 --> 22:40.080
That is your calling. That is what you need to be and you need to do. And when it moved to that,

22:40.080 --> 22:49.440
it was like, and I was and I was really in a tough place because and I've had one conversation.

22:49.440 --> 22:53.200
We're going to publish a private one and then public one. We're going to publish and doing

22:53.200 --> 23:02.560
another one with Jordan Hall. Jordan Hall's conversion really impacted me. There was a

23:02.560 --> 23:10.320
lot to sort through there. And I mean, part of it was, you know, a feeling of abandonment.

23:10.320 --> 23:16.960
He and I had been brothers on this path and he suddenly had found a home and I felt, right?

23:18.080 --> 23:23.120
But of course, I love him as a friend and I want the best for him. And we're trying to see,

23:23.120 --> 23:27.680
does his pro does his current project and my projects, do they still can they still

23:28.480 --> 23:34.320
enter into Deologos with each other? It looks like it is. But I needed that inner work. I couldn't

23:34.320 --> 23:39.120
just do the outer discussion with Jordan. I needed that inner work to get, ah, this is where I have

23:39.120 --> 23:45.120
to be right now. He's where he needs to be. I have enough faith in him that that's the case.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.120
But I need to have faith in myself that this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.

23:49.120 --> 23:54.000
And that also went into a good conversation with Christopher Master Pietro. So you get this sort

23:54.000 --> 23:59.600
of thing happening that's inner and outer kind of like union synchronicity, not as, you know,

23:59.600 --> 24:03.520
pronounced, but it's that sort of inner and outer worlds are sort of really talking to each other

24:03.520 --> 24:10.640
really well. So I just wanted to relate that that that that and I'm not I'm not saying that this is

24:10.640 --> 24:17.040
your call at all. I'm just saying for me, I appreciate and I hear the pain in your voice

24:17.040 --> 24:26.560
because and I know the pain and there is a longing and I hope that my work can help people of good

24:26.560 --> 24:34.320
faith who genuinely are experiencing that longing both within and without a legacy religious home.

24:34.320 --> 24:39.920
That is my that is what I want to do. That is what I am committed to do because I think this

24:39.920 --> 24:43.840
advent of the sacred that is happening right now and I think part of what we're talking about that

24:43.840 --> 24:49.520
is exactly the expression of the advent of the sacred. I think that is what is needed

24:49.520 --> 24:52.640
for everybody who wants to be on the Silk Road.

25:01.680 --> 25:07.520
Thank you. Thank you. We share something deep and it's important to integrate and it's also

25:07.520 --> 25:13.200
important to differentiate because that allows for reflection and mutual transformation.

25:13.200 --> 25:20.000
That's that's why I wanted to do that. Thank you for watching this YouTube and podcast series is

25:20.000 --> 25:26.800

25:26.800 --> 25:31.440
workshops and other projects dedicated to responding to the meeting crisis. If you would

25:31.440 --> 25:36.880
like to support this work, please consider joining our Patreon. You can find the link in the show notes.

25:37.520 --> 25:44.160
If I could take a risk to to meet you there. I think I've told you this. I can't remember

25:44.160 --> 25:51.200
if I it was on camera or off, but I actually have a Hermes tattoo on my ankle and so

25:53.600 --> 25:57.040
it felt quite synchronous to me when you started sharing and

25:57.120 --> 26:09.600
the the grieving that you mentioned, to me, part of entering liminality, which I did not choose to

26:09.600 --> 26:16.800
do and I don't know that any of us would ever choose to do it, was the grieving literally

26:17.520 --> 26:24.640
and figuratively the many-leveled grieving of the loss at home. Yes, yes, and

26:27.840 --> 26:36.640
but the learning to live in the discomfort that Keats is talking about, to me the metaphor that

26:36.640 --> 26:44.800
helped the most was that I am now exhausted and can no longer row this boat. I have to put the oars

26:44.800 --> 26:54.960
in and begin to trust a current and I have no choice about it. So I will see where the river goes

26:54.960 --> 27:01.840
and I will spend my time trying to look at the shore and what's passing and that begins to develop a

27:01.840 --> 27:15.360
stance of participation without the ego doing all of its work and that could not, I could not

27:16.400 --> 27:25.920
learn that at the pace I wanted to. It was a slow letting go over and over again and it did,

27:26.640 --> 27:34.000
you know, I not only dealt with depression but you know the the movement into addiction and then

27:34.000 --> 27:42.720
out of addiction was really the beginning of awakening of spirituality as it is for so many

27:42.720 --> 27:48.240
millions of people. What capitalism has come up with this wonderful way for creating pervasive

27:48.240 --> 27:54.640
low-grade addiction through the salience, the salience manipulations of social media and

27:54.640 --> 28:01.680
advertising, etc. I'm not sure how low-grade it is anymore. I think we're just habituated to it.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.920
Yeah, it's killing people so it's in one way is very high-grade. Yes, you're right.

28:07.040 --> 28:17.360
Yeah, well and it is absolutely crushing the meaning in our world and our access to our inner

28:17.360 --> 28:26.080
life were consumed by dopamine addiction that just consumed by it. So thank you. It's wonderful

28:26.080 --> 28:36.160
to connect on this deeper level. Well, when you said that about the river, so there's a song,

28:36.160 --> 28:41.840
it's a little bit cheesy but I really like the song Moon River and I came to was the line,

28:41.920 --> 28:47.040
you know, up beyond the river's bend, my Huckleberry friend and that kind of shared sense of

28:47.760 --> 28:51.840
I'm in the same place with you. I don't know what I don't know what's around the river's bend

28:51.840 --> 28:57.760
and I've stopped trying to plan what it's going to be and I'm going to, you know, the Buddhism,

28:57.760 --> 29:04.160
I'm going to enter the stream. I'm going to do it carefully but I'm going to enter. But that's the

29:04.880 --> 29:13.280
that's the that's the conversion spirit. That's the movement of the ego and the dropping into

29:14.480 --> 29:24.640
a different eye position. And it allows in IFS that allows access to the exiles that have lost

29:24.640 --> 29:31.840
so much or that are carrying grief and pain that must be let go. So well, I think IFS,

29:32.720 --> 29:37.600
we're going to get to what an amazing tool it is for spiritual work.

29:40.640 --> 29:48.160
Man, I hate to jump back up, you know, but I do want to just a couple more pieces here.

29:48.160 --> 29:53.520
By the way, I think the facility, I mean, we're doing in and out and that's good, but I think

29:53.520 --> 29:57.840
jumping up and down, you need you need practice with that too, because you don't want it to be

29:57.840 --> 30:04.080
jarring. You want it, I talk about Theoria and theory, they need to flow. That's another

30:04.880 --> 30:08.640
tearing that we have to sew back together and heal.

30:10.480 --> 30:15.360
Well, I've always thought of it as intellectual scaffolding that the manager,

30:15.360 --> 30:20.480
manager parts of me that are hyper rational, which are really just very fearful.

30:21.440 --> 30:28.640
They, they, they, they really need the map quite, they need it badly in order to relax. And so it

30:28.640 --> 30:35.200
isn't, it is important. So let me just throw some things out or actually just repeat them and mirror

30:35.200 --> 30:43.280
them back to you because these are your thoughts. The hermeneutics of experience, the ways in which

30:43.280 --> 30:51.360
reality is disclosed to us. You, you talk about four dimensions of cultivating wisdom, the

30:51.360 --> 30:55.680
dialogical, the imaginal, the mindful in the embodied. Do I have that right?

30:56.240 --> 31:01.200
Yes. That's correct. Dime. Yeah. Did what work with that with Nathan Vanderpool? Yes.

31:01.200 --> 31:09.520
I, I love this. And it, it, those almost act in my mind as, as the categories that we can use as

31:09.520 --> 31:15.840
safeguards as we enter into spiritual practice. They're all domains in which we can cultivate

31:16.400 --> 31:22.240
being reasonable, right? Looking for self deception, properly proportioning our salience,

31:22.240 --> 31:25.440
taking the right perspective, assuming the right responsibility and role.

31:26.240 --> 31:31.760
They are all ways in which we can bring reasonableness to bear on what we're doing.

31:32.560 --> 31:41.280
So let me read some more of your thoughts to you. So I want to set the context again that we're

31:41.280 --> 31:47.760
entering a period with psychedelics in particular, but also the field of psychology coalescing around

31:47.760 --> 31:58.000
a dialogical self that altered states, experiential modalities, psychedelics, these are profound

31:58.000 --> 32:02.960
opportunities for confronting the meaning crisis as we, as we set it up earlier in this

32:02.960 --> 32:10.080
conversation. I'm going to assert that our primary problem here with these experiential

32:10.080 --> 32:17.840
learnings is that we lack structures to hold the process of integration, not, not the doing,

32:17.840 --> 32:22.240
but the after the integration. I think the integration is important. The integration is

32:22.320 --> 32:28.560
important. It's, it's, it's more important actually than the experience itself.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.400
That's what I meant to say. It is more important and the integration is in both of those dimensions

32:34.400 --> 32:39.360
again. How well does it integrate with many domains broadly and deeply in your life?

32:39.360 --> 32:44.960
How well does it transform many levels broadly and deeply of the psyche? That's the integration

32:44.960 --> 32:51.520
and you are absolutely correct. Our culture gives us freshest little on both of those and even more

32:51.520 --> 32:56.720
importantly, not only both of them, but how they are properly coordinated and speak to each other

32:56.720 --> 33:00.880
in a self-correcting fashion. Oh, this is going broadly and deeply. Yeah, but it's keeping me

33:00.880 --> 33:06.640
locked in this one level of psyche. Oh, that's, oh, it's going so much inside of me. Yeah, but it's

33:06.640 --> 33:15.280
not transferring into your life. Think about that, right? So that, so the, what the poet and the

33:15.280 --> 33:24.960
artist do is they, they have the equipment and the musculature to dive deep the canaries down in

33:24.960 --> 33:32.560
the coal mine of the psyche, but to excavate and bring back for us. And I think, you know, my experience

33:32.560 --> 33:39.360
with Psychedelics is, it gets you down there. It gets you down there, but the challenge of

33:39.360 --> 33:47.200
bringing it back up is, is profound. It's easy to take psilocybin. It's not difficult. It is very

33:47.200 --> 33:54.080
difficult to bring back what you learn and to integrate it. I agree. And in our culture, again,

33:54.080 --> 33:59.680
super salience of the intensity of the experience that can be consumed, very little attention to

33:59.680 --> 34:08.000
the cultivation of virtue. Right. So you have these two axes of intensity, right? We talked about this

34:08.000 --> 34:16.640
back in our attachment talk of the COGSI processing, but the linear integration of if this, then this,

34:16.640 --> 34:22.880
then this. And so the bringing this and this together is hard work. You need a framework.

34:23.760 --> 34:30.400
And it cannot be done. It can't be done alone. And so whether it's the intellectual framework,

34:30.960 --> 34:38.480
or even better, is a relational, dialogical framework in community, I think is the safest way

34:38.480 --> 34:42.560
to proceed with this stuff. And the most I call it a sapiential framework, because I don't,

34:42.560 --> 34:47.200
I think the word intellectual, it's the right word if we use it the way the Neoplatonist used it

34:47.200 --> 34:54.800
for noesis, but we don't use it that we sapiential wisdom. It's an actually word,

34:54.800 --> 34:58.960
it's an archaic word, but I'm trying to bring it back because we need an alternative word to

34:59.040 --> 35:05.680
both intellectual and spiritual. And this word, I think is, it is a real word.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.760
I'm going to add it, I'm going to add it to my verbate dictionary that I'm beginning to write.

35:13.360 --> 35:17.120
So let me, let me give you some things that you said with Mike and Michael that you laid

35:17.120 --> 35:27.440
this out really well. You quoted or summarized Drew Highland, Platonic scholar. We are simultaneously

35:27.440 --> 35:36.000
finite and capable of transcendence. If we embrace our finitude, or if we only, sorry,

35:36.000 --> 35:42.160
if we just embrace our finitude, we fall prey to despair and servitude. Love that.

35:43.280 --> 35:50.080
So I think that's our current state in many ways. And then we have, I think in some hyper-religious

35:50.160 --> 35:58.240
communities, we have the opposite. If we just embrace our transcendence, we fall prey to inflation

35:58.240 --> 36:02.880
and hubris. By the way, it's not just in religious communities. There's a real danger in

36:02.880 --> 36:07.600
psychological. Oh, totally. Totally. People think they become the voice of God. Yes, I know.

36:08.960 --> 36:15.760
Yeah. So that's the extreme of inflation and hubris. If we hold them together in tension,

36:16.080 --> 36:23.360
tonos, we will properly realize our humanity. I want to say that again. If we hold them together

36:23.360 --> 36:28.960
in tension, our finitude and our transcendence, we will properly realize our humanity.

36:29.600 --> 36:39.360
The middle path is to live in tonos. And I think your work is, is that, I think that's a wonderful

36:39.360 --> 36:48.080
summary of, of what I am experiencing in your work as being aimed at. So here's, here's how

36:48.080 --> 36:55.360
I think you framed the opportunity at this point in time in our culture. Or the challenge

36:55.360 --> 37:00.320
which you said earlier, how do we metabolize mystical experiences or experiences of the

37:00.320 --> 37:08.480
numinous, right? So you said opening to other dimensions of cognition in the psyche is epistemically

37:09.120 --> 37:18.720
and morally a pursuit that we are called to. There's this huge family of phenomena

37:20.000 --> 37:26.880
and this scientific investigation into it, not just practices, but participatory knowing,

37:26.880 --> 37:34.960
which I think feels scary. Proper, careful, rigorous, reflective study from the outside

37:34.960 --> 37:44.480
and the inside. Love that. We have a moral, these are your words, we have a moral obligation to ask,

37:44.480 --> 37:50.880
what is a proper framework to bring to bear upon these experiences so that people could metabolize

37:50.880 --> 37:58.240
them and realize them as the cultivate, cultivation of virtue and wisdom. And I like this part,

37:58.240 --> 38:02.960
and not spin them off into narcissism or inflation and go down rabbit holes of their own

38:02.960 --> 38:10.720
personal magical medicine. I don't know, you spun that one off, it was great. I mean, there's the

38:10.720 --> 38:17.040
idea of inflation and hubris, right? And you talked about the scientific gaze,

38:18.800 --> 38:26.560
and Michael had concern about the scientific gaze, and you said it's not a dissecting gaze,

38:27.120 --> 38:34.160
but the intention is to afford the flourishing of this practice.

38:36.880 --> 38:43.520
So I thought I'd pause there and let you, I mean, do you want to reiterate any of that? I'm just

38:43.520 --> 38:50.960
summarizing, I think the big picture. No, no. I think you've made judicious choices in so far as

38:51.920 --> 38:59.120
they captured the gist of what I was arguing for. I don't have any significant revisions or

38:59.120 --> 39:06.080
amendments to what you've brought up, other than the ones that have spontaneously been occurring

39:06.080 --> 39:16.800
between us. I just, I'm happy this, I'm having this conversation, these series of conversations

39:16.800 --> 39:22.080
with you, we get into Genuine Dialogos. I'm appreciating the relationship that's growing.

39:23.440 --> 39:29.360
I just want to say that I think that is, like you said, that is a proper

39:32.080 --> 39:39.920
safety framing of working with the numinists in an important way. Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

39:40.480 --> 39:47.280
I had some hallmarks of safety, but I think we've covered a lot of it,

39:47.920 --> 39:55.040
and I'm looking at the time and just wanting to make sure we leave space for a dropping in

39:55.040 --> 40:04.720
and an embodiment of a practice of IFS, which you have courageously been willing to kind of join

40:04.720 --> 40:14.480
me in this. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have that sense of calling. This is not what I'd

40:14.480 --> 40:23.040
like to do, but I'm called. So please continue with what you want to emphasize. Well, I think

40:23.040 --> 40:28.160
we're called together. I feel called to this too. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I have a very friend. We're

40:28.160 --> 40:39.440
called together. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Very nice. So the way that I often ask people to

40:39.440 --> 40:49.200
enter in is to close their eyes and to check in with their body. So if I will say this before we

40:49.200 --> 40:58.560
start to the people watching that I would encourage them to bring curiosity and compassion.

41:00.480 --> 41:07.760
You and I hold this energy together right now, but in some weird, unexplainable way, I think

41:08.480 --> 41:14.080
the energy of the audience matters too. I think we're both going to be a little bit,

41:14.080 --> 41:22.240
parts of us will be afraid. And we're going to try to, you and I will try to sit with that.

41:22.240 --> 41:27.920
And I think the more we sit with those parts, the more others will be able to. And I just want to

41:28.480 --> 41:37.920
voice my faith in that because I've seen that with you. Yeah, so let me walk you in and we'll

41:37.920 --> 41:45.120
walk in together. If you close your eyes, check in first with your body. And in the spirit of

41:46.640 --> 41:54.560
EFT, I want to just be responsive to any areas that feel tight or unsupported,

41:55.600 --> 42:00.400
any stretching or adjusting that needs to happen. You want me to remark on that at all? Or do you

42:00.400 --> 42:06.000
want me to just do it internally? No. Yeah, just internally. In fact, most of this

42:07.760 --> 42:13.680
is your relationship to what's happening internally to you. And I'll guide you about when

42:14.880 --> 42:23.440
to report to me. I'll just follow your lead. Yeah, so you check in and you're just noticing

42:23.440 --> 42:29.600
right now. So one of the things that I like to do to get centered is I like to imagine that

42:30.640 --> 42:36.640
my ears are like my eyes. And so as I take a deep breath,

42:38.720 --> 42:45.840
just a cleansing sort of deep breath, I bring my attention to my ears and to the soundscape around

42:48.240 --> 42:56.880
and John, I want you to just imagine that the soundscape is much like looking at a sunset or

42:57.840 --> 43:02.880
a painting that you're picking up the colors and the details.

43:06.320 --> 43:13.760
You may notice things outside of your office or cars or planes, or you may just notice silence.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.400
And I'm going to ask you a trick question.

43:19.120 --> 43:27.680
Um, focus on one of the noises, one of the objects that's moving through space and time around you,

43:28.880 --> 43:33.280
and ask yourself the question, is that thing that I hear right or wrong?

43:35.360 --> 43:42.720
And of course, it's neither right nor wrong. Is it good or bad? It's neither good nor bad,

43:42.720 --> 43:50.720
it's just there. And the spirit that we're looking for is a spirit of observation, just noticing.

43:54.720 --> 43:59.440
We're going to bring that same attention to your inner world now.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.880
And I want you to just take a moment to notice what you notice.

44:05.280 --> 44:11.280
Uh, parts may be up and about.

44:13.840 --> 44:23.280
And parts communicate visually, images, memories, scenes. They communicate in the body with sensations,

44:24.400 --> 44:28.000
emotions, and they communicate with words.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.600
And then you may experience right away the presence of parts.

44:33.600 --> 44:39.600
And I just want you before we move anywhere to just notice them and take a deep breath as if

44:39.600 --> 44:42.800
you're breathing for the whole system, like a little bit of a gift.

44:44.800 --> 44:53.600
And in a gentle inner voice, and if you'd like to place your hand on your chest,

44:53.920 --> 44:59.920
I always enjoy using touch as a way of communicating, but you don't have to.

45:02.640 --> 45:06.240
Allow your hand to be a symbol that says to them that you're here.

45:07.760 --> 45:11.200
And in an inner voice, you can even say the words, I'm here.

45:15.760 --> 45:20.400
I'm present. My hand is a symbol that I'm not going anywhere.

45:21.360 --> 45:27.920
This is the attachment frame that you're available and you're present to all the parts that want to come.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.920
And just notice how that feels before we go any further.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.000
And I'm going to check in with you now and you can leave your eyes closed and your hands

45:40.000 --> 45:45.280
where they are, or you can move and adjust. But just tell me a little bit about what you're experiencing.

45:46.240 --> 45:53.600
I'm experiencing a presence that's very familiar.

45:55.440 --> 46:00.320
It's the yeah, yeah guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all bullshit.

46:01.520 --> 46:05.200
Yeah, you know, it's just going to be over soon. This is just a waste of time.

46:06.160 --> 46:14.880
That that that voice that voice and trying to not be put off by its arrogance.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.720
I'm trying to remain open to it.

46:20.000 --> 46:25.680
And there may be an even another part that's put off by its arrogance.

46:25.680 --> 46:28.720
I'm trying to just hold that aside for now. Let's ask it.

46:29.680 --> 46:35.680
Just wait possible. I want to hear it. I want to hear more of this. Yeah, yeah, guy.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.600
Wonderful, John. I can tell that you've practiced.

46:43.200 --> 46:48.720
I have a yeah, yeah, guy too. And he's got a foot on the break.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.560
And then there's another part it sounds like that has a foot on the gas.

46:53.520 --> 47:00.880
And let me just suggest that we turn from the yeah, yeah, yeah guy for a moment

47:01.600 --> 47:04.320
to the part that is a little frustrated with him. Of course.

47:06.240 --> 47:11.840
Can we do that? Can you turn your attention here? And it helps. I was going to ask. It's over here.

47:13.680 --> 47:19.440
But I can sort of feel me. I need the gesture, but I can feel me bringing it sort of center stage.

47:20.320 --> 47:26.240
Wonderful. Now, just take a moment slowly to be with that part.

47:27.200 --> 47:32.240
And the first question I want to ask you, as you notice it, is how do you feel towards it?

47:32.880 --> 47:33.600
Do I feel?

47:35.920 --> 47:42.640
Yeah, I feel it. Oh, there's kind of a blending. It's angry at arrogance. I can't tell that anger

47:42.640 --> 47:45.120
is the parts anger or my anger at the park.

47:45.840 --> 47:51.920
Perfect. So I want you to ask the angry part of you to just take one step back so you can

47:51.920 --> 47:59.680
enter into dialogue with it. Is it willing to do that? Yes. It's going to step sort of over here.

47:59.680 --> 48:07.120
It's not going to go far. It wants to watch. But it's going to yeah. It's it's giving me

48:07.840 --> 48:16.080
a pro temp opportunity. I'll give you a bit of time. Before we pivot, I want you to say thank

48:16.080 --> 48:24.880
you to that part. We want to stay with it. And before we leave it, I want you now to just ask

48:24.880 --> 48:32.880
it a question of how is it here to help you? What is its job? And just notice what it says.

48:33.600 --> 48:40.160
Don't analyze. Just listen. Yeah, it says I'm here to prevent you from

48:40.160 --> 48:41.840
fucking up because of your arrogance.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.840
Thank you. Yeah.

48:50.240 --> 48:57.520
Would it be willing to soften with you if it knows that you're going to turn and deal with

48:58.400 --> 49:00.400
that part so that it doesn't have to?

49:03.520 --> 49:06.960
Would it be willing to trust a little bit? It's there's hesitancy.

49:08.480 --> 49:13.920
But you know, does it make sense to you that it would be hesitant, John?

49:14.960 --> 49:23.120
Yeah. Yeah, it does because there's this part here feels

49:23.280 --> 49:32.400
something tremendous about around arrogance. And this part is saying, you know, that tremendous,

49:32.400 --> 49:40.560
that takes you got to be careful about that. And you got to be very hard and fast reactive.

49:40.560 --> 49:47.600
That's what the anger is for. React hard and fast because this is big, big, big. So that's why it's

49:47.600 --> 49:55.440
like that. But it's it's there's a little bit of I'll give you a bit of time with this. That's

49:55.440 --> 50:03.360
all I can get. Excellent. So thank you. Let's let's make sure we just say thank you. And I would

50:03.360 --> 50:09.520
like to I'll let that part know if I could speak to it. I would say that that's all we need is a

50:09.520 --> 50:17.840
little bit of space. And that I invite it to watch. And I can hear very clearly how important

50:17.840 --> 50:29.520
its role is for protecting John. And if it could just agree to not flood you. For when we're trying

50:29.520 --> 50:34.800
this, I would like to try an agreement that if it needs to get your attention, it would just ask

50:34.800 --> 50:42.480
and not flood you while we're trying. Is that okay? Yeah, that's okay. It's as long as yeah,

50:42.480 --> 50:47.840
as long as I keep my promise. It's still there's doubt, but there's willing there's a bit. Yeah,

50:47.840 --> 50:53.920
of course. Of course, there's doubt. How could there not be? Right. So thank you. I want you to pivot

50:53.920 --> 51:01.280
your attention back to the yeah, yeah, yeah part now. And I want you very right off the bat to just

51:01.280 --> 51:08.800
notice how you feel towards farther away now. Yeah, so you notice a little more distance. And he's

51:08.800 --> 51:14.800
sort of over here, more on the periphery. If I turn to him, he moves a little closer. But

51:16.240 --> 51:23.920
yeah, he's sort of there now. He I don't know, he doesn't seem quite as powerful.

51:24.880 --> 51:33.520
Yeah, so he's his intensity is coming out a bit. He's he's been de-escalated a bit just

51:34.160 --> 51:39.440
just by having some space here. Yeah, I'm now more open to this me.

51:41.520 --> 51:48.480
Yeah, good. Yeah, I do. Yes. Yeah. So could you stay with him? Yeah, yeah, sure. And

51:48.960 --> 51:56.000
and bring some curiosity here, John. I want to listen to him and I want to understand

51:56.560 --> 52:03.360
what it is he's worried about. Could you just ask him in here? That's easy. He's the yeah, yeah,

52:03.360 --> 52:09.200
because right, he wants to dampen things down so we don't have to have all the he wants to make

52:09.200 --> 52:13.840
things boring. So I don't have all the intense emotion of this other stuff. He calls it this

52:13.840 --> 52:21.120
other ship. He's a little bit still. So he's yeah, well, I like him. He's salty. And he's direct.

52:21.120 --> 52:27.440
And he's saying he's saying that he's essentially his job is to protect you from being flooded

52:27.440 --> 52:33.360
by all this intense shit. This stuff. That's what he that's what he means. That's what he

52:33.360 --> 52:41.280
means by bullshit. He means anything that triggers this in some way. Oh, this is great, John.

52:41.840 --> 52:46.720
Can I what I want you to do is kind of like a therapist, reflect that back to him and just

52:46.720 --> 52:53.520
say, do I have it right in your inner voice? Yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, yep, you got it.

52:54.560 --> 53:00.160
Yeah. Okay. Good. How are you feeling towards him now? Kind of fun.

53:02.320 --> 53:08.960
Yeah. Uh huh. You appreciate it, right? I do. Yeah. I used to get annoyed with him because I

53:08.960 --> 53:14.480
felt he was just trivial trivializing things that were important. Oh, he didn't like it when I brought

53:14.480 --> 53:25.840
that up. So now I'm, oh, I want to apologize to him. I want you in your inner voice to notice that

53:25.840 --> 53:34.080
you have some sadness and that you feel for him and let him know as you apologize, let him know

53:34.080 --> 53:40.240
what you feel towards him. Yeah, I'm just letting him know that I didn't treat him fairly. I'm sorry

53:40.240 --> 53:48.720
for that. Yeah. He, uh, and how doing something important. Now I feel, I feel that I feel a little

53:48.720 --> 53:57.680
bit of, I feel regret and a little bit of grief. Yeah. Yeah. Let him know. I am, I am. Yeah.

53:58.560 --> 54:08.320
Yeah. He softens with that. It's like, almost like my grief is a water that's softening things

54:10.240 --> 54:10.800
between us.

54:14.560 --> 54:18.160
I'm going to share something I'd love to hear his response to this.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.440
He hasn't felt an emotional bond with you

54:24.160 --> 54:29.840
in a long time. And to know that his pain affects you and you feel pain

54:31.040 --> 54:39.520
really feels reassuring and comforting to him. Yeah, that lands. There's, yeah, he feels

54:42.960 --> 54:49.120
more trusting is all I'm getting. I can't make it clearer than that. That's right. Yeah. I think

54:49.120 --> 54:54.320
the relationship between the two of you is healing a little bit at that moment where I realized

54:54.320 --> 54:59.600
and it brought up genuine regret, even grief. That was completely unexpected.

55:01.840 --> 55:10.720
Yeah. This is the, the relational component of IFS happening. It's very real. It's very real.

55:10.720 --> 55:17.280
And it is embodied and you felt an emotion and you feeling that emotion for him.

55:17.600 --> 55:25.360
He felt that. And the connection deepened and both of your bodies relaxed. I could see that.

55:25.360 --> 55:31.600
Yeah. It's interesting. He, this is the part where I was talking to you about, about, I don't mean

55:31.600 --> 55:35.920
it abstractly. There's, there's a capacity for self reflection. He's appreciating.

55:38.400 --> 55:43.200
Oh, lovely. He's appreciating the capacity for self reflection.

55:43.360 --> 55:49.040
Yeah. He's sort of, he's, so he's a little bit sorry too.

55:51.360 --> 55:56.000
Hmm. Yeah, I see expressing that. Yeah, that's,

55:57.760 --> 56:00.640
um, this is, we're hugging each other.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.880
Hmm.

56:05.040 --> 56:09.520
It's beautiful John.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.400
Just telling that I'm, I'm telling him I really care for him.

56:16.560 --> 56:20.560
Yeah. That's really beautiful.

56:20.560 --> 56:34.880
He's wrestling with something. There's strong emotion coming up between us and

56:35.840 --> 56:40.160
his grammar, if I can use that language is to try and resist strong emotion. So he's struggling.

56:41.200 --> 56:45.040
Yeah. I'm just, I'm not, I'm just trying to just be with him like you are with a friend who's going

56:45.120 --> 56:48.720
through something. I get the struggle.

56:48.720 --> 56:52.400
Yeah.

56:52.400 --> 57:02.080
Yeah.

57:12.560 --> 57:16.560
I don't want to impinge because I feel like a lot is happening.

57:17.120 --> 57:21.200
Well, he's going through a lot. He's like metabolizing. There's this,

57:21.760 --> 57:24.640
this is this call to integrity. Like it's when the part,

57:27.120 --> 57:34.640
yeah. Yeah. I want to invite you to just stay with him in whatever way you can,

57:34.640 --> 57:37.280
whether that's visually staying close to him.

57:37.280 --> 57:43.520
Yeah. We're just close and he knows that he's allowed to do this.

57:43.520 --> 57:54.720
Good. So there are a couple of questions that you don't have to answer because there's a

57:54.720 --> 58:00.320
connection that's happening that's more important, but you could ask him what he needs from you

58:02.160 --> 58:03.280
and see what he says.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.720
I know it's just stay with him. He says, just be with me.

58:08.800 --> 58:09.200
Good.

58:09.200 --> 58:10.080
Just be with me.

58:10.640 --> 58:11.360
Do you feel you can do that?

58:11.360 --> 58:21.760
Yeah. I mean, it's tricky because I'm finding it hard to find the point of discernment between

58:22.960 --> 58:26.160
empathizing with his pain and bleeding into it.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.960
So a little trouble with the boundary?

58:34.720 --> 58:40.240
I'm afraid that I'm owning something that belongs to him or vice versa.

58:42.160 --> 58:48.720
So, perfect, John. We're not going to leave him. He can stay connected to you,

58:48.720 --> 58:52.160
even if it's just like holding a hand or just staying right by.

58:53.600 --> 58:58.960
But I'd like you to pivot your attention from him to the part of you that's scared

58:58.960 --> 59:03.040
right now. Scared that you're doing it wrong or scared that you're blending.

59:03.040 --> 59:03.920
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

59:04.480 --> 59:08.960
Yeah. That's rational man.

59:09.680 --> 59:09.920
Yeah.

59:11.440 --> 59:15.200
So rational man. Now, same thing as before.

59:15.200 --> 59:20.640
Ask him to take one step back so you can dialogue with him and then take a moment to just take him

59:20.640 --> 59:32.960
in and observe him. What does he want you to see? Just ask him what would you like me to witness

59:32.960 --> 59:34.160
and see what he does?

59:34.160 --> 59:36.640
Well, his initial response is there's not enough theory here.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.920
That's what he initially says, right?

59:40.560 --> 59:44.800
Of course. Of course. So theory is the way he keeps you safe.

59:44.800 --> 59:48.240
It's not enough theory here. This is going off in all these directions.

59:48.240 --> 59:52.240
And he's starting to do this very analytically. He's starting to list.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.920
Yeah. So how do you feel towards this part?

59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.120
I have a friendly relationship with him. That's why when he came up, it was funny.

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:12.320
He does a lot of good work for me. And I'm appreciative. I owe part of my job to him,

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:21.920
right? If he doesn't come into play, I can't do the work I do. So I like him. We like each other.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.280
But he, yeah. But like I said, he's a little...

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:27.760
Can you...

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:38.080
I love the relationship you have and you feel a lot of self-energy with him.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:44.000
It's a very, very good relationship. So I think he's just perhaps wanting to

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.440
touch base and check in with you. Can you ask him if he needs anything from you?

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.000
No. He just said what Seth said.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:00.640
Okay. Great. I love his efficiency. Okay. So if it's okay with him, then we'll turn back to...

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.080
And now I'm not afraid either.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.240
That's the part we were with. Good.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:10.480
There's just... I'm still holding on to him over here. There's still this very localized though,

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:17.920
sort of processing, metabolizing, sort of grief, pain, reunion. That's still running over here.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.240
That's interesting. It almost has a life of its own over here.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.240
Yeah. The relationship continues even if you're not paying attention to it.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.080
That's a great observation, John. So let's check in with him.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.640
And is there anything he wants you to witness now?

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:44.400
He's crying. But he's telling me it's good. It's good. He's actually telling me not to get upset.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.960
Which is interesting.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.000
He's still trying to take care of you.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.880
Yeah. He is. He still cares about me. And that's nice. And I tell him I really get the struggle

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:04.720
he's in. This is the core of who and what he is. His job. It's really clear. His job is to

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:10.480
prevent intense emotion, yet he needs to connect with me. And that has intense emotion attached

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.880
to it. And so he's like, I'm telling you. I'm telling him. Sorry, I switched to talking to

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:24.160
him directly. I get it. I really get it. I get what you're wrestling with. And I'm here. I get it.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.200
So good, John. So good.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:48.640
I'm going to just play a hunch and ask a question. And it could very well be no.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:59.600
But would he be interested in going with you to a safe, secure, different place inside of you?

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.920
Yeah, he doesn't want to do that.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:06.400
He wants to stay where he is. No problem.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.520
He's on the edge of what he can handle.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:20.400
Perfect. So I want to let him know, and you, that we are going to respect his boundaries.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:26.240
And when he feels like he's at a point of saying, stop, that is totally what we're going to do.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.840
All right. I've let him know.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:42.720
Okay. And I'm just going to hold this space with you and allow that to take whatever course it wants

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.680
to take inside.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.080
He's tired.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:05.360
He's processing and bound up. He's tired and got that sense until now. He's really tired.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:17.280
I find myself imagining that he's been great. He wants me to sit down too,

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.680
so I'm sitting down with him. He's really tired.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:25.040
Does it make sense to you that he's tired?

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:31.600
Yeah. He's just been carrying this for a long time and then confronting with this on top of it,

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:39.360
sort of this self-reflective awareness. It's exhausted, really tired.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.320
His job has been exhausting. His job has been exhausting, and he's telling me he's not upset

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:53.920
about it, but getting him to connecting with him is also exhausting. He wants it, but it's exhausting.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.000
So he's been in a bit of a double bind.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:08.960
That's exactly it. Boy, that landed, and he feels like he's struggling. He's been struggling against

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:12.960
that. That makes sense.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.920
Yeah. There's a little bit. I can hear a little bit of intensity in there.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:16.800
His voice.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.200
Powerful for him to have that.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.560
There's this image of almost like, I can't quite draw it with my hands, but there's this

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:35.040
rope, this twisting upon itself rope thing that's binding him and I and himself.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.040
He's trying to articulate it with an image.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.960
That double bind is exactly right.

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.760
Good.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.240
Oh, I feel a lot of compassion for him right now.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.200
He's smiling. What's coming up? When I said that, he smiled.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.720
Oh, some of the negative affect is calming a little bit.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:21.760
Yeah, it continues to calm.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:31.200
Sort of settling in. He just wants to be with me, very calm and just be with me without all that

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.400
without all that craziness.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:49.040
What I'm getting, John, is that maybe for the first time, it feels safe for him to be connected

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:54.000
with you and to not be scared of getting flooded by all the intense stuff.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:07:03.520
Yeah, there's a bit of a sense of confidence. You said that it was the negative affect grows

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:17.440
a little bit, but it didn't go. It just went and it sort of hit that confidence that shared faith.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.040
He likes that. He likes me saying that.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:38.960
One of the things that is done in the IFS world is to, if possible, if he wants to,

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:50.720
where there was all that angst and fear and intensity, a space might clear in him

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.720
where he could take in calmness and confidence

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.120
and breathe that in and feel it. He wants to get up and move around a little bit.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:06.880
Wonderful. He's sort of dancing.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.280
It still hurts a little, but he's dancing.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:26.400
Breathing in creativity and expression. He's returning.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.720
He wonders what's next.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.240
He's returning to play. Now that he's free of the job he wasn't supposed to have,

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:49.840
he can become embodied as a natural being that has its own organic nuclear agenda.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:51.920
What does he want?

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.960
Well, I had to hold Rational Man off for a sec. He came in.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.480
Sorry. I think I brought him in.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.600
This needs a label. This needs a name. We've got to put some concepts on this.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:06.960
I'll give you time later.

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:13.840
That's exactly right. He's going to come and get his turn in a minute.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:23.200
He did. Like I said, he and I have a very good working relationship.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.760
When he stepped back, again, even more calmness here,

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:39.280
he's considering, I don't know how to put this, so this isn't quite right, but

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.600
he's considering just putting down his job.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.400
He's really open question. Is that possible?

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:51.840
Yeah.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.480
So he's contemplating it.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.400
I said, I think it is. I'd like to help.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:15.280
Yeah, he's really, he's in that state of, huh, that's what he keeps sort of doing,

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.880
huh, maybe, and he's still dancing around too.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.080
He dances and he pauses and he does that, huh, he does that, huh.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.280
He's feeling into it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.080
Yeah, he doesn't want to rush, that's for sure.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.160
Well, that makes sense to me.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.680
Yeah, me too. Me too.

01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.280
Yeah.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:57.920
I just, you wanted me to forgive him. I do it. Get it.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.080
Yeah. Okay.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.120
Okay.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.440
He really needed to hear that.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:53.280
Yeah, as he's considering the possibility, he's sort of sharing with me, see all the places in your

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.680
life where I was this trivializing thing.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.760
He wants to make sure that I'm fully appreciating his job, what he's been doing.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:12.480
And he's wondering if I, yep, that's so important.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.440
He's wondering if I can

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.080
really accept that and forgive him to that scale.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.880
Yeah, I really can get it.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:44.880
Well, he believes me, but he's still not fully settled.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.480
Now he's sitting down again. He wants to sit with all of this.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:04.960
Are we getting a thing from him? That's enough for me. I don't want to do any more.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.200
Yeah.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:14.960
Well, he has done an amazing amount of work right now. Yeah, I mean, really amazing.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:25.520
Um, this is a point where we can just remind him that you're not going anywhere.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.400
And that he can reach you when it's on the door.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:37.280
That's it. And we want to make sure we're clear about how we can connect with you if you need to.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:44.400
Through your body, through emotion, but through words would be great too.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.280
Yeah, I'm letting him know.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:49.840
Good.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:59.120
So he's asking if I can just leave that little bit of energy running for him

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.920
so he can keep processing it. I said, that's fine.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:10.320
Wonderful. And just, um, if it feels right to you, John, you could let him know that you'll

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.960
check back in with him later. I will. I'll check back in with you.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:14.000
Okay.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:15.920
You're doing.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:24.160
And, um, you can say your goodbyes in whatever way you want to. And then when you're ready, come on back here.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:43.120
There's, well, I've always found it powerful. That was very powerful. It, uh,

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.400
your expertise, your virtuosity was helpful. You often said something that

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.600
landed just beyond where I was, but landed well. And that was very helpful.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:06.640
Good. It was pretty easy on my side too. In fact, the hardest part was just restraining myself,

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.680
because the work was going so quickly. And your system, I would say your system was

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.760
very ready to do that. So at the very end,

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.280
I had a sense of Hermes, almost like a translucent presence,

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.160
surrounding the whole thing, sort of saying, well done.

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.240
That was unexpected too. That just came.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:36.800
Yeah.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:48.640
John, thank you for your trust and, um, for allowing me to be with you.

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:49.040
Thank you.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:56.480
Um, I'd like to take the opportunity to let rational man have his, uh, his time,

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.960
because there is a lot of sense making that could be powerful here.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.840
But I don't want to do that at the expense of, um, the connection that you just established,

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.280
and the experience you're having in your body right now.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.880
So maybe we start with just checking in on how you feel.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:23.280
So I, really, really good. And then right here, this little tiny sort of running that's happening,

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:28.640
and it's him, uh, it's not, it's not pleasant, but it's not distressing to me because,

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.600
yeah, there's a moment of sort of friendship there. I could feel this is just the metabolizing

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.320
going on. Just metabolizing. You just keep checking in with me. And yep, I will. I will.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.240
Uh-huh. That's great. That's great. It's, um,

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:53.840
I love your interception. So, um, well, you, you have, uh, really developed your ability to

01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:57.120
stay relational and dialogical and present. Learned it from,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.440
and embodied. Learned it from socrates, so.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:03.840
Pretty good teacher.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.960
Um, so I want to, um, take the risk and you tell me and interrupt me at any point if it

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:21.200
feels like, um, it's not going intuitively where you would like to be. Um, but I'd like to draw some

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:26.960
things out, uh, that we've been talking about, um, that, that I just witnessed, I think.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:37.280
So the first thing I want to do is say that, um, uh, we encountered, uh, a couple of different

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:46.720
parts in there. Um, a rational man clearly is a manager, um, who is in charge of keeping things

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:56.400
safe. Um, and we also had this frustrated part that I think is a manager that, uh, seems to be, um,

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:05.760
also charged with keeping things safe. Um, and I think, I think we had a bit of a firefighter

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:14.080
there in the, uh, the bullshit detector who, um, both was trying to keep, in a manager way,

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:20.880
trying to keep you from being flooded, but also responding to the flood when it would happen

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.760
by kind of trying to cut it off and call it out. Um, and what happened is as, as you brought

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:32.960
what Schwarz calls self energy, which we, we first had to clear other problems, right?

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:40.000
We had to, we had to get them to give you space so that you could be with him. And people will

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.880
have noticed as soon as they gave space, we didn't have to do anything. You turned back

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.760
and the relationship field had changed. He wasn't flooding you and super close. He was a little

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:59.120
further. Your system was deactivated and you were present and curious. And the relationship

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.440
dynamics just took hold. And I would say this is where, from my perspective as an EFT therapist

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:12.640
and an attachment based psychotherapist, we watched a beautiful scene of attachment unfold

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:21.440
where it was nervous system to nervous system. And so what I was trying to draw out was that

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:28.560
connection that you felt emotionally to him. And I wanted him to see it and feel that your system

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:36.720
was connected to his. He felt pain. You felt sad about it. Yeah. And there's a natural. So

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:42.400
when we work with couples, primary affect, when it comes up, when I see my partner who I love and

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:48.640
my whole world depends on hurting, some kind of fear comes up in me and I want to make it better.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.600
And I feel sad that they're in pain. That is trustworthy because that can't lie. That can't

01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:03.120
be untrue. You can't have those automatic responses be feigned. And so that gave him an

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.400
opportunity to experience something that is truly trustworthy between the two of you.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:20.560
And he began to soften. And as he softened, we had grief. But we also had the possibility of

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:26.960
something new emerging. And I agree with everything you said. But there's that there was and I wasn't

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:35.040
imposing it. There's that there's a Socratic aspect of him coming to try to live by the principle.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:40.160
Like that's when he got into the double bind. That's a Socratic Aporia. Right. And he got into

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:48.320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there was a ah, right. And that was that was I thought, I thought really important

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:54.960
too. And the part of me that didn't want to do to I like part of what I've been learning in my

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.160
practice is to stay with Aporia rather than try to and that's rational man coming in to try let's

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:06.640
get this come on. Like, and no, let's hold that back. Stay with the Aporia really stay with the

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.240
Aporia. Give it some autonomy, let it unfold as it needs to.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:18.160
Or in this case, what I heard was he began to try to work with a symbol. Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:26.000
And that something needed to loosen and and kind of become

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.840
untied. I think he came to the possibility that emotions

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:39.200
are not inherently dangerous. It was that's that kind of realization and that he actually wanted

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:46.080
an emotional connection with me. And he was really I mean, yeah, so that is

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:53.120
No, no, no, please. For me, that was that was like that was a real that felt like a profound moment

01:21:53.120 --> 01:22:00.800
because it was him like getting it. Like he was like it's like the existential confront.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:07.360
He was confronted by, you know, a kind of inner contradiction. Like, no, no, I want an emotion

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:14.880
and it's not so it can't be that they're inherently bad. But my job is to dampen down

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:24.640
emotion. And that was the knot. And I felt that that and I found I'm, I'm, I'm surmising because

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:29.840
now we're doing theoretical reflection that my practice in dialectic of theologos of being

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.880
apophatic and staying with Aporia came in to help me there because it helped me also keep

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.480
rational man over there. And it helped me, okay, you need to I can't unravel this for you.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:46.400
Right. But I can be here with you and say I'm going to support you and empathize with you as

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.080
you try to do, even as I'm saying that right now, this is getting calmer.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:23:02.720
So in IFS, we'd say that's self-energy. That compassion, curiosity, courage, creativity,

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:05.440
calmness connected. That's the socratic spirit for me.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.960
Well, and there are five, I always forget there are five P's as well as the eight C's. And I wrote

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:22.640
them down here. Patience, perspective, which I think is a lot of this, presence, persistence,

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:31.760
no, no, no, rational man, you know, playfulness. This is all, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think this

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.760
self-energy can be helped by people if they have a practice of internalizing a sage. I think that

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:46.240
would help concretize it so they can enact it better. So this is, this is the guide idea and

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:53.920
that your attachment with Hermes, not a coincidence that appears at the end as he is,

01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:00.960
he's blessed. Very much. That was, that's the word. And that's the word. Exactly.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:05.840
I feel a bit of happy right now.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.120
Lovely.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.840
Can I just, one thing that I really want to kind of draw out here is we talked about parts having

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:29.360
attachment styles. And I heard, primarily I heard in it, an anxious attachment style that

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:39.600
and the, the, oh, oh, was his dropping into security. Maybe for the first time.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:46.240
I love this. I love the IFF and the attachment. I mean the EFT and the attachment. That's, oh,

01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:53.520
it's so good. But John, listen to this. This is the definition in my mind of secure attachment

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.160
is about the ability to process emotion. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that emotion,

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:04.000
emotion is not a threat. It's data. Yeah, it's data. And you and he were learning to interpret

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.720
the data together. That it is not flooding, but it can be, I can actually feel it and use it

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:16.240
and symbolize it, feel it in the body, symbolize it in a way it can be understood,

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:22.640
be responded to, feel regulated, four steps to attach. That was beautiful. Feel it,

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:32.560
symbolize it often in language. Be responded to accurately in a way that works. Be soothed.

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:39.440
That repeated creates a secure attachment style. And that's what you were doing with it. Yeah.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.480
He'd never done it, John. No, of course not. He'd never done it. Of course he had, right.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:54.880
But you got, and we got to witness the transformation that like that kind of presence and love,

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.800
really. That brings sadness to me.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.800
Did he never felt it? No. And we're, it's almost a sharing. I have,

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.160
I think my attachment style as John is one of anxious attachment. And that has caused me

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:23.280
a tremendous amount of loss and suffering and put relationships at risk. So that just came back to

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:35.200
me very powerfully. Of course. So I feel for him even more, but it brings up that sort of anxious

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:43.600
empathy around, yeah, I know how bad this could be. It also makes sense to me when you say that,

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:52.000
why he would be so curious and scared about your ability to forgive him. Exactly. That's exactly

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:57.600
right. That's exactly right. He knows it's cost you. Yeah.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.280
Now that lands very deeply, very deeply right here.

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.680
But it's not his fault. No. Yeah, he gets that.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:23.920
And this is why IFS represents one of the best technologies that we have in our endeavors

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:34.160
of dealing with the meeting crisis. And it's very exciting.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:43.440
This idea of creating or not creating, sorry, accessing self-energy.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:49.360
I use inventio. I use inventio, imaginal inventio. You're discovering and making,

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.440
and it's a mixture. It's inventio because it's transjective. It can't be either discovery or

01:27:53.440 --> 01:28:01.680
making. It has to be inventio and it's imaginal. And in your experience, we have an even fuller

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:10.320
demonstration with Hermes coming as a transjective object that he brings the eight C's and the five

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:17.760
P's into the system in a way that maybe you couldn't access before. And that's the larger

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:25.120
self, kind of the, he's creating this bridge. I was going to say, I didn't, I didn't, I make a

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:31.360
difference between asking something from him and invoking his presence. I didn't invoke his

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.960
presence because I wanted to, and so I didn't do that, but I asked for his help in the practice

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.920
that I could come into it as authentically as possible.

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:45.520
And you did? Yeah.

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:52.960
I experienced Hermes as holding space there. That's where he was. And that's where he was in

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.440
the final image. He's like, there's, I don't know why there's sort of a hillside behind,

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:05.200
and he's on like, and it's that translucent figure. Yeah, very much. I didn't, I, yeah,

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.160
I didn't get that until you said it, but the translucency was a way of presencing the

01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:19.360
transjectivity. Excellent. Excellent observation set. Ah, I love that. I love that. Yeah. Yeah,

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:25.920
the psychopomp, the movement through that he embodies a kind of liminal transitionality.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:31.360
What was wonderful about that presencing is often when I'm working with him, we have to sort of

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:37.120
scrape away automatic projections going on to him, given to me by my fundamentalist past.

01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.000
That wasn't there at all. This is one of the, this was like pure presence, and it was quite

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.960
wonderful, quite wonderful, beautiful, even sublime.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:58.320
I think I'd point out one other thing that is really important, and that is that there was

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:04.800
such a strong relational element to the work between you and I, as we did this, and that

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:13.840
that was not work that, you know, you were doing by yourself, but it was in dialogue going this way,

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:21.920
and going internal, and maybe going this way hermetically. And I think that creates

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:27.600
a picture of safety that we can reference when we, we talk about encountering the

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:34.880
numinous as a way of kind of accessing wisdom, that it is, it is connected in all these directions.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:46.000
And that feels, it feels like the container, you know, that's needed. Yeah. Yeah. That's

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:51.120
landing very deeply for me. And for me, I see it as containers within containers. This is the

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:59.360
container. And then it sits into a larger 4e neoplatonic framework. And like, yeah, there's

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:04.880
there's these nestings. And but they're not ossified and hard. They're like, they're like

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:07.520
cellular membranes. So

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:20.160
I had one other question for you about how old was he? He was a 25 to 30 year old man.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.960
Okay, interesting. He got a little bit younger as the practice went on.

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:37.200
I was wondering about that because he had exile qualities. And we haven't talked about

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:45.440
exiles, but he was clearly carrying a lot of pain and exhaustion, guilt and anger and sadness,

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:54.080
a lot of like, the anxious attachment stuff that he began to release in his way.

01:31:54.080 --> 01:32:00.720
It was interesting. I kind of wanted to go that way as John. But no, that was not,

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:05.280
that wasn't going to happen. That was not going to happen. He was, that's not,

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:12.640
it was, he needed, he needed to dwell. That's the word I was looking for. He needed to dwell here

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:24.480
for a while. I mean, reminds me dwelling at home. He needed to feel at home. Yeah.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:34.720
Well, I know like 1115 was our hard stop or 1215 year time. You normally give me the last word,

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:40.000
but I'm wondering if you would like it. Yeah, let's break with that tradition just for this one

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:48.800
time. First of all, thank you for that. And I think the integrity of the practice as a container

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:56.480
and as a vehicle is both a container and a vehicle. I think that was apparent. It was

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:04.640
spontaneously there. I didn't have to force it. It had, it was Dow. It wasn't, right? And

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:11.120
it's important to,

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:22.880
important to share this responsibly. I agree with you. And all these

01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:29.040
dialogical practices, I think, well, we'll talk about, I want to talk about them now.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:36.800
I want to talk about the next one. What does that mean? Because I think they push on deeper frameworks

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.760
and, right? That's why I talked about the 4E and the cognitive, 40 cognitive science and

01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:48.880
neoplatism because we're really challenging the buffered self. And I think, I think, and I don't

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.520
know how this works. So this is a question. I don't, I want to know how these, I'll use

01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.480
a, a convoluted thing. I don't know how these cultural spirits interact with these psychological

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:08.000
parts. Like we've got inculturation towards the buffered self and we get social reinforcement

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.840
and salience incentivizing around it. And that's a deeply internalized machine that it's almost

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:21.040
transparent. And I think in practice, we, we press up against that when we're doing these

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:29.600
kinds of practices. But for me, I feel especially because I bring this whole framework of reflectively

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:37.520
trying to philosophically trying to challenge the monadic, monophasic, monological, monostage self

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:46.640
that it's, it's, it's very amplified for me. That sense, that deeper sense of what is it like?

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:53.920
And that didn't come up here because there was enough. But it's coming up now as I step back

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:57.120
from it. It's like, as it's percolating through my psyche, it's like, yeah, but

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:04.320
like, what is it to challenge that cultural spirit and challenge it in a way that integrates with

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:07.520
what's happening with these psychological parts? That's a question that I have.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:20.640
So what I'd reflect is I feel like rational man. And is now, you know, we talk about, I think the

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:31.120
theme for today was that the imaginal is crucial to being rational. And he's picking it up. I feel

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:39.600
like this, this practice you just engaged in has clarified something for him that he now has

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.720
sharper questions. I think that's exactly right. I think that's exactly right.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:51.200
Okay, Mike. Yeah, that's something. Thank you for all of this. And we'll set up another,

01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:58.000
another episode because I do want to explore some of these themes around danger and framework

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000
and cultural spirit versus psychological part. If I could just coin those terms as

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.880
the whole two things conceptually different for a while. Oh, yeah. And so I invite you to come back

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:16.960
for a fourth episode. Well, I tell you, yeah, I thank you. And I would love to.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.400
It's, it's wonderful to dialogue with you. And it's a gift. And I'm very excited if you choose

01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:37.280
to share it. I'm going to upload this. Wonderful. I know this may seem like a very shame less or

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:45.520
shameful plug. But because the spirit of this is to, you know, promote these practices,

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:53.600
we are going to offer the attachment workshop and the IFS workshop again through the foundation.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.680
Coming up in April and May. Yeah, please. Everybody, you see what this can do. Okay. So,

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:06.080
you know, you've got an amazing opportunity with Seth. Please make use of it. I'm going to end

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:13.680
the recording here, Seth. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jeff.
