1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Welcome everyone to uh, I've really been looking forward to this voices with revaking I'm going to be talking with and I'm introducing you to Elizabeth O'Fields she had me on her show on the sacred and I had such a wonderful

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Personally powerful interview and discussion with her she really drew me out in a powerful way we got into some very deep stuff and I was very moved by it and I've seen her on a couple other videos

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Conversations very impressed I asked Elizabeth for two things to gifts to send me a copy of her book and to come back on my show and talk about it. The book we're going to be talking about is her wonderful book fully alive

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Which is a very interesting it's very Augustinian it's a mix of a kind of autobiographical confession and psycho spiritual theological reflection and so I'm putting you there in some very August company

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:04,000
August company literally August company so yes and I'm going to introduce Elizabeth in a sec and let her tell her a little bit about herself and what I thought we do and I proposed Elizabeth is

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to pick out some parts of her book that really sank to me really resonated either like they called to me deeply or they provoked a question in me and the intent is all say how

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What it evoked or provoked in me share that with Elizabeth give her a chance to respond reflect and hopefully we'll get into a good flowing dialogue us and so that's the intent but first Elizabeth great welcome very much appreciate you coming

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And why don't you just say a little bit about yourself we're going to get into some of you because your book is autobiographical but maybe just a little bit of framing you think might be helpful for some of my listeners who haven't met you before

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Gosh how does one describe themselves well I am speaking to you from a very small and I've realized right in this book that the phrase intentional community is more jargon than I realized that it is that doesn't actually make a lot of sense to everybody so I'm using the phrase micro monastery a small community of families that live together and drawing on monastic rhythms in South London in the UK and

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think the thread of my life has been being really interested in these questions of what is a good life how do we live together well how do we learn to love each other more.

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And what are the stories that culture is telling us that make that easier easier or harder.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And theological questions have been woven through that I've been in and out of faith and in all different kind of flavors and but those are my those are my.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Abiding questions what does it mean to really live what does it mean to grow in love what does it mean to connect with each other and have all done all kinds of jobs related to that but that's the kind of underground river.

14
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Well thank you that's very very helpful so I guess as I said I want to just pick up on a few things and I want to pick up on.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I guess the first thing and that really struck me is and I found kind of a simpatico between us is you you say at one point so many people I speak to and I think it you mean when you were writing or when you were doing your show.

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So many people I speak to create places to belong and ways to settle their soul and I thought wow that's because for me how that resonated with me is the sense of belonging the sense of connectedness meaning in life relevance realization I do a lot of work on that.

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then also this idea of you know getting the various elements of the psyche levels kinds of knowing a line is very platonic right inner justice outer connections reality and they're reinforcing each other so that's what landed with me.

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I wonder how what I just said lands with you is that was that something you were noticing in general that people are seeking.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean Plato proposed that there is the sort of two metadrives we want this kind of inner fullness piece and we want this fullness of contact and not just an intellectual we want to belong in some way.

20
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you think what what what comes up for you when I say that.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes that's beautiful my knowledge of philosophy is patchy at best and so the main thing is allowing to learn more and to understand the different the ways different wisdom traditions use language.

22
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That often feel like they're trying to get to something similar right something unspeakable something beyond language but certainly the the thread that I've been pulling on is what does it mean.

23
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I used the phrase to someone recently and honestly as soon as I said it was like oh that sounds so smug.

24
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But that we were talking about psychedelics and the psychedelics renaissance and what that might mean and the way it's changing the spiritual landscape and she said have you have you ever been tempted and I said well sure in a like curious way.

25
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But I don't feel a need because I have a deep sense of existential satisfaction and then I was like that's like check your existential satisfaction privilege.

26
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's true like I need to be honest about that.

27
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I wonder if that like internal coherence.

28
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That you use this lovely thing about different parts of our psyche lining up that actually the very deepest part of ourselves are very I sometimes think of them as our very deepest values the things we want to define our lives.

29
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are conscious of them for one thing.

30
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then we are making choices around them we are seeking to stay loyal to them rather than just sitting there thinking actually I'm not living the life I wanted to I'm not staying I'm not paying attention to myself I'm not staying loyal to my values.

31
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I'd love to I'd love to hear more I'm really interested in the way most wisdom traditions seem to.

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Have reached for language to indicate that there are different parts of us right you might think of the ego and the it's super ego my tradition it's the flesh and the spirit of the you know there's actually broken up in different ways and different parts of scripture and different parts of my tradition.

33
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is that what Plato is grasping towards do you think there.

34
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well there's there's there's two different I mean because Plato there isn't one Plato just like there's not one voice in the Bible right so one of the great mistakes that was predominant in academic philosophy philosophy and research on Plato with for a long time that has now been pretty much overturned was this idea that there's a single voice of Plato and we can get a single

35
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:41,000
theory theory out of that single voice and we've largely come to realize no that's not how his philosophy works but to to them are and this one really prefigures Freud in major ways there's sort of three centers in us.

36
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
There's one you could call he calls it a monster that's sort of in your abdomen in your genitalia and it works in terms of super salient very present it's in the present moment super salient it's very urgent it works in terms of.

37
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Appetites and drives.

38
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah yes and then you have this thing that's there's no real good translation for it I'm sort of touching my heart area but when I say heart all kinds of romanticism rolls in that's not important or relevant or even important.

39
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So I'm going to the Greek word.

40
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's kind of where our sociocultural emotions are how we want to be connected to other people recognized and values by others is where we have things like pride and shame and admiration and envy that so it's working at this sort of social connectedness level.

41
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then there's this and he represents that with a lion lion hearted and where we get you know courage and lions are social animals and then forgive the sexism but compared to a lot of people played it was you know very far ahead he actually said women could be philosophers they could be in the army they could be governed they could be rulers of the state.

42
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Right but there's a man in your head and they that man can pursue long term abstract goals and they work in terms of true he works in terms of truth and falsity and then he talks about.

43
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right so they're working at these different scales and they have different goals and his point which is I think very well I think he develops better than Freud in some ways because he talks about the cognitive dimensions of these things.

44
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Is that each one of these has got pretty good sort of psychological cognitive scientific evidence for it that we have these different kinds of motivations.

45
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And then his point is they often come in conflict with each other because they're working according to different criteria and at different scales and then what part of it is to be wise.

46
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is to figure out the optimal relation each one seeks to be maximal but the degree to which it's maximal it damages the other two right and so you have to get a way of getting them all working as optimally together and that's a fullness of life because then everything is being as fully as live to use your phrase as possibly can.

47
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And if you give me one more minute and then the idea is that inner conflict is the driver and this is where it overlaps with Freud of a lot of.

48
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Our self deception of a lot of our projection our defensiveness our neurosis and right and as we ameliorate that inner conflict we start to cleanse the doors of perception and see more deeply into reality.

49
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
As we see more deeply into reality we get better at seeing more deeply into reality and then we can more better realize the real patterns of the psyche.

50
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We can align the psyche better we can then see more deeply into reality and this is the ascent out of the cave this rolling reciprocal opening that's going on.

51
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's the and Plato's idea is that is the way to mutually satisfy our two meta drives.

52
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Our two meta drives are in addition to whatever satisfies our desire we want the satisfaction of our desire to not create inner conflict and undermine our agency.

53
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We want it to lead to a piece of fullness.

54
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And in addition to whatever satisfies our desires we want what satisfies our desires to be real not fake not an illusion not a fraud.

55
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And when we can mix though when we get those two together we get that sense of inner peace and connectedness to what's most real.

56
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And that's his proposal for human happiness.

57
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.

58
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to go away and chew on it.

59
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sorry I didn't know I didn't want to get it.

60
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No it's really helpful because it.

61
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The the sort of working thesis I have about sin and again this is pretty personal.

62
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just ponderings allowed rather rather than and well he and in the book I'm not claiming a kind of.

63
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Closed thesis or.

64
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You know one of the things I had to liberate myself actually from in order to be able to write was this desire that in a thing you say in this deep area you have to be completely certain of and you need to approach in this very academic fashion and liberate

65
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
liberating myself honestly to sort of in play to his language to draw on wisdom from all of those right and to say particularly this bit for me.

66
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Connection is everything fully alive.

67
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is everything relationship is everything and it's not that he's completely abandoned you know reason or the man in our head or or or whatever but that the primacy of that post enlightenment post reformation the way.

68
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The way we have.

69
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Disconnected we have made wisdom subsumed under knowledge.

70
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And scripture is my scriptures are incredibly clear that wisdom is not the same thing as knowledge that you can learn a bunch of facts.

71
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And it puffs you up.

72
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Wisdom builds you and other people up.

73
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And so my kind of getting to the point of thinking what do what do I think is getting in the way of my fully aliveness and the fully aliveness in the world.

74
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why do we do what we do not want to do and not do what we do not want what we do want to do.

75
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why can we not tackle the climate crisis.

76
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why do we not seem to be able to live together well.

77
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Why is tribalism polarization exploding.

78
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What is it about humans.

79
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right.

80
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Given we are so beautiful and so tender and have so much potential for glory and goodness.

81
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What are we doing.

82
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And that deep sense of actually the tradition that was in the background in my childhood and that I had rejected once that says that's a sin that this is what's tripping us up.

83
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And I was like sin.

84
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

85
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's unfashionable.

86
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well I don't care.

87
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think you're saying something really important.

88
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
First of all I agree wholeheartedly with the distinction between knowledge and wisdom.

89
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Knowledge is about overcoming ignorance.

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wisdom is over about overcoming foolishness and those are different things.

91
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Ignorance is a lack of knowledge.

92
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Foolishness is a failure to grasp the proper significance of what you know and apply it appropriately.

93
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Live it.

94
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes exactly.

95
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And that's when talking about different kinds of knowing and getting them aligned could be important.

96
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But let's not get into that right now.

97
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I see.

98
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So I once proposed this definition and I was trying to create a bridge and I don't know.

99
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't think it succeeded because I don't think anybody got it or they didn't seem to pick up on it.

100
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I'm going to try again.

101
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sorry.

102
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was trying to bridge between the theological language and this philosophical language around foolishness where foolishness isn't just you do this thing.

103
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No it's more like this system of self deception that takes on a life of its own.

104
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And one of the papers I published with Leo Ferraro we called it parasitic processing.

105
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's this kind of thing that takes you over and narrows you down and narrows you and flattens your world and you get sort of locked in.

106
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Very much like the machinery that my friend Mark Lewis talks about with addiction.

107
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You know your cognitive flexibility and your sense of who you could be diminishes and the world shrinks and they reciprocally narrow which is the opposite.

108
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And here's the connection with love because love is reciprocally opening right.

109
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And so I said I think and so if you can get to this notion of foolishness is kind of anti love.

110
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I said I wonder if we could understand sin as a failure to love wisely.

111
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I wonder what you think of that as a proposal as I know it's very Augustinian but if you object I'm happy to hear but what do you think about that.

112
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I in my current working ponderings love and sin are opposites.

113
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And so for me fully alive this is connection is moving towards life moving towards our own soul moving towards each other moving towards the earth actually and moving towards the divine.

114
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

115
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And it's the withdrawal and the disconnection that is the sort of blanket category for sin.

116
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Luther and Augustin use this phrase homo incanvatis in say I don't know.

117
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No one knows how you pronounce that.

118
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Man or humanity turned in on ourselves and the sense of an in growing toenail.

119
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And so the idea that love that sin is love not applied wisely or foolishly.

120
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'd have to sit with that a little bit I think it for me for me.

121
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I haven't given much thought to foolishness but what you're making me think about foolishness is it's a real category in the book of Proverbs spoken about a lot.

122
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The wise man and the foolish man and the wife man and the foolish man and some of that.

123
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Jesus does too.

124
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yeah.

125
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I guess for me the sort of outworkings of what I've been grasping towards is that foolishness is a failure to understand that life is connection.

126
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That love is what draws us that love is what defines us and pride as the sort of kings in is the idea that we can manage without it.

127
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That we can manage without other people that we are not relational that we're not interconnected that actually we are the solipsistic autonomous self actualizing self creating.

128
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So maybe there is some overlap because that's a withdrawal from love.

129
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I think so.

130
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What I heard when you were doing the in grown toenail is very much what.

131
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:20,000
First of all let's get the idea that the self is not a monad that the self is not an Aristotelian substance independently existing possessing its properties and being the sole author of its business.

132
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's go to 40 cogs and say the self is inherently dialogical.

133
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's inherently relational.

134
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And then that inward turning is what we were trying to get at with this notion of reciprocal narrowing.

135
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right.

136
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where I I'm I'm not I'm less and less tapping into the depth of myself and less and less opening tapping into the depth of the other.

137
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And that seems to mean like the hardening of the heart.

138
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes.

139
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah.

140
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Right.

141
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And to me I was I was trying to get at the idea that when we're not loving wisely we're we have chosen to go into reciprocal narrowing and harden our heart.

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And the heart is what we're behind as we engage in the bullshit pretense of being autonomous substances completely self making and self interpreting.

143
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That that was what I was trying to get at.

144
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

145
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

146
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I think that's brilliant.

147
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I love that language of of patterns because I'm obsessed with formation.

148
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This this you know the this interconnects with the way McGill Chris work about attention and the and I was the the hardening the heart thing came up for me because I was talking to someone about what is going on with these people having very spiritual experience on psychedelics and what is the role of attention and what is it.

149
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That means that I feel.

150
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Able to have what certainly seemed to be experiences of the divine in a ways that people with a different temperament formation history than we find would long for but find really difficult.

151
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes.

152
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes.

153
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And whether these types of attention.

154
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Can yeah that they shape what we can see right they shape what's possible for us they should and that that that what did you call it reciprocal narrowing.

155
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The reciprocal opening.

156
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yeah.

157
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah.

158
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And that when we've tried when we try and live in ways practices and rituals and themes and communities crucially communities that mean that our formation is towards love.

159
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
We will increasingly open to the world and open to reality and open to each other.

160
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And now I want to read that paper.

161
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay.

162
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Thank you.

163
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you.

164
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So so that notion of connectedness I mean this is what I do a lot of my actual scientific work on.

165
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So the core of one of my central theses is that general intelligence the kind of intelligence we demonstrate and the kind that they're trying to make with artificial general intelligence at the core of it is this ability.

166
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's two things interlocked anticipation the more you can sort of anticipate the future the more intelligent we the more intelligence we attribute an organism.

167
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But interlock with that is Mike the core problem which is relevance realization there's so much there's so much information available it's astronaut astronomically vast.

168
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There's so much information in your memory and all the ways you could combine it there's so many different sequences of behavior sounds you could utter.

169
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
There's so many logical possibilities you could consider and the thing that you do and this is kind of like the Zen Cohen is your intelligent by ignoring almost all of that information.

170
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But you don't ignore it randomly because if you ignore it randomly you to have an astronomical chance of doing the wrong thing somehow you zero in on the relevant information.

171
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And here's the thing relevance isn't in me and relevance isn't in the object it's how the object and I are fitted together how we belong together for a certain task.

172
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And it's not cold calculation because it's what's grabbing my attention it's what's arousing my affect it's what's committing my agency and so it's always bound up with care.

173
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So relevance realization is this is this homing and notice the word I'm using homing in on something a deep connectedness a deep caring a deep evolving involvement and I use the I use the Latin word religio to talk about that sense of connectedness.

174
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And then that's the first thesis and I won't give you all the arguments and evidence for that I've been doing that for like, I don't know, 25 years making that argument, tons of publications and other people publishing on that and all that so I'm just going to take that.

175
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And so, I think that's the core of our agency as intelligent beings, and I think it also plays a significant role in consciousness, we could get back to that if you wish.

176
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But then here's the second proposal that that religio that sense of connectedness.

177
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So that's coming out of the part of psychology that studying intelligence one of the problems in psychology is the different parts don't talk to each other. That's why I'm a cognitive scientist.

178
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And then you have two other streams. You have people doing meaning in life and people doing the psychology of belonging like Kelly Allen.

179
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Here's my proposal that what the psychologists are talking about and measuring when they're measuring meaning in life is they're measuring that that how much people have a celebrated sense of religio of connectedness that is deeply relevant to them and affords them

180
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:25,000
solving problems and in and using your language forming their identity and their agency. And that's also what people are talking about in that sense of belonging in the belonging literature and then if you don't have a sense of belonging, you're in trouble psychologically

181
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:38,000
social socially, even physiologically. And I think all three of these converge on this sense of religio and that sense of connectedness.

182
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And the way you can sort of test for meaning in life. I think you and I might have talked about this is you can ask people three questions. What do they want to exist even if they don't.

183
00:21:48,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How real is it and how much of a difference do they make to it right now. The more answers you have to those questions and the deeper you think your answers are, the more I will predict you say your life has meaning in life.

184
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What do you think about that is trying to unpack this, because you do you and wonderfully so you keep coming back this sense of connectedness, this movement towards an opening up to but also letting other letting the world and letting other people into one

185
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:40,000
like this seems to me to be exactly what you're talking about. And this scientific literature would plug into that. I think I mean it just it makes so much sense to me on such a deep level and it is essentially what I think most of theology is about which makes sense.

186
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If you believe that we are made in the image of a God who is relationship in and of God self right if you believe in the Trinity.

187
00:22:48,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, I want to talk to you about that. We're going to talk about that. That's great. I think the other the other real thread that I pull on a lot is Martin Buber and I thou and the phrase that he uses about when we see and I say two thirds of I thou the very short

188
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
is about moments between us and other people and the last third is about moments between us and the divine us and God, but it.

189
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He says the moments of religio you could I think replace me when we turn and other people stop to stop being objects to us or symbols or ciphers or just collections of pre like pattern recognition predictions what we already know about them, you know we put out into the world and we don't really need to take the cognitive

190
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:43,000
time to we just people do what you expect them to do the moments we cut through that and we really see them and we see them as a you and we were taking a new information we were seeing them.

191
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That is all that is really real.

192
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That is that that is living that is life that is fully aliveness that is that's it that's that's everything that's the game and he and another book of his he writes about how we spend a huge amount of time in different disciplines thinking about the individual self which

193
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:11,000
neither you or I really believe in but you know on all different disciplines health and psychology and sociology and politics and then we spend a lot of time thinking about ourselves as groups as like.

194
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know sociology how do groups work how do they integrate how do we define but there's a third category which is the between yes exactly the between.

195
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The between the religio and this we don't it's so hard to it's so intangible it's so difficult to talk about.

196
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And so the idea I didn't know that I didn't know your thesis on this I know there was a whole scientific way attempt I know that there's someone being done in philosophy on it but.

197
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, I that that awareness that the thing that's hard to talk about might be the really real like might be the ball game is very exciting to me.

198
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So and this is a this is an idea from what's called for ecog sigh.

199
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:01,000
But I've coined a term I talk about the religio as neither subjective nor objective but transjective it's exactly the between don't know what that means.

200
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Well what it's a new term what it means is it's it's it's beyond in between the subjective and objective it's what binds the subjective and objective together so that meaning and truth are possible because neither subjectivity or objectivity will give you meaning nor truth.

201
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because meaning or truth are inherently relational in nature and then you combine together meaning religio and truth in a powerful way.

202
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Let me let me let me show you what what you're talking about.

203
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
So I want to take the I want to take the boober and I agree with you I thou I think is a very central book talked quite a bit in other places about boober.

204
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But I want to I want to then shift to a murdoch example that John Wright talks about murdoch talks about the mother in law who has his daughter in law that she regards is really kind of course and you know and rude and a little bit disorganized.

205
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And then one day she has this realization and notice the word I just used she has this realization that wait.

206
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Maybe her daughter is spontaneous and rounded and really authentic and maybe she's been understanding you know things these phenomena in exactly the wrong way.

207
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So notice she's she's getting an insight that's going in both directions and here's that opening.

208
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
She's getting an insight into who this person might be beyond all of her pattern predictions.

209
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
But she's also realizing that her way of framing it that way of doing this was also problematic and she needs to unlock the two together.

210
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And Wright calls that sensibility transcendence and what I'm trying to get you to note is what's happening there is this reciprocal opening of the relevance realization machinery.

211
00:26:48,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's like it's an insight it's like oh I was treating the wrong I was treating that I was seeing this in the wrong way was considering the wrong things I was ignoring the wrong things and the way I was framing it the way I was homing in on it was wrong.

212
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I have to open both up together and we get a sense like you said and this and then I want to drill down on another one of your quotes.

213
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
We get a sense of the really real and that's why I want to pause because you said that right and we use realization.

214
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And it's this betweenness and that's the really real and I want to talk about your.

215
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:39,000
First is that fair conversion I don't know what language is not offensive but you talk about I believe you're at a camp or something and you talk about it and you let me try and see if I can quickly find the actual quote because I thought it was really wonderful.

216
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You talk about having an ecstatic experience you quote Murdoch and the unselfing that I was just referring to so that's and you talk about it as terms of.

217
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Here, my question had been answered with an overwhelming felt presence.

218
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:13,000
An encounter with a you which you put in scare quotes which means don't use that word we the way we typically use it defined by love and acceptance and peace.

219
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And you also go on to talk about my life had acquired another dimension so reality is opening up this is a real real for you it's a realization it's a transformative realization.

220
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And it's the sense of a felt presence that right is something like but not the same as what we are normally capturing by you.

221
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And this is wonderful and I want you to unpack that a little bit more if you can and I know and we're both smiling and I appreciate your smile.

222
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm not expecting you to you know to be Thomas Aquinas here or anything like that nor am I expecting that I would be that.

223
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But what I want is I just want to play with you about this like real serious good faith play around.

224
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
These things are all coming together the sense of the really real the betweenness the loveless the love the connectedness presence.

225
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And you're not talking about like you're not talking about you know the presence of the terminate thing.

226
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think Boober is very clear about that right and you want to you want to say this is in the second person.

227
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's not the first person subjective it's not the third person objective it's the second person right transjective if you'll allow me my neologism and you're playing with all of this.

228
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And I think this is all resonant with what we've talked about so far but can just more say more like can go back on that because like that is so.

229
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Like this because I and later on when you're talking about God you talk about God more adverbial you talk about God as a way of paying attention.

230
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Right which is really really interesting much more relational much more adverbial rather than the properties of a thing.

231
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's a way in which there's a presence presencing if I can put it that way that seemed to be fair to how you're talking.

232
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
And the reason so part of this is selfish on my part part of it I'm doing a lot of work on this there's a book out.

233
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh I can't remember it called Presence right now on some of the COGS I about sense a felt sense of presence and we can sort of induce a little bit of it in the labs.

234
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Which doesn't mean it's an illusion because we can make you see a car when there's no car and that doesn't mean cars are illusion right that's a bad argument.

235
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But right so I'm part of me is the selfish scientist I really wanted you know somebody like you give me some data.

236
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Well give me some data but but but but but I promise you I'm not going to just I'm going to really listen also as a you.

237
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Right I'm going to listen because I care about this also as a person because I think right think about it wisdom is about this loving enhancement of our connectedness of our ability.

238
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:12,000
The wise person can go into a complex messy ill-defined situation and home in on what's relevant some in their agency in the right way so that they are properly responsible.

239
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And so there's a connection between the realization of this and the ability to be wise.

240
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Sorry I'm talking too much because I'm enthusiastic I'm going to shut up and open a space for you.

241
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Thank you.

242
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:35,000
No it is a very it's a tender and powerful invitation and as you know sort of when I approach with fear and trembling and the book where the bit in the book we're trying to address it directly is.

243
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It's like four paragraphs of explaining why this is hard.

244
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yeah so.

245
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What we're talking about in the source my most simple and familiar language is God is.

246
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Which I sometimes use the cinnamon of love for with a capital L.

247
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And that experience.

248
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Even though I've written about in the book someone's I'm currently trying to write about it again for someone who is fascinated by an essay for them and that they're like.

249
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I know you say words can't get at it but will you try like will you will you go more will you go deeper and so I'm really reaching for I want to help you.

250
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
The edges.

251
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah.

252
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Yeah the edges of language with it and the things that.

253
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The things that.

254
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
The things that come up for me.

255
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Are just the undeniability of.

256
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That moment of encounter and how.

257
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
How about how impossible it is because.

258
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Honestly like I can close my eyes now and.

259
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Know my know myself.

260
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Seen and.

261
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The.

262
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The deep the deep knowing of present of the presence of love in my life.

263
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And the way that every other moment of love and encounter and intimacy and reflection reflects that is.

264
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Is the ground is the ground of my being you know in Kierkegaard's.

265
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Understanding of it and.

266
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
In that moment it was really like.

267
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Night and day it was people have been theorizing theorizing about God around me and I've been a bit interested and.

268
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Questioning and been like maybe I believe maybe I don't believe asking loads of hard questions of this youth group that I randomly ended up in through a friend and then at this festival that I randomly ended up in because of fancy some of the boys.

269
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Not from a particularly Christian family at all like it wasn't a big deal in my childhood I didn't have it shaping my imaginative world as a child in a way that.

270
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Lots of people did for good or ill.

271
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I know that was complex for you but it.

272
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,000
It went from a theory to reality in that moment I asked a direct question and received a direct answer and.

273
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:22,000
You know the other thing that gets close to it and I quote is Pascal's what's known as the night of fire when he says.

274
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Not the God of the philosophers or the scholars.

275
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The are attempts to tame and theorize and analyze just get like.

276
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And you're left with.

277
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He says fire fire fire joy joy joy.

278
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You know.

279
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And as I've gone back to it and it feels.

280
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Feel there's a chapter in the book on sex and writing about sex felt less intimate and vulnerable than trying to write about the moment yes.

281
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Because it feels so holy and personal but.

282
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What I've been thinking about it is when I first when I when I had my babies.

283
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
When I met my babies for the first time and it was this weird mix of surprise and deep recognition.

284
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Surprise and recognition excellent that's that's.

285
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Like hello of course it's you.

286
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Also who are you.

287
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I know you I don't know you.

288
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Who are you.

289
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You're so here.

290
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And.

291
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Honestly that's that.

292
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I want to make sure I'm getting the connection sorry for interrupting.

293
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Please do that that that moment of.

294
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's call it like encounter.

295
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's almost like platonic and amnesis you remembered something you didn't know you had in you like Plato talks about this weird kind of remembering.

296
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Where like when we're doing when we're doing the dialogical practices with people they'll often say I discovered a form of intimacy.

297
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That I did not know about but I've always been looking for that kind of weird.

298
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yeah.

299
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay.

300
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

301
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So that's landing.

302
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Good.

303
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
So.

304
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And are you saying that that obviously also you're experiencing a particular kind of love you're pro you're experiencing the prototypical instance of agape.

305
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You're not loving this person because you want to consume them.

306
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
They're consumable.

307
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You're not loving them because they're a great friend and you've had a life together.

308
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
You're loving them because you're caught up in the process of.

309
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You know there's a possible there's a person that I'm going to participate in them in the creation of which is like analogous to God creating persons something like that the Bible uses that metaphor.

310
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And am I understanding you correctly you're using and saying that that intimate remembering of and surprise when I encountered my my babies is a close analogy to that sense of God.

311
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Am I am I I'm trying to get the make sure I'm not connecting it inappropriately.

312
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I mean the thing about this is everything every time I go okay it's like this I'm like yes but it's also not like it is.

313
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Yeah of course of course of course it's all these.

314
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It is literally a space beyond language and so the poet poetry gets closest.

315
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Music gets closest like and it really helped me I was reading I think Mike McHarg was and this might be one of those bullshit studies so forgive me I did not go check my references or look at the you know look at the rigorous rigorous.

316
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:50,000
That's how seriously I've been here but in some ways it's a metaphor but he was saying when when when researchers are trying to do fmi scanning on people in in sort of deep ecstatic states or deep prayer deep contemplative prayer particularly nuns that

317
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
have prayed prayed for a long long long time.

318
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The other type ecstatic states like akin to the kind of ones that I have the language center of the brain is just quiet.

319
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yep nothing is in the default mode network goes down to right which is your sense of self which is why you get that unselfing experience.

320
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Interesting that that is fairly good evidence by the way it has it's it's not bad.

321
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Great wouldn't want to be quite a bunch of science but it really helped me because I'm a writer right this is my thing.

322
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I love words.

323
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:43,000
The not the feeling like my sentences would like ricocheting off this memory and and that was something almost dishonorable about attempting to capture it.

324
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I both want to because I so want I so want to share this yeah it's the treasure.

325
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But also it is so personal and it's where I saw I don't believe in individuals but I do believe in persons and I do believe in human particularity and who knows what the soul is but it's the closest language I've got for.

326
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,000
The particular me that has connection with religio was encounter with either with divine love.

327
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And that you can't it has to be particular it has to be personal.

328
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
To be the really real.

329
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I think that's right I want to pick up.

330
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But first of all, you I want you I think you know this you're safe here to talk to me.

331
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm not out.

332
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm not gunning for anything.

333
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I know I do feel that.

334
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Okay, good.

335
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Good.

336
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Thank you.

337
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Secondly, I've had several of these kinds of experiences in my life.

338
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I also have practices that are designed and succeed in bringing me into a more reliable conformity to that realization of the really real.

339
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So this is something I think we deeply share.

340
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I think there's so there's a couple of things that are very one is this Agape and the great, you know, the great statement in the epistle of John, right?

341
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
God is Agape.

342
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's this got the this is an identity claim which we don't get very many of the Bible.

343
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And the identity claims there's basically for and they're all inherently relational.

344
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
God is love Agape club.

345
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
God is light, which is also relational.

346
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You don't see light.

347
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You see by means of light and the way it creates relations of intelligibility between things.

348
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
God is the logos and logos doesn't mean just word and we've tend to reduce logos to logic.

349
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But logos means this what you're trying to get at this ground of intelligibility.

350
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Right.

351
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And of course, God is also life.

352
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Right.

353
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And it's right.

354
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And life is inherently relational too.

355
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And I wanted to I wanted to I wanted to.

356
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So we've got this right.

357
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And yeah, I think persons are inherently relational things rather than substantial things.

358
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And there's something particular about them.

359
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The Buddhists have this term suchness.

360
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Everything actually has its suchness in some ways.

361
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
It's absolute.

362
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Like because anything, any words I use to talk about this is our categorical and they don't pick up on the suchness of this, the way it's not the way it's different from every all the other things in the category.

363
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And then there's also a moreness that that suchness is somehow non logically identical with all of the relations and connections that it bears.

364
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And I think persons are a particular kind of nexus there.

365
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I wonder if that you find that language helpful.

366
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
This surprise and recognition.

367
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I like Plato talks about this a lot.

368
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
This is how we this is how we recognize the forms.

369
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
We go.

370
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, but and then we go.

371
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, but of course, right?

372
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's that it's that it's that simultaneous like in and it's like and beauty is that combination is why beauty is so important to play.

373
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Beauty is a combination of surprise.

374
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But yet, right, of course.

375
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yes.

376
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I didn't I see it that way before.

377
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

378
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Exactly.

379
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And so that is all background and I'm not I didn't try to thread it as a premise by premise argument.

380
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I was just laying it out as okay.

381
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.

382
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because this is the thing that and I mentioned logos and light because they bring out that yes, we don't see the light and there's nothing in terms of which we can understand the logos.

383
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The Neoplatonists talk about the one is that by which you understand everything, but it's nothing.

384
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You can't conceive of the one because you can't put it outside of it of it in order to conceive of it as an object because it permeate that you keep trying to step out and looking and it's already behind you.

385
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Right.

386
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yeah.

387
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Right.

388
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Making it possible for you to live and move and have a being in.

389
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Exactly.

390
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Exactly.

391
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
But here's the thing.

392
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And I get the reverence.

393
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Right.

394
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The deep care because the importance notice the heightening of a legio, the deep care and the importance of this.

395
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And so I'm not trying to trespass on your reverence.

396
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But the question is like this.

397
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The thing that I'm driving at is maybe it's even asked its quest maybe is, but it doesn't mean that there is any disconnect from all of that intelligibility and that ground of intelligibility.

398
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The fact that the words don't capture it doesn't mean that there is this gap or space.

399
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
In fact, it, it reaches into the words.

400
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It permeates them.

401
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
It grounds them.

402
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Right.

403
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And it's, it's, it's, it's loving in that sense.

404
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It embraces them.

405
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It affords them.

406
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It makes them possible.

407
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It is the inexhaustible fount of flowing intelligibility.

408
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And so, and it's, and the reason why I get like that, it's that connection.

409
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
That's why we have the weirdness of the connection, I think, because the surprise is I can't capture it.

410
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But the, of course is, ah, but it's intimately interwoven with all of my sense making, all of the light of my world, all of the logos of my world.

411
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And for me, that's what I'm trying to, and you can see now I'm doing the same thing.

412
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm struggling.

413
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm doing things with my, my hands.

414
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah.

415
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Exactly.

416
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But did that, I'm trying to take a baby step here, but does that land for you what I was trying to get at?

417
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Because part of the, part of what I want to challenge and push against is people who think what we're doing is a kind of a kind, I don't know, something like a mystification, a kind of fundamental right otherness.

418
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It is, but it's, and you quote Williams about this, but it's, but it's also, as he points, it's anotherness that somehow embraces us, right?

419
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And isn't even competing with us, not one, not one Iota.

420
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm trying to get at, I'm trying to get that the surprise and the recognition are sort of the two sides of this, right?

421
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:15,000
The ineffable, but that is also nevertheless sourcing all of our intelligibility.

422
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Sorry, that was a lot, but that's, I want, my question is, does that resonate with you?

423
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Does that sing true to how your experiences are?

424
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I think so.

425
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm not sure if I've understood you, but I, the things that's making me think about are how the, that experience and the experiences that I have now felt like the cultural scripts around them were irrational.

426
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Right.

427
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:57,000
That they were sort of, yeah, that my identity, you know, I worked at the BBC for five years.

428
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I want to run a think tank in Westminster.

429
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I have two degrees.

430
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
You know, I'm a feminist.

431
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I'm sort of sickeningly metropolitan intelligentsia, at least in this aspiration.

432
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I read the New Yorker.

433
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Right.

434
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And so that seriously is disgusting.

435
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Self-making of my formation, you know, smart girl at school, jump the academic hoops.

436
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And honestly, when I was young, there was like two parts.

437
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You're going to be the hot girl or the smart girl.

438
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I'm going to be the smart girl.

439
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's who I am.

440
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
That's surprising.

441
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
You're quite a beautiful woman.

442
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Thank you.

443
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Okay.

444
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Teenagers, teenagers, you know, weird.

445
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Okay.

446
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But it, when, when you're thinking about the self that we make from the messages we get from the culture around us, intelligent became one of my things I wanted people to perceive me as.

447
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And it, it's very left homophoric, actually very male, disembodied.

448
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Increasing these science leaning, not humanities leaning, you know, that kind of.

449
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay.

450
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:26,000
In order to be respectable, in order to be impressive, in order to, to, to, to connect with the kind of people I'm interested in, in the world of ideas and the books, this bit of me that like lay flat on the floor weeping at the feet of Jesus when I was 15.

451
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I couldn't hold those two things together.

452
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:39,000
And so it, it fell apart and the bit that the things that we can't talk about the emotional experiential encounter of the really real.

453
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I didn't have categories for and no one around me had categories for and the kind of person I was wanting to be becoming required me to let it go.

454
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:57,000
And I think part of what the sort of quest I'm on is to push back against that and say.

455
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And I think your work and McGill Chris work on a bunch of other people in the last five years to go.

456
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Expand our understanding of what intelligence is, expand our understanding of how we access the real of what, how we perceive the world of what it might, what wisdom might mean.

457
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And it, like, honestly, I'm full circle.

458
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm back, I'm back, like, waving my praise flag, praying in tongues.

459
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And a part of my brain is like, what are you doing?

460
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And starts doing the like, you know, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the theories, all the psychology, all the crowd dynamics, all the credulity, all the, my friends who take psychedelics have these experiences is just induced all these things like some of that's going on in my brain.

461
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But this bit, you know, you talked about this, like, so the middle bit in the Plato thing, what I would call my soul is like, I need this.

462
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Is it Pascal again?

463
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm obsessed with Pascal.

464
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Like, I would, Pascal would be my boyfriend if he was alive now.

465
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
He said, the heart has reasons, reason knows not.

466
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah.

467
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And I'm like, and he talked about the difference between the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse, which prefigures Ian's work.

468
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I was, I just saw in a couple of weeks ago, we were at a conference celebrating his work together.

469
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And he and I have had several conversations together.

470
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So, I think we share that project.

471
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
What, let me just say, for example, there's a paper.

472
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
First author by Johannes Yeager, but I'm also a co-author on it with some other people.

473
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And we're in third round of revisions.

474
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
We had two reviewers and we went through all their edits.

475
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
We're ready to go.

476
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And then the third reviewer out of other blue finally sends in the review.

477
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,000
We have to start the whole process over again, which is, yes, those are some of the yuckiness of the academic world.

478
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
But I'm very confident we're going to get it published.

479
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And basically, and I presented this argument directly to Ian, like he was literally four feet away from me facing him.

480
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And he liked it.

481
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
But it's around the fact that.

482
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So logic is logic is an example of a formal system.

483
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Math is an example of a formal system.

484
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Like it's completely self-contained rule defining.

485
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And there's Godelian problems with it.

486
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And so remember that, but that's what a formal system is.

487
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And the proposal is that's what the left hemisphere likes.

488
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:33,000
The left hemisphere likes to use formal systems to solve well-defined problems like math problems and logical problems in which you have a very good representation.

489
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Of what matters.

490
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's all packaged for you there by the formal system.

491
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Now here, and that would be the spirit of geometry in Pascal.

492
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But the process of formalization of creating a formal system, which uses relevance realization is not itself something that can be done by a formal system.

493
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
The process that makes formal systems is not itself something done by a formal system.

494
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It is done by something that is dealing with messy, ill-defined flowing problems that require this very careful trading off between complex dynamics in a flowing dynamic gestalt.

495
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
And that's what Pascal means by the spirit of finesse.

496
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And what my work is trying to show is that intelligence isn't primarily a formal system.

497
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
It's about the ability to make and then once they're made use formal systems.

498
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And that's not that I'm trying to map everything onto the left and right because that can get very dangerous.

499
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
But think about this.

500
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's like, here's what can't be captured in any kind of formal system.

501
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:54,000
But nevertheless, it makes possible and is constantly shaping the possibility space for any formal system.

502
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And so the two are deeply interpenetrating.

503
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And I'm trying to say something like that.

504
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
See, I'm trying to maybe, sorry, this is audacious because I also respect Pascal the way you do.

505
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But I'm trying to say it's not just, there's two.

506
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
There's a deep religio between them.

507
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Finesse actually makes possible and fuels the spirit of geometry.

508
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Yeah.

509
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It makes sense.

510
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And I think resisting our temptation to swing too far back the other way.

511
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Okay.

512
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We've had too much of this bad.

513
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Let's have this different time of attention, this different kind of one.

514
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Again, if we think everything is about connection, if we think everything is about relationship, everything is about interdependence,

515
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,000
then it's leaving those competitive instincts in us, right?

516
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
That are like, my way is right.

517
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So your way must be wrong.

518
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Or maybe we need each other.

519
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Maybe we need the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse and they are designed to work together.

520
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
The imagery in my scriptures is of our body, right?

521
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
And the church is not always great at living this UK church right now, struggling with this.

522
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
But you know, the head cannot say to the foot, I do not need you.

523
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:16,000
When we are threatened, when we don't have a stable sense of self, when we do not know ourselves to be beloved,

524
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
the Rowan Williams talks about this in relation to God, like there's a relief sitting in the presence of the divine

525
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
because it's not constantly negotiating its identity in the way that we are.

526
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And the more I know that which is not constantly negotiating, God's not constantly negotiating God's identity.

527
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And in the presence of the divine, I no longer have to either, just loved, I'm a mess, I'm loved.

528
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Then I can go into the world and encounter other messy people who are loved,

529
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
who are presenting a completely different spirit from me, functioning the world completely differently.

530
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Naturally might threaten me because they don't care or they don't understand about the kind of things that we do, what this instincts in us.

531
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But I can kind of have an open heart to that and go, tell me more, you know, that's interesting.

532
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
What can we learn from each other?

533
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And that's so work for me.

534
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:19,000
That's like long, slow, steady muscle building of resisting the temptation to see everything in competition with each other.

535
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000

539
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Okay, that's beautiful.

540
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And that's a connection.

541
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And let me, let me try and make a connection with some of my current work that other people are doing on.

542
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Okay, so again, we think of logical as, and this is Descartes monological, what you do is the individual person running an argument.

543
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And of course, subject predicate logic, and that's where we get our substance property ontology and it's all bound together in this wonderful package.

544
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:22,000
But the problem is that we're now, we now have increasing evidence growing rapidly that we actually reason better together dialogically than we do individually monologically.

545
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Take standard reasoning tasks and individual does them and the success rates like 10%.

546
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
You replace that with four people who they have to dialogue with each other.

547
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So what I call that dialogos, they have to do this shared group agency and mutual correctiveness.

548
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
But if they, if they do that, they get that success rate goes up to 82%.

549
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Wow.

550
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I mean, that the finding doesn't surprise me this status.

551
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That's amazing.

552
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's, it is impressive.

553
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The Sperber and Mercier have done some of the important work on this, but more and more people are showing this.

554
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So, and this, of course, is part of why Plato and this always frustrated people.

555
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Why doesn't Plato just write his arguments because Plato is trying to show because you have to show this, right?

556
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That we reason best dialogically, not monologically, right?

557
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Now think about that.

558
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Think about how there has to be something that makes the dialogos possible.

559
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And what you're talking about, if I understand you correctly, is you have a sensed participation in this presence that allows you to enter into and make possible a dialogical mode with others that actually is ultimately more reasonable.

560
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Yeah.

561
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yeah.

562
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That we are made in the image of a God who is relationship, right?

563
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Even, even in the heart of the divine, there's no monologue.

564
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's no monad.

565
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Okay, so that, and we're, so I'm going to invite you right now to come back.

566
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
We got to talk a lot more if you want.

567
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Okay, so, so I've been, I'm doing, of course, ultimate reality, God and beyond.

568
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Don't be put off by the title.

569
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm trying to explore thinkers who are getting beyond the, the monological substance, subject predicate logic model of God, which I think has become predominant.

570
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And then one of the things that I think is really strangling sort of current theism.

571
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But James Filler's astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being, he makes an argument that Neoplatonists were actually trying to argue that ultimate reality is pure relationality.

572
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Information is purely relational.

573
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Quantum entanglement is purely relational.

574
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Relativity is purely relational.

575
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Intelligibility is purely relational.

576
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You can, you can get things out of relations, but you can't get relations out of things.

577
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
That's why we had the collapse of nominalism and all those problems.

578
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It's an astonishingly brilliant book.

579
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:12,000
And then he makes the argument that Christian Neoplatonism is actually a kind of apogee because Christian Neoplatonism says yes.

580
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And our sacred appreciation, and I'm trying to use that word in all of its meanings, our sacred appreciation of ultimate reality is very well captured in the image.

581
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
In an imaginal sense of an image, the image of the Trinity.

582
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Like you said, God is not a monologue.

583
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
God is an inherently dialogical.

584
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,000
All, all of the persons are inherently relational in their nature and they're bound together.

585
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And the identity claims of God are relational, logos, love.

586
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And this is, and he's saying, people don't get this.

587
00:58:49,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Although he says, I suppose this is shameless advertising for my friend, Bishop, Bishop Maximus, because Eastern Orthodoxy tries, is very much more awake and alive to these thinkers, the Cappadocian fathers, Dionysus, people like this, Maximus, obviously,

588
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:24,000
that, right, people don't get this because they're still trying to understand this presence, this pure relationality, this you that isn't bound to a specific thing, but somehow is the you of all youing.

589
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I don't know if that even means anything, but that's how I, that's how I sort of understand it, and that they're trying to grasp that with the subject predicate logic.

590
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
And then they're trying to grasp it with substance property ontology.

591
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And therefore they, the only way they misunderstand it is they think, well, it must be a super substance, a super thing that owns and is the author of all things and all properties between them.

592
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And I think, and you may push back against me on this and that's fine, but I think this is an important thing that is happening right now.

593
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I think there's an advent of the sacred going on, both within, I think people are groping towards that anemesis of this understanding that we once had in Christianity, I will put it that way, Neoplatonic Christianity,

594
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and they're finding, not unsurprisingly, that it is deeply resonant with aspects of Zen Buddhism or Taoism, where the same language is being used in powerful ways.

595
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And you very clearly state in the book that you're open to learning from other traditions beyond Christianity.

596
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I understand Christianity is your home and I'm not trying to take you from it.

597
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:49,000
But I, so I've sort of laid my heart and my thought on the table about, like, and I know you're not doing this, so I'm not attributing to this to you.

598
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I think saying God is love, that ultimate reality is ultimately relational is way, way, way, two more ways, way, way more radical than people realize.

599
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:13,000
It is a profound challenge to our default way of thinking, of interacting, of determining what's real, of sensing.

600
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Like, it's, sorry, now I fall into a poria.

601
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And I'm wondering if that lands with you.

602
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Yes.

603
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Yes, it does.

604
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because the word love has been worn out by overuse, right?

605
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Oh, yeah, and trivialization.

606
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yeah, I, so I talk about sitting in the book quoting Francis Buffard, who forgive me, I'm going to swear for reader distance with sensitive is, but I think it's important.

607
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He calls it the human propensity to fuck things up.

608
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, I think that's excellent.

609
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Brute the brutality of it really helps me.

610
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And when I interviewed him, I said, I need you to do the same thing for love.

611
01:01:52,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And he just take this word, which is everything, and help us hear it again, because we can't hear it.

612
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And it slides past our consciousness and it goes in one ear and out the other.

613
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And to say God is love, reality is love, reality is relational.

614
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
All living is meeting.

615
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Everything is relationship.

616
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's not strong enough.

617
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's not radical enough.

618
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's not profound enough to, and this is the key for me to make us change our behavior, to make us change our orientation and our heart posture.

619
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It might make some people go, interesting, interesting ideas, interesting theories.

620
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Oh, isn't that cute?

621
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Lovely, nice.

622
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Honestly, and I'm going to sound more like a like, I'm going to sound more like a Pentecostal preacher than I usually do.

623
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:55,000
But if it doesn't fundamentally in some way drive you to your knees, drive you into worship of some kind, into a seeking after and encounter with that love, then that's just like head knowledge.

624
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Yeah.

625
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I think that was beautiful.

626
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You're pointing back to Pascal's fire, right?

627
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
If it doesn't have that fire, right?

628
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Then the problem is, I mean, and, um, I mean,

629
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I mean, other people have written about this, perhaps better than I, but, um, you know, we've trivialized love to being a feeling of love isn't a feeling.

630
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That's ridiculous.

631
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
And then people think, oh, what love is an emotion and love isn't an emotion.

632
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I love my partner profoundly.

633
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
And that sometimes makes me happy.

634
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It sometimes makes me sad.

635
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I miss her right now.

636
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Sometimes it makes me angry if somebody is insulting her and I want to, because there is a function of emotion, of the emotion of anger, just to protect those things you genuinely value if they're threatened, right?

637
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And you realize, oh, all of those are expressions of love.

638
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
All of those emotions are expressions of love.

639
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So love isn't an emotion.

640
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Love is an existential stance.

641
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
It's a, it's a way of being.

642
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:02,000
It's a way of participating in the identity of something or someone else and allowing them to participate in yours.

643
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
It's a religio.

644
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It's a binding that reciprocally opens.

645
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And then if you say, oh, okay, that's good.

646
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:19,000
And you say, but think maybe reality is a binding that reciprocally opens and maybe that's why our minds evolved to try and focus in on this as a fundamental thing.

647
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Maybe that's the logos of the ontos, the ontology, the ontologos and our psyche logos is actually evolved to be able to track and conform to that.

648
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:43,000
And that experience, the one where we experience that most is in the experience of love understood in this wise way, not in as a feeling or not as, ooh, not as infatuation, not as desire.

649
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,000
You can like you, you, this is one of the most important tests for the longevity of love.

650
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Do you love someone even when you don't desire them?

651
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That's an important question to ask yourself.

652
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And when you get a clear answer to that is yes, I do.

653
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Then you go, oh, right.

654
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Love isn't right.

655
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Love, love can express itself in desire.

656
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Hopefully so love can express itself in all these, but love is behind them all.

657
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And it's because we have such a shallow notion of love that we find it so hard to believe that we people could say ultimate reality is love.

658
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Well, oh, that's that's a very pleasant metaphor.

659
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
No.

660
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Right.

661
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:29,000
You really open up with that is and then that opens you up to reality in a profound way.

662
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Yeah.

663
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I mean, I think you're right that the sort of conflation of romance with love is non, non erotic loves are as much the really real.

664
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Like deep friendship.

665
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We have devalued it parent child.

666
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Like the though those loves are as much the root to wisdom and growth and fully aliveness as sexual love is.

667
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
And we just have devalued them.

668
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But honestly, John, the thing that's making me think of and I'm sort of surprising myself by going here is that in my tradition, the symbol of love is a torture instrument.

669
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Right.

670
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It is that he opened his arms of love upon the cross that the that's another thing that keeps me on my tradition that it resists abstraction.

671
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:27,000
It resists generalization to the point of no bite through the incarnation and the crucifixion and the resurrection and the no greater love has anyone than this that they would lay down their life for their friends.

672
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And that is what I think is.

673
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Is it the Greek words that you just can no sis self emptying.

674
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yes.

675
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
The love.

676
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Love as opposite of pride.

677
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Love as opposite of withdrawal into ourselves as the toenail turned in ourselves.

678
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But like outward to the point that we might even lay down our lives.

679
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
We might even empty ourselves.

680
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:57,000
And that that has been done for us is is is like gritty, dirty, bloody, painful, not fluffy.

681
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
You are not going to draw a Valentine's card about it.

682
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Right.

683
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It's just to do completely different things.

684
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That's a very good point.

685
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's a very good point.

686
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
The cross prevents the Valentine's Hallmark carding of love.

687
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That's a very good argument.

688
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I like that.

689
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I don't know if you're aware of it.

690
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I think it's John Cobb.

691
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The Christian theologian has an anthology.

692
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I haven't read it yet, but I'm looking forward to it called the self emptying God, because

693
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,000
there's this ongoing discussion between Buddhists from the Kyoto school, like Maso Abe.

694
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And there's Jewish theologians and Christian theologians all talking about this, this notion

695
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,000
of the self emptying God and how each one of your traditions says this is something very,

696
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
very central that has been lost.

697
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And they find that obviously they don't all agree, because there's no sort of mush religion

698
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
that everything will dissolve into or anything ridiculous like that.

699
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
But they do all seem to be converging, at least on, we all want to talk about this and

700
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
make this more prominent.

701
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Again, this notion, I think of kinosus and the connections between kinosus and theosis,

702
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
especially in the Eastern Orthodox, because if you hear theosis divination, right, the

703
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Eastern Orthodox idea,

704
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,000
divination has been coming like God, not as in the lesson in Harry Potter.

705
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

706
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But it's all my level of references.

707
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Well, the idea is, yeah, but you become it's not inflationary because the theosis is interwoven

708
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
with the most extreme form of kinosus.

709
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Yes, you can be Godlike.

710
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And you know what you have to do?

711
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You have to do the most radical self emptying to participate in God, right?

712
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And I think you're saying...

713
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
The first shall be lost.

714
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

715
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And I do think there's something important about this.

716
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And I mean,

717
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
what's coming up for me now is,

718
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Han and his book, Saving Beauty talks about the reduction of beauty.

719
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
We've taken the shock out of beauty, right?

720
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And so I'm going to say something that I think an ancient would get, but a modern person would find

721
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
repellent.

722
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I think the crucifixion is beautiful.

723
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Not because it's pleasant or pleasing.

724
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Han talks about how we've reduced beauty to the smooth, the easily gratifying, the easily graspable.

725
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
But if you read Plato and Platinus or read even Rilke, you know, beauty is an angel that

726
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
could kill us, but decides not to.

727
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Like, come on, think of that language, right?

728
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That's again, like, right?

729
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
The profound shock of it.

730
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
But it's...

731
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But you did that.

732
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You did this thing.

733
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It's a shock that immediately you go, but of course, because if I didn't have that shock, it wouldn't

734
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
awaken me to what love really is.

735
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And then that is what I mean by saying this is a kind...

736
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So I'm saying it's not only that we've trivialized love.

737
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
We've trivialized beauty and those two things, those trivializations in some sort of...

738
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I have a complicit, right?

739
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Mutually reinforcing fashion that traps us.

740
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
And I think the epitome of that is pornography, because pornography is the reduction of love

741
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
and the reduction of beauty to the smooth.

742
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,000
And Han has a very good book on the agony of Eros.

743
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You seem to be nodding when I was...

744
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Is that also resonating with you?

745
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I mean, so much of that is resonating with me.

746
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I just can't order my many, many thoughts.

747
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
The first one was about beauty as...

748
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Obviously Aquinas talks about goodness, truth and beauty as one way of thinking about God.

749
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
And we hear the beauty better like pretty, like nice.

750
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And it...

751
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Kant has a work on aesthetics, which is the only bit of Kant I know, to be clear.

752
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And he...

753
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
He's thinking about the sublime and the numinous.

754
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Is that like...

755
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Actually, it's quite scary.

756
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
It's the bit...

757
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's when we encounter something that could kill us and does not.

758
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And the way I think about it is that it sort of makes us feel right-sized.

759
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
That part of the agony of being a 21st century of human is that

760
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
we are trying to be something we are not.

761
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Like we are trying, like relevance, whatever it was, that there's just so much.

762
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
There's so much.

763
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And we're supposed to create ourselves.

764
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
We're supposed to decide.

765
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
We're supposed to know everything.

766
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
We're supposed to be across all these references.

767
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
We're supposed to have read everything.

768
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
We're supposed to be thin and successful.

769
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
And we're supposed to say the word from climate change.

770
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And we're also just like, we are not gods.

771
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
We are not...

772
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
You've all...

773
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
No, Harari is wrong.

774
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
We are...

775
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
There is...

776
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
That is beyond us.

777
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And when we encounter...

778
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
I think the real...

779
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The real divine, the real God of love beyond us.

780
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Yes, it's quite scary because we feel our smallness

781
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
and we feel our vulnerability and we feel our fragility.

782
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And I think we feel our sin.

783
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We feel our disconnection.

784
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
We feel all the ways we have not lived up to the kind of people that our soul longs us to be.

785
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
But it is also sort of a relief.

786
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Because then we're rightsized and we know where we are.

787
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
The thing about porn is that was the scariest part to write

788
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
because I am basically trying to make quite a full-throated defence of the Christian sexual ethic

789
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
from a feminist perspective.

790
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
And to say, yes, I know...

791
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I know, I know, I know that this church teaching around sin

792
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
has been used as a cost to beat people,

793
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
gay people and women in particular.

794
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
However, it...

795
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
At its heart, I think is about a refusal to treat another human being as an object

796
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and a very, very high attunement to power imbalances.

797
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And my argument against porn comes down to the disconnecting formation

798
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
of treating another person like an object.

799
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Totally, totally. I think that.

800
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
So there's a couple of things that come up for me.

801
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
There's all this scientific work going on in awe right now.

802
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I'm involved in it.

803
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
We're running an experiment.

804
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Some of the work that's come out of it that seems pretty reliable.

805
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Keltner and Jennifer Steller here at the University of Toronto

806
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
is awe does that proper proportion.

807
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Awe is...

808
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:39,000
And think how it does relate to our word aweful, right?

809
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But awe is...

810
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
People reliably report a shrinking of the self.

811
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
But one of the interesting things about awe is it's one...

812
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Now, if you push it too far, that becomes horrific

813
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
because if the shrinking goes too far, you get horror, right?

814
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But awe is...

815
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It is one of the few experiences where the self shrinks

816
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
and people experience it positively.

817
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's not shame, right?

818
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's not depression.

819
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
It's shrinking, but it's positive.

820
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And you know, this is Murdoch.

821
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Love is the painful recognition that something other than yourself is real.

822
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I propose, this is a hypothesis,

823
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
that that unselfing actually makes us realize a possible connection to reality

824
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
that we always longed for but didn't know that we were longing for it.

825
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And that's why, although the self shrinks, we get something positive.

826
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Now, for me...

827
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
And this is where I'm putting on my Cognitive Scientist hat,

828
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
but I'm going to also put on my Plato hat.

829
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
The thing about that is, like, you can imagine, right?

830
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You can imagine that there's two sins.

831
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Plato was worried about two things.

832
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Drew Highland's book on finite transcendence,

833
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
that Plato was always trying to get us to get that we are always finite,

834
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and that means finitude, fallible, right?

835
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
But we are also open to transcendence.

836
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
And he says, if we just fall into our finitude, we can fall into despair.

837
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
We can fall into horror, right?

838
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
We can lose a sense of the proper dignity of a person.

839
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You could just... Right?

840
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Right?

841
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
So, we have to also realize that we are responsible to transcendence.

842
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
But if we just identify with the transcendent pole,

843
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
then we suffer hubris and inflation.

844
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And he says, what you have to do is you have to have a tonus.

845
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
You have to get this proper proportioning, proper sizing.

846
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
But it's... I'm trying to change it from size to...

847
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
When I'm not trying to change it, I'm trying to amplify your sizing

848
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
to making it inherently relational.

849
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's a sizing that puts you in a light relationship,

850
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
right position, like the right holding together of right,

851
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
your finitude and your transcendence.

852
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And I think one of the problems we have,

853
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
and this goes to your polarization chapter,

854
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
is we have severed those.

855
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And the left says, we're so finite, and we're so subject to fate,

856
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
and we need compassion, and they're right.

857
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
But the right says, but when they're both at their best,

858
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
because neither one of them is at their best right now.

859
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They're at their worst right now.

860
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
But when they're at their best, and the right says,

861
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
yes, but we're not just animals.

862
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We're persons called to responsibility.

863
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
We have a relationship to the true, the good, and the beautiful.

864
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
And then what you need is a dialogical relationship

865
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
between them for a healthy society.

866
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And of course, we've abandoned all that.

867
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
We've polarized. We've changed that into...

868
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Each side is now at its worst trying to kill the other

869
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and demonizing the other.

870
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I'm trying to bring a lot of what you said into one thing.

871
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So I'm wondering if, because here's the thing,

872
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and I got to be careful here.

873
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
So the research that's coming, that we're doing right now

874
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
seems to show something.

875
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Sorry, there's a long time, but I'm sort of building an argument.

876
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I love it. Keep going.

877
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Okay.

878
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So I thought, awe is this, right?

879
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Opening up and everything.

880
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
So what you should see is if we induce awe experiences

881
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and we have some reliable experimental techniques

882
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
using the overview effect and music,

883
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and people can get sort of that awe, right?

884
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Then you should see increased measures of cognitive flexibility

885
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
because those indicate that people's minds are opening

886
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
and they're exploring possibility.

887
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
So we induce awe and we do all these tests

888
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and no measures of cognitive flexibility.

889
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
What awe predicts is a confidence

890
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
in any insight you might have.

891
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Now, that can be very dangerous, as you can imagine,

892
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
but here's the proposal which I've been making

893
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
to my fellow researchers.

894
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The point is an awe.

895
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
The point is a humble sense of the transcendent.

896
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
The point is reverence and reverence is a virtue.

897
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And what the awe does is it gives you some confidence

898
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
to start cultivating reverence,

899
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
but you don't get the cognitive benefits

900
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
from the experience of awe.

901
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You get the cognitive benefits from taking up the encouragement.

902
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I use that word very deeply, right?

903
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
To cultivate a proper reverence.

904
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
What are you meaning by reverence in that context?

905
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So what I mean by reverence is exactly that tonos,

906
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
that creative tension.

907
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Sorry, I'm using a Greek word

908
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
because our English word tension is only negative for people now.

909
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
We forget Heraclitus, the tension of the bow,

910
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
the tension of the liar,

911
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
the tension that holds the bridge together.

912
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Muscle.

913
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

914
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
And so I think of reverence,

915
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
and this is somewhat similar,

916
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
but I think also different with,

917
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
is it Woodruff's?

918
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Woodward?

919
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
The book on reverence is a forgotten virtue.

920
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But I think of reverence as a humble wonder

921
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
that we get the profound sense of our finitude.

922
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That's the shrinking.

923
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
But we are wondering, not in the sense of curiosity.

924
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Curiosity is trying to get something.

925
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Wonder is calling things into question, including oneself.

926
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
We get a humble wondering towards things.

927
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That's what I'm calling reverence.

928
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
And that takes time and effort to cultivate

929
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
because it's a virtue.

930
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's not just an experience.

931
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
That's what I'm talking about.

932
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Okay, that's making sense to me.

933
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yes, that does.

934
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So one of the things I reflect on a lot

935
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
are these peak experiences,

936
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
these ecstatic encounters

937
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
that have been really defining in my spiritual life,

938
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
but are not sufficient.

939
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Exactly.

940
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It really, it really,

941
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
when I talk to,

942
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm sorry to bang on about this,

943
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
but I've got lots of friends at the moment

944
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
who are taking a lot of psychedelics,

945
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
and I'm very interested

946
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
in what it's doing to our spiritual landscape.

947
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And there are some similarities

948
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
between the peak experiences they have

949
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
on psychedelics and the peak,

950
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
what I would call my experiences of the Holy Spirit.

951
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
We don't know because they go beyond language

952
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and we can't actually compare them.

953
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
But we at least can see in each other

954
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
that something's happened, that it's big,

955
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
and it involves our bodies and our emotions,

956
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
as well as an idea.

957
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And I was talking to my friend, Jules Evans,

958
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
about this recently as a psychedelic journalist.

959
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yeah, I know Jules.

960
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Yeah, yeah.

961
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And I was saying, I think,

962
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I mean, within Christianity to be clear,

963
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
the fact that I'm a charismatic Christian

964
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
makes me quite a weirdo.

965
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
There are lots of us,

966
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
but it is not something that all Christians

967
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
have speaking tongues or have these

968
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
exotic encounters.

969
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But the bit of, I would say my flesh

970
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
or the bit of me that's foolish

971
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
just wants it to be about those

972
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
because those are some amazing, right?

973
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Super pleasurable.

974
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

975
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Really connecting, really nourishing.

976
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
But they are,

977
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
and I think it was,

978
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
who has the pyramid of needs?

979
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Maslow.

980
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Maslow.

981
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Talks about them as-

982
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Actually, by the way,

983
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
that's a misattribution.

984
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Maslow doesn't have that pyramid.

985
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That was put in all the psychology textbooks

986
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
and attributed to Maslow.

987
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Maslow is much closer to Aristotle

988
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
than to that pyramid.

989
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Interesting.

990
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
By the way, beyond self-realization,

991
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Maslow had a final thing

992
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
that doesn't show up on most pyramids.

993
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
He had self-transcendence.

994
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah.

995
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So that's the,

996
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
this is making me feel better now

997
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
because that's the bit I quote.

998
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah.

999
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So he's talking about the relationship

1000
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
between religion and these exotic experiences.

1001
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And Maslow's fundamental understanding

1002
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
is that religion is these moments of encounter

1003
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
and then around it accrue all these dogmas

1004
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
and these rules and these regulations

1005
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
that stop looking like real religion,

1006
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
which these ecstatic experiences.

1007
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And I'm like, no, Maslow.

1008
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The peak experience is,

1009
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I would say my experience with the Holy Spirit,

1010
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
my moments of encounter with God

1011
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
should send me back

1012
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
into the rigorous spiritual path

1013
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
of trying to grow in faith, hope and love

1014
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and love my neighbor.

1015
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And if they are just some solipsistic

1016
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
self-actualization that,

1017
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
in my tradition, this is sort of worse than useless

1018
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
because spiritual gifts are for other people.

1019
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
They are doggedly communal.

1020
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,000
We receive these things to make us better

1021
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
at loving each other.

1022
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
And so I sort of joke with Jules

1023
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
about charismatic Christianity is my set and setting.

1024
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Like, I need a book to come,

1025
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
to check it against.

1026
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I need a community who are wise

1027
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
and know me and will be like, no Liz,

1028
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
that thing that happened to you

1029
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
in that ecstatic experience

1030
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
does not sound like it is going to lead you

1031
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
towards love or fully aliveness.

1032
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It sounds like foolishness.

1033
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Also, you're getting a bit self-obsessed.

1034
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And I need, frankly, to be repeatedly told

1035
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
that I'm mainly supposed to be feeding the pool,

1036
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
like not getting out of my head

1037
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
on divine love much as I need that

1038
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
and want it and temperamentally,

1039
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
it's where I would spend all my time.

1040
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I think that's right.

1041
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm teaching a course right now

1042
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
on the nature and function of the self.

1043
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And it's just wrapped up.

1044
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And I had a student in there

1045
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
and the work I was teaching

1046
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and the work the student was coming together,

1047
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
converging on this idea

1048
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
that these peak experiences,

1049
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
they are, as you said, they're not sufficient.

1050
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
They're necessary.

1051
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
What they do is they,

1052
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
and this is the term that's now emerging,

1053
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
they create epistemic vulnerability.

1054
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
They make you vulnerable to new ways of knowing,

1055
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
new possibilities of seeing and being.

1056
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But if you don't have the setting

1057
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
and I would add the sapiential framework

1058
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
and ecology of practices

1059
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
oriented towards the cultivation of wisdom and virtue,

1060
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
that epistemic vulnerability can go,

1061
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
it has the potential to go in multiple directions.

1062
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You get the conspirituality, right?

1063
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It makes you hugely vulnerable to abuse,

1064
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
gurus, cults, blah, blah, blah.

1065
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
That's right.

1066
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And so like you, I reject that idea

1067
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
and Huxley has it to some degree,

1068
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
that if we could just peel away

1069
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
all of this, all of these doctrines and structures.

1070
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Now I'm very, I have issues around reducing

1071
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
religio to credo.

1072
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
We can talk about that when we talk next.

1073
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But I do agree with you that you need,

1074
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
you need a practice and principles

1075
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
and philosophical in the wisdom,

1076
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
cultivating sense framework

1077
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
that's housed, sorry, wrong word,

1078
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
homed in a community for these peak experiences

1079
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
to turn into transformative experiences

1080
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:49,000
that are transforming people towards wisdom and virtue.

1081
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I think the evidence is mounting for that, by the way.

1082
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah.

1083
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Great.

1084
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
This is a good place to end, I think.

1085
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,000
This has been truly full of wonder, wonderful in that sense.

1086
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I've really enjoyed this

1087
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
and I hope that you found that you had enough,

1088
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
that I wasn't talking too much,

1089
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
that you have found enough time to speak.

1090
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I didn't want this to be an interview.

1091
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I wanted this to be the logos.

1092
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
This is much more fun, a conversation.

1093
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Yeah, and yes, exactly.

1094
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
And sparking insight and interest in each other,

1095
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
asking interested questions rather than interesting questions.

1096
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
That's a distinction that my friend,

1097
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Mr. Firmaster-Pietro, has brought into the dialogical practice.

1098
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But I definitely want you to come back

1099
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
and I hope we can continue and doing,

1100
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,000
diving a little bit more.

1101
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Maybe we can do a little bit more about the vices

1102
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
and the virtues and a little bit more, again,

1103
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
about what we were talking about.

1104
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And what is the relationship between religio and credo?

1105
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
And how do we hold that relationship in the context

1106
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
of a lot of the things we seem to be resonating

1107
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and converging on?

1108
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
That's what I propose for our next discussion.

1109
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Sounds brilliant.

1110
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
So, Elizabeth, I always give my guests the last word.

1111
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You can be cumulative, summative, provocative, elusive,

1112
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
whatever you want to say.

1113
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm so tempted to go nitwit, blubber.

1114
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What is my last word?

1115
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I think holding onto the fact that love is the really real.

1116
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
If you had to bore wisdom down to that,

1117
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
you wouldn't go far wrong.

1118
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Yeah.

1119
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Thank you so much.

1120
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I look forward to our next discussion.

1121
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Thank you so much for having me.
