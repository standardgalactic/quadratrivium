00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
John Varvakey and Sean Coyne have together authored a new book,

00:03.200 --> 00:07.840
Mentoring the Machines. It's a book about artificial intelligence and the path forward

00:07.840 --> 00:13.120
that further develops the arguments of how to align artificial intelligence to human flourishing,

00:13.120 --> 00:17.280
and it sets those arguments into beautiful and accessible writing. It's an incredibly

00:17.280 --> 00:24.240
timely book. In fact, it will be released August 1st, 2023, as a four-part series that will culminate

00:24.240 --> 00:29.840
into a final volume. You can pre-order today a special edition copy that will include a

00:29.920 --> 00:33.840
signed hardback edition. Pre-order in the link in the description below.

00:34.400 --> 00:40.160
Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Varvakey. I'm very excited here to be talking with Joe

00:40.160 --> 00:44.800
Alto. We are going to be doing an interesting thing. I'll let Joe talk about it a little bit more.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.280
Although he's on Voices with Varvakey, we want you to consider that this is, I'm also on Joe's

00:49.280 --> 00:54.640
channel. We're sort of going to be interviewing each other and talking for both audiences in

00:54.720 --> 01:00.880
integrated fashion. Welcome, Joe. Thank you so much for having me, John. Just a quick introduction,

01:00.880 --> 01:06.240
I guess, about myself. As John just mentioned, I have my own YouTube channel called the Gist

01:06.240 --> 01:11.280
with Joe. That channel is really dedicated to talking to what I consider great minds in the

01:11.280 --> 01:18.240
fields of psychology and philosophy, theology, really just culture in general. I essentially

01:18.240 --> 01:22.800
ask my guests, what's the gist of their intellectual, their artistic, their spiritual

01:22.800 --> 01:31.520
project? We know that distilling what your project is to the gist is a good practice. I like doing

01:31.520 --> 01:38.400
this with my guests, and it usually blossoms into a really beautiful and meaningful conversation

01:38.400 --> 01:45.520
afterwards. That's going to be one part of our conversation today. As John said, I'll be on Voices

01:45.520 --> 01:51.920
with Varvakey. John will be on the gist with Joe. Obviously, my channel is much more teeny tiny than

01:51.920 --> 02:00.000
John's. I guess even further introduce myself. I'm currently studying clinical mental health

02:00.000 --> 02:11.120
counseling. I am the campus minister at a public university in Cleveland, Ohio, and just very

02:11.120 --> 02:20.640
interested in pursuing what my, as a Catholic man with the church fathers or what other great

02:20.640 --> 02:25.360
thinkers in philosophy in general would consider the good, the true, the beautiful. I'm on that

02:25.360 --> 02:32.720
search myself. It's a hard, long search, but having conversations with great thinkers is

02:32.720 --> 02:37.200
something that helps me with that endeavor. I'm just really honored to be on today. Thank you so much,

02:37.200 --> 02:46.400
Jen. Thank you, Joe. Let me go first. I'll happily answer your gist question. On my side,

02:46.400 --> 02:53.360
I guess what I'm really interested in hearing from you and talking about it a bit is how does

02:53.360 --> 03:01.680
my work intersect with your pursuit, your quest as a Catholic man to track the true, the good, and

03:01.680 --> 03:09.200
the beautiful? How does my work, like, does it help? Does it afford? Does it challenge? Is it a

03:09.200 --> 03:14.400
problem? Well, it definitely does a lot. It definitely does a lot. Challenge is one really

03:14.400 --> 03:22.080
good thing. Help is another. It helps a lot. And so, you know, as a Catholic, I will explain,

03:22.080 --> 03:26.800
so, you know, I'm a Catholic campus minister, but I'm also studying intensively right now.

03:26.800 --> 03:34.160
I'll be able to practice next April. I actually start my clinical internship in a couple weeks,

03:34.160 --> 03:39.680
so I actually start seeing fiction soon. So I'm on this journey right now as I stated in clinical

03:39.680 --> 03:47.760
mental health. And, you know, I don't have any plans of ever advertising myself, per se, as a

03:47.760 --> 03:54.560
Catholic counselor. I actually think, and you know what, anyone who does religious specific

03:54.560 --> 04:00.480
counseling, that's very needed. And I laud, you know, anyone who's watching who does, like I said,

04:00.480 --> 04:10.160
religious specific counseling. However, given just my charisms, my personality, just what my

04:11.040 --> 04:17.760
goal in this profession is, I don't necessarily plan on ever advertising myself as a Catholic

04:17.760 --> 04:25.920
counselor. However, I do believe that in my, it's in my opinion that counseling, you know, psychotherapy

04:26.800 --> 04:34.240
is, one can consider a spiritual or religious endeavor. There's many Christian, there's many

04:34.240 --> 04:41.120
Buddhists, there's many Islamic, there's many Jewish, there's really all, every major, you know,

04:41.120 --> 04:47.360
world religion and the ethos of that religion, you can see elements of that in the counseling

04:47.360 --> 04:53.440
profession, right? And so, it's not going to ever be explicit, but you know, it's more so in the

04:53.440 --> 05:02.000
implicit of my counseling, that I want to, well, that I will express or exude my Christian faith

05:02.000 --> 05:07.040
that ever, without ever, possibly ever stating, hey, I'm a Christian man. And so, John, what is

05:07.040 --> 05:14.640
your work coming in for this? So, although I've only had a couple encounters, right, with people

05:14.640 --> 05:21.920
coming to counseling, but in my, in my time in classes, in my work reading the great thinkers of

05:21.920 --> 05:27.920
both, you know, just the psychological field and just even the counseling field, I do know that,

05:28.800 --> 05:33.200
and although I don't have any stats to prove it, this is more operating the anecdote right here,

05:34.080 --> 05:40.400
I do know that many people go to counseling, not for, well, what we would consider, what the DSM

05:40.400 --> 05:45.280
would consider, you know, a particular disorder, right? So, not everyone, so people who are depressed

05:45.920 --> 05:52.800
don't always have a major depressive episode or major depressive disorder, right? People who are

05:52.800 --> 05:59.760
anxious don't always have a specific phobia or generalized anxiety disorder, and that's actually

05:59.760 --> 06:04.480
one of the downfalls of the current field of counseling, in my opinion, is, you know, the

06:04.480 --> 06:11.200
overdiagnoses of these diseases. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. You said it, and again, I don't know the,

06:11.200 --> 06:16.000
I'm going to misfire on the exact quote, but you once said that in all of his time counseling,

06:16.000 --> 06:21.360
around something like 60% of the patients he ever saw were never dealing with an actual

06:21.360 --> 06:26.240
psychological disorder, but they were dealing with, and John, this is where you come in, a crisis of

06:26.240 --> 06:35.520
meaning. Yes, yes, yes. And, you know, your work has been so influential in what I want to do when I

06:35.520 --> 06:41.760
hopefully knock on wood, right? Either I work with a group or I open up my own practice one day,

06:41.760 --> 06:49.840
I want to create really this psychotherapeutic model that invites the individual to think more

06:49.840 --> 06:57.120
deeply about virtue, and that's one thing that I really think plagues so many people. It's like,

06:57.120 --> 07:06.720
if you could just realize, right, how virtues can be, virtue cultivation, how virtue cultivation

07:06.720 --> 07:17.520
be so profound and have such a reformational, such a reformational influence on your life,

07:17.520 --> 07:22.640
if you pursue these virtues, I believe that a lot of what people are coming in for, if those

07:22.640 --> 07:27.760
individuals are not suffering from a particular disorder that you could diagnose via the DSM,

07:27.760 --> 07:36.000
I do believe that something like virtue cultivation could be a serious modality to really help, you

07:36.000 --> 07:42.880
know what, I'm trying to think what's the word that Aristotle uses in eudaimonia, to get to this

07:42.880 --> 07:46.640
eudaimonic state, right? And that's really the goal of all mental health counseling is you want

07:46.640 --> 07:51.360
the individual to reach this eudaimonic state, you want the individual to be happy, right?

07:52.480 --> 08:00.080
And I won't get into like the happiness that is more, well, it's the more profound, it's more

08:00.080 --> 08:04.640
joyful than it is happy, right? Eudaimonic, you want people to be joyful, and yeah, I do believe

08:04.640 --> 08:09.040
that one way that we can reach joy is by the cultivation of virtues, and so yes, your work,

08:09.680 --> 08:13.680
I think in a lot of what you've been doing with the Beaning Crisis and what you've been doing

08:13.680 --> 08:19.680
with After Sacrities and what you're doing in general is really in alignment with what I'm doing

08:19.680 --> 08:25.680
and I would hope to use your work and to pick your brain a lot, you know, now and in the future

08:25.680 --> 08:33.040
to help me with this effort. Wow, that's a very well-explicated and thoughtful answer.

08:33.840 --> 08:40.160
There's a lot in there. So I'm going to ask a question and it might sound like a challenge,

08:40.160 --> 08:47.840
but I honestly, it's not. So one thing that's happened in response to, and I agree with all the

08:47.840 --> 08:55.840
stats you were laying out, you know, the particulars might be move around a bit. I think the general

08:55.840 --> 09:02.160
point I think is well stated. So one of the ways in which there's been a response, and I know people

09:02.160 --> 09:10.480
that do this like Rick, Rick Rapetti, they've taken up philosophical counseling as a way of trying to

09:11.680 --> 09:16.720
address the people that are coming in not because, I mean the slogan is they're not pathological,

09:16.720 --> 09:23.280
they're confused and they're not sick. They're finding that they're being too foolish in their life

09:24.160 --> 09:31.200
and those are not the same thing. And of course, there's nothing that prevents them from both

09:31.200 --> 09:35.920
being comorbid either. Often you can have both and they're making each other worse

09:36.480 --> 09:44.320
in really obnoxious fashion for the person. So are you planning on getting any training

09:44.320 --> 09:48.560
in and incorporating the philosophical counseling into what you're doing because it sounds like

09:48.560 --> 09:53.360
it would also be helpful for you? Yeah, no, I've most definitely looked into it

09:54.080 --> 10:01.920
and I think it would be helpful. And I've already been tapped on the shoulder by a few to pursue

10:01.920 --> 10:10.000
things like, you know, become maybe like a union analyst or to, like you said, maybe journey down

10:10.000 --> 10:14.240
that avenue of what we would consider philosophical counseling. And I'm sure many people who are

10:14.240 --> 10:18.240
watching don't even realize that there might be like this very specific type of counseling. Yes,

10:18.240 --> 10:24.960
it is. Usually the individual who is the counselor usually has a higher degree in philosophy.

10:24.960 --> 10:31.360
Yes. And it's almost like this, you know, I always think, I tell people, many people this

10:31.360 --> 10:36.400
before, you know, I think the greatest counseling relationship that we've ever seen in human history

10:36.960 --> 10:42.320
has been the counseling relationship between Virgil and John today. I really can't believe that

10:42.320 --> 10:52.000
that is quite frankly the most beautiful vision of what a counselor should be. It's like, hey,

10:52.000 --> 10:59.440
I'm going to help you get here. Realize, though, that I can't go with you to that. I can't get to

10:59.440 --> 11:06.080
that same place that we need you to get. But I know that you need to get there. And I have to leave

11:06.080 --> 11:09.760
you behind. And it's going to be sad, right? When we terminate, that's like the counselor,

11:10.320 --> 11:15.680
counselor, when we terminate our relationship, it will be sad. And we have learned a lot from

11:15.680 --> 11:20.720
each other, and we may not ever see each other again. But, you know, realize that again,

11:20.720 --> 11:26.960
this relationship has been reformational, that it's like this beautiful, like,

11:26.960 --> 11:31.360
vocation that we have journeyed on together. But to answer your question more directly,

11:31.360 --> 11:37.440
yes, I have thought about pursuing it. But here's my only issue with that. I want Mike,

11:37.440 --> 11:40.640
I was talking, so it's actually funny, because I was actually approaching this question with my

11:40.640 --> 11:46.480
wife, literally last week, and I was like, hey, because, you know, it's all about the

11:46.480 --> 11:49.680
particularities. It's like, okay, well, there's some very practical things that we have to do,

11:49.680 --> 11:52.640
right? So like, I'm going to open up my own business. So you got to take out a small business

11:52.640 --> 11:57.280
loan and yada, yada, yada. So it actually does, you know, this is, it's not just a me decision,

11:57.280 --> 12:01.680
it's a family decision. And how is this going to affect my wife and my kid and all these things

12:01.760 --> 12:11.200
that we were talking. And my vision has always been working with very high insight in individuals

12:11.200 --> 12:16.000
with high insight, right? So individuals who possess high insight. And when you do philosophical

12:16.000 --> 12:20.960
counseling, you're usually working with individuals with high insight, because who is going to a

12:20.960 --> 12:26.560
philosophical counselor, other than that, other than the individual who has probably is somewhat

12:26.560 --> 12:34.240
learned in, you know, Western, more than likely, Western continental philosophy, right?

12:34.240 --> 12:39.920
And so I was telling her this. And, you know, she said, you know, very wise, she said, well,

12:39.920 --> 12:44.000
you're really just missing the mark then, at that point. I was like, what does that mean?

12:44.640 --> 12:51.600
She said, Joe, you know, you virtue cultivation is not just for the intelligentsia. It's not

12:51.600 --> 12:57.680
just for those in an academic side, right? Virtue cultivation sometimes is needed more

12:58.240 --> 13:04.560
by the individual who don't, who doesn't realize that you cultivate virtues. I mean,

13:04.560 --> 13:09.360
people don't even know if we were to go out on the, our respective cities sidewalks,

13:09.360 --> 13:15.200
we say, what's virtue? Who the hell would be able to, I mean, really, I have a hard time

13:15.200 --> 13:18.720
myself answering that without the help of great thinkers, right? Like,

13:19.680 --> 13:26.640
so, I mean, so it's not even like my, so I even sometimes have a difficult time buying the correct

13:26.640 --> 13:32.400
language that I have to rely on great thinkers of the past. So given that, I mean, stemming from

13:32.400 --> 13:39.040
that, who realizes that we have to cultivate it? People just think, Oh, this is, people have a

13:39.040 --> 13:46.000
very odd relationship with virtue, because they just, they just don't understand that it's a

13:46.080 --> 13:52.320
vocational call, right? That virtue, I believe that virtue truly operates in the beautiful. It's

13:52.320 --> 13:58.560
like, the beautiful is the car and virtue are the parts of the car. So they're very connected,

13:58.560 --> 14:02.720
but you can also make the distinction, right? So I'm not going to say my steering wheel is my car,

14:02.720 --> 14:07.360
but I will say, like, yeah, beauty is the car. And I do believe that virtue is the steering wheel,

14:07.360 --> 14:12.160
because they function similarly, right? Because the beauty and things that are beautiful,

14:13.120 --> 14:17.440
allow the individual, it's like one of the only things in our life that allows us

14:18.880 --> 14:25.760
to not be content with how things are, right? So it's like, we are not content with our lives,

14:26.560 --> 14:32.640
and, you know, philosophically, but even like, put that on like a lower rung of the scale,

14:32.640 --> 14:40.080
maybe I look at my bedroom and it's a mess and I'm like, why? So beauty really orients us

14:40.880 --> 14:47.680
towards the good, right? But it also allows us not to be content. And it calls us, right? Beauty

14:47.680 --> 14:56.400
calls us to achieve or go up a rung of understanding and seeing reality more vividly. And that's what

14:56.400 --> 15:01.360
virtue does too. So this is why I really do believe that- Yeah, I agree. That's a very platonic argument

15:01.360 --> 15:07.120
you just made. Very platonic. That's a very platonic argument you just made. Yeah. Right, exactly.

15:07.680 --> 15:15.040
And, you know, I do believe that, you know, Henri de Lubach, Ray, talks about a saturated

15:15.040 --> 15:21.360
phenomena. And I do believe that, I believe that virtue is also operating as a saturated phenomena.

15:22.400 --> 15:28.800
Again, I do believe that virtue, again, being connected with beauty operates in the erotic,

15:28.800 --> 15:35.120
because it's something that calls, it's something that pulls you. It's something that is insightful.

15:35.120 --> 15:41.120
And, you know, I once read this great book, I don't know if, I mean, knowing that you have

15:41.120 --> 15:47.360
spent much time studying Buddhist philosophy, I read this great book in college once upon a time,

15:47.360 --> 15:51.360
because I also, I was a religious studies major, but most of my time was never actually spending,

15:52.480 --> 15:57.200
well, I was never taking Christian classes, I was taking Buddhist classes. And I read this book

15:57.200 --> 16:02.000
called Alone with Others by Stephen Batchelor. Yeah, yeah, I teach that book. Oh, do you? Okay,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.920
yeah. I taught that book for years. I've met Stephen and had dinner with him. Yeah.

16:06.720 --> 16:13.040
It's a great book. And I also, and again, it's not nothing, it's nothing about the book, by the

16:13.040 --> 16:19.600
way, is about, you know, it's mostly on, you know, Buddhist, a particular Buddhist philosopher,

16:19.600 --> 16:24.400
a Buddhist philosopher's connection with Martin Heidegger. But the book is called Alone with Others.

16:24.400 --> 16:31.760
And that's another way I think that virtue is that virtue functions is that it's an individual

16:31.760 --> 16:38.880
pursuit, but you aren't going to realize it unless it's practiced with others, right? So.

16:39.840 --> 16:48.320
So let me make sure I'm not losing the thread here. So you're, you took a look at philosophical

16:48.320 --> 16:53.440
counseling, and there was an appeal there, but your wife said something very insightful about

16:54.000 --> 16:58.720
what, you know, maybe the what you're called to is to bring virtue to people who are not

16:58.720 --> 17:04.160
awakened to the quest for virtue. And you want to learn how to awaken them. And one of the functions

17:04.160 --> 17:11.840
of beauty is to awaken them to the quest. And then, and, and, and, and this, yeah, and beauty is

17:11.840 --> 17:16.960
one of virtue is one of these alone with others. We, you know, it's a virtue if you have Gaiji's

17:16.960 --> 17:21.680
ring and you're alone, but it's because you're responsible to other people. I get all that

17:21.680 --> 17:28.160
connection. And that was very eloquent. So how does this beautification, how would the beautification

17:28.240 --> 17:34.560
and the awakening to virtue come into sort of the psychotherapeutic practice? Now, first of all,

17:34.560 --> 17:39.040
I give you the caveat. Like if somebody, if somebody's coming in disordered pathological,

17:39.040 --> 17:43.200
that, that has to be, that's exigent. That has to be addressed and dealt with. We're talking about

17:43.200 --> 17:47.760
this other group, the people that are coming in existentially confused, meaning crisis. So

17:49.200 --> 17:55.920
tell me what, how you're like, how you're, this is where a lot of my thoughts are,

17:55.920 --> 18:01.520
I'm ruminating on most of these. So if my answer isn't as developed, please, you know, show me some

18:01.520 --> 18:08.720
compassion, but I'll, I'll, I'll, of course, of course, of course. I was in my own. So I see, you

18:08.720 --> 18:14.960
know, part of my program is that, and I think every good counselor, every good psychotherapist

18:14.960 --> 18:20.240
should see their own psychotherapy. Oh, totally. Totally. I, I, I'm very critical of people who

18:20.240 --> 18:25.600
practice, who have never gone through therapy. Right. It's odd. Um, it's like being a priest,

18:25.600 --> 18:33.120
but never going to mass. Yeah. And it's funny. I mean, I don't, I don't really mean to

18:34.960 --> 18:39.920
make this very direct joke, but as a Catholic, right? Sorry. One thing I struggle with, I think

18:39.920 --> 18:45.840
I would struggle with this without, without being Catholic or not, but I have a lot of guilt,

18:45.840 --> 18:52.640
right? That's one thing that I have in me. And I don't, and I work, get into my,

18:52.640 --> 18:57.680
getting into my, my particular sessions, I'm trying to figure out, I'm on my own quest right now,

18:58.560 --> 19:04.560
of figuring out if this guilt is a personality trait, where this guilt comes from, why do I have

19:04.560 --> 19:10.960
this guilt? And it's also yesterday, I had a great, I had a great realization, but it was also very

19:11.040 --> 19:19.600
embarrassing realization that, you know, a lot of my identity, a lot of, a lot of my identity that I

19:19.600 --> 19:25.280
exude is still the identity that I had, you know, when I was in middle school. And that's very

19:25.280 --> 19:30.160
embarrassing, right? But it's like, it's like, it's like these characteristics, these personal,

19:30.160 --> 19:35.200
personality characteristics that I obviously just haven't processed correctly. Right. And they, and

19:35.680 --> 19:42.480
they're not bad, and they don't necessarily get in the way, but they make me for a lot of reasons

19:42.480 --> 19:46.960
without getting into my psychology, right? They, I have a lot of guilt, like I said, so I feel guilty

19:46.960 --> 19:51.760
for, why am I telling you this? Well, I'm telling you this because I think with people of high insight

19:51.760 --> 19:55.520
who would come in for this particular type of counseling, maybe something that they would

19:55.520 --> 20:02.640
also feel ashamed or guilt. And so usually high insightful people will do something, something

20:02.640 --> 20:10.480
very menial, right? Could be menial. Like I lied to my spouse about, I don't know. I mean, maybe

20:10.480 --> 20:18.400
I lied about how many beers I had at the party, or I don't know, maybe, maybe I, maybe I watched

20:18.400 --> 20:24.320
pornography and I feel really bad about that. Maybe I bullied a friend, I jibbed a friend a

20:24.320 --> 20:29.040
little too hard, you know, when we were, you know, in our, in our group text message, or, and you

20:29.040 --> 20:38.080
could think of whatever, you know, I feel guilt. Okay. And then, you know, unfortunately, nowadays,

20:38.080 --> 20:43.600
I mean, how everyone who feels guilt, like four times in a week, or am I a narcissist? Am I this?

20:43.600 --> 20:49.120
Am I, no, no, no, let's, let's, let's take deep breath and let's, let's take this. What if it's

20:49.120 --> 20:58.000
not guilt? What if it's not shame that you're experiencing? What if, again, because like virtue

20:58.000 --> 21:04.640
is a call, right? It's something that calls you. So what if virtue was a call? And what if the fact

21:04.640 --> 21:10.960
that you were able to admit to me that you lied to your wife, or you did something dishonest,

21:10.960 --> 21:18.880
you did something that wasn't courageous, you did something, you know, you did, you did something

21:18.880 --> 21:23.120
again, you just didn't enjoy the fact that you're able to sit here in a counseling session and tell

21:23.120 --> 21:30.000
me that you have guilt and that you didn't enjoy it. Maybe that's not guilt at all. And maybe

21:30.000 --> 21:35.600
that's your conscious telling you, or maybe that's virtue, right, trying to signal to you

21:36.320 --> 21:43.040
that you should pursue this further. The fact that you were able to feel that the fact that you

21:43.040 --> 21:48.320
knew that it was wrong to lie, the fact that it was the fact that, you know, you were being

21:48.400 --> 21:54.720
deceptive, that you were being surreptitious. That insight right there might allow you to

21:54.720 --> 22:01.920
realize that, no, no, I don't need to feel guilty, but the fact that I was cognizant of my fault,

22:03.200 --> 22:09.920
maybe that's actually virtue communicating with me and inviting me to indulge in a deeper

22:09.920 --> 22:16.720
relationship with virtue. Well, I see. I see. So you're reframing it. It's very

22:16.800 --> 22:22.320
high agarient, which Stephen would love, Stephen Bachelor. Yeah. You know, the conscience is,

22:23.760 --> 22:27.680
there's an existential version of conscience. There's a psychological version of conscience,

22:27.680 --> 22:33.520
which is basically your internalization of certain norms. And you punish yourself as a way of

22:33.520 --> 22:37.760
redirecting your behavior, guilt and shame. They're not the same thing, but they're sort of working.

22:38.400 --> 22:45.840
But then there's an existential sense where conscience is the call to authenticity. You're

22:45.840 --> 22:52.080
saying conscience could be understood as the call to virtue. So where does the beauty come in? Is

22:52.080 --> 22:59.920
that trying to see the beauty of the life that you could be called to? Is that the idea? Yeah,

22:59.920 --> 23:10.160
that's precisely it. And even trying to, you know, again, like, I think if you pursue and

23:11.120 --> 23:17.040
try to cultivate and therefore try to live a virtuous life, I do think, yeah, in that process,

23:17.040 --> 23:21.760
I mean, life automatically becomes more beautiful, right? So what's a more beautiful vision of life

23:21.760 --> 23:27.360
that I'll complete as hard as it could be a complete honest relationship with your wife or

23:27.360 --> 23:31.280
dishonest relationship with your wife? And what's more beautiful, right? What's a higher form of

23:31.280 --> 23:36.880
that? Right. So yeah. So yes, what you said precisely. Oh, that's very interesting.

23:37.520 --> 23:43.680
So like, yeah, I could see how a lot of the work that I do would be relevant to that project.

23:44.320 --> 23:53.840
And so how does, you know, the truth, the truth of the beautiful David Chindler,

23:53.840 --> 23:58.880
who I get to talk to, you know, these are the transcendentals. They're the transcendentals

23:58.880 --> 24:05.520
because they apply universally across domains. But the idea is their ultimate unity is in

24:06.160 --> 24:14.880
is in the one or God, your Catholic, so I'll say God for your benefit. How does that sense of the

24:14.880 --> 24:20.880
transcendence, you know, Plato, the symposium, the cult of the love of virtue is not the final love,

24:20.880 --> 24:27.680
we move beyond that to the love of the source of intelligibility or the possibility of virtue,

24:30.000 --> 24:33.600
the ground of being, the ground of life, the ground of wisdom, that sort of

24:34.560 --> 24:42.320
vision that's articulated in Aquinas or Maximus. How does, so now given all of that sort of

24:43.440 --> 24:46.880
explication, how does God show up in this for you? Yeah, I mean,

24:48.560 --> 24:54.160
you're Catholic, so it's fair to re-ask that question, I think. 100% it's fair. So again, like,

24:55.760 --> 24:59.760
this is why I bring up, this is why I say that Dante and Virgil is such a good model.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.400
It's, you know, in a counseling session, I don't know if I would, I mean,

25:04.400 --> 25:10.960
unless the individual is comfortable with bringing it up, you know, then I would talk about God, but

25:12.400 --> 25:17.760
yeah, well, you, I mean, you almost, I think and challenge me and push me further, but I really

25:17.760 --> 25:22.080
almost think that, you know, you gave the answer in your question though. And when it's, you know,

25:23.040 --> 25:30.480
all these things are in submission to the one, right? Virtue and beauty and the true and the good.

25:30.480 --> 25:35.440
And I don't, you know what, I'm having a hard time trying to order three transcendentals in my own

25:35.440 --> 25:40.000
life. I would love to get your take on that. It's like, you know, what's, it's like, what's, you

25:40.000 --> 25:44.560
know, everyone tries to say, oh, you pursue the good and that opens up the beautiful and that

25:44.560 --> 25:51.040
gives you truth. I don't necessarily think that it matters how you orient the three transcendentals

25:51.040 --> 25:57.680
for me personally. I believe, like I said, that beauty is the most approachable because, yeah,

25:57.680 --> 26:02.080
that's what Plato thought, because beauty is the one that reaches so readily and obviously into the

26:02.080 --> 26:09.360
sensual aspect of our being in the way that truth and goodness don't. We can see and touch beauty

26:09.360 --> 26:15.600
in a way in which we can see and not, we cannot see and cannot touch truth and goodness. So I think

26:16.560 --> 26:21.440
David Gendo talks about it as, what is it? I might get it wrong, but something like the primacy

26:21.440 --> 26:29.120
of beauty, it comes first, but the centrality of truth and then I think the ultimacy of goodness,

26:29.120 --> 26:33.840
or it could be those two the other way around, but they each have a superlative, but in different

26:33.840 --> 26:44.480
ways. I think, I think speaking temporally, I think beauty comes first. I saw, but what we have to

26:44.480 --> 26:49.760
remember is to not, and human beings have a proclivity to this, this error. We have, we shouldn't

26:49.760 --> 26:54.800
confuse, that's what David's trying to address. We shouldn't confuse temporal priority with

26:54.800 --> 27:00.320
ontological priority. Just because beauty comes first doesn't mean it's the first of the transcendentals,

27:01.360 --> 27:09.680
right? They're all first in different ways. Beauty is temporally first. I think the true is

27:10.240 --> 27:16.080
central in some way, but they have different priorities. And I, like I say, kind of remember

27:16.080 --> 27:23.840
which way David does it. It's really good. His work on that on, on the primacy of beauty,

27:23.840 --> 27:31.760
and then he talks about primacy, centrality, and ultimacy. And so I think truth is the ultimate

27:31.760 --> 27:36.560
actually, and goodness is the, is the central, but I could, I could have a look around. But that's

27:36.560 --> 27:42.480
because I have a slightly different notion of goodness is perhaps making me confused. So I'm

27:42.480 --> 27:48.000
just admitting I'm confused. But the point, the point that I'm not confused about that I think

27:48.000 --> 27:54.880
is well taken is to not, is to recognize that each transcendental is ultimate, but in a different

27:54.880 --> 27:59.760
way. Each, right? So there's, there's firstness and there's centrality and there's ultimacy.

28:00.400 --> 28:06.320
These are all superlatives, but in fundamental different ways. And just don't, so learn to

28:06.560 --> 28:12.160
differentiate the different ways in which they're ultimate, but also learn to not confuse them

28:13.360 --> 28:19.520
and give each one its proper due. It's profound. Yeah. And I, you know, just because of my background,

28:20.080 --> 28:28.480
you know, I, my, my undergraduate degree is in art history and religious studies. My master's work

28:28.480 --> 28:33.840
is working with my favorite Catholic theologian, Von Balthasar. So obviously,

28:34.160 --> 28:42.480
yeah, you've got to read some Schindler. He is the person that has made Balthasar

28:43.120 --> 28:50.480
like accessible and I think clearer. And also he's developed. David's just done amazing work

28:50.480 --> 28:56.800
developing beyond Von. And I mean that in the way a good student goes beyond their teacher,

28:56.800 --> 29:02.880
but he's gone beyond Balthasar in just profound ways. Of course. Oh, this is great. Okay. This

29:02.880 --> 29:08.800
is great. I need, oh man. Okay. Yeah. Well, now I have something to do. I do want to say one thing

29:08.800 --> 29:12.080
though, back to your question about, you know, where is the one and where does God come in an

29:12.080 --> 29:21.280
office? Yes, please. This makes me a bad Catholic. I'm sure. And I'm, I'm worried about, sometimes

29:21.280 --> 29:27.600
like, yeah, I always have a hard time. I always have a hard time trying to know, or I have a hard

29:27.600 --> 29:35.440
time knowing where I fit in in these circles. I watched that video that you and Paul Bander Clay

29:35.440 --> 29:40.240
and Jonathan Peugeot, and forgive me, I don't remember the woman's name. I had, that was the

29:40.240 --> 29:45.280
first time I interacted with her virtually. What was her, what's her name? Who's on? You did,

29:45.280 --> 29:52.400
I'm sorry, let me give you the title first. On a Spiritual Home, it was on. Oh, that's Catherine.

29:52.480 --> 29:59.280
Sure. Yeah. And there was John Van Dink was there as well. Yes. Wonderful. Well, it's kind of funny

29:59.280 --> 30:04.000
because, you know, as someone, I mean, obviously as someone who's Catholic, I still somewhat don't

30:04.000 --> 30:08.240
feel that I have a spiritual home. And the reason why I preface this is this. In my counseling,

30:08.240 --> 30:16.560
like, you know, my goal is never to make in life. In life, this is very hard to admit. I'm not

30:16.560 --> 30:21.440
necessarily concerned with converting people to Catholicism. I don't think you should be when

30:21.440 --> 30:27.840
you're in therapy. I think that's just, I think that's just. Even personally, I'm not necessarily,

30:27.840 --> 30:33.360
you know, and I, and that's for my own personal reasons. And that's because, you know, I'm basically

30:33.360 --> 30:39.280
not, I mean, I'm a cradle Catholic, but I'm also a revert. And I had, you know, a long bout with

30:39.280 --> 30:46.000
atheism. And I, as I just expressed to you, I mostly studied Buddhist philosophy and undergrad,

30:46.000 --> 30:54.880
and deep, deep compassion for anyone who has that proclivity. And so it's not my goal to make

30:54.880 --> 31:01.280
any one Catholic, but it is my goal to, and I'm not a relativist, I want to make that very, very,

31:01.280 --> 31:12.320
very. It is my goal, though, to unite the individual with the one God, right. And I won't

31:12.320 --> 31:17.440
necessarily get into the, yeah, I don't understand what I just said was loaded, because then you

31:17.440 --> 31:22.800
can, again, you can, oh, what is he saying that, you know, what he's, what he's saying is that

31:22.800 --> 31:28.720
like a relative, relativist thought, and I don't necessarily want to get into my, my spirituality,

31:29.920 --> 31:35.760
or, you know, things that I subscribe to, I really enjoy the more mystical teachings of Catholicism.

31:35.760 --> 31:42.800
But yeah, it's never my goal to make anyone anything. My goal is the only, the only goal I

31:42.800 --> 31:49.200
have is, like I stated before, is to help the individual pursue the path to eudaimonia, right.

31:49.200 --> 31:55.440
And that's what I want to do. So I think that's a good clarification and specification. So let me

31:55.440 --> 32:01.680
make my question more precise than my question is, well, I first of all, proposal, I propose that

32:02.480 --> 32:13.600
getting people into right orientation towards the one towards ultimacy is how you can best help them

32:14.880 --> 32:20.240
explicate, articulate, and respond to their, and here I'm being till it, their ultimate concerns,

32:20.240 --> 32:27.360
and that part of what is underneath their confusion is very often they are confused about

32:27.360 --> 32:32.560
what they ultimately care about. That's one part of the confusion. The other can be what is ultimate

32:32.560 --> 32:37.520
such that I should care about it as ultimate is another thing that people are often confused

32:37.520 --> 32:42.160
about. We often pursue evil, not because we're pursuing evil, but because we pursue a lesser

32:42.160 --> 32:48.160
good at the expense of a greater good. Oh, amen. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So what I, what I meant was,

32:48.160 --> 32:52.960
you know, how, yes, I get it, you're not proselytizing, you're not trying to surreptitiously convert

32:52.960 --> 32:58.240
people. That would be duplicitous. I think it would be vicious in fact. But there's a sense in

32:58.240 --> 33:02.880
which if what we're talking about, again, not, not the pathological people, but the deeply confused

33:02.880 --> 33:08.240
people, we're trying to bring them clarity, then I think the orientation towards, you know, what's

33:08.240 --> 33:14.720
real, what's most real, and how well connected am I to it is a fundamental question about meaning

33:14.720 --> 33:19.440
in life. Of course. And that's where you're, I mean, and that's exactly where your specific

33:19.440 --> 33:25.120
project comes in. And it's like, okay, but now how do I make this a psychological modality?

33:25.120 --> 33:29.040
Right. I don't sit them down. Hey, in today's session, we're going to watch episode four of

33:29.040 --> 33:35.520
the meeting. Of course. That would be utterly ridiculous. That sounds like a weird sitcom to

33:35.520 --> 33:42.000
that could be done or something. Yeah. Right. Um, but it's again, it's like, yeah, how do I

33:42.640 --> 33:48.880
distill? And again, I'm not, and you know this, you are not the only individual who has written

33:48.960 --> 33:56.560
or thought about this extensively, right? So it's not just you. It's, it's, it's you in

33:58.480 --> 34:03.360
accompaniment with other great thinkers. It's you in accompaniment with spiritual teachers. It's

34:03.360 --> 34:10.720
you in accompaniment with simply just like already like empirically proven psychotherapeutic

34:10.720 --> 34:17.120
practices, right? So it's like, and it's also in company with my, with my own, uh, with, with,

34:17.120 --> 34:24.320
with who I am as a person, right? Yeah. So it's like, how do I put it? How do I, how do I get all,

34:24.320 --> 34:29.680
all of us to converge? How do I, how do I create this tapestry of all these voices?

34:29.680 --> 34:34.240
And that's what's difficult because it can't just be, right? So this is the thing. I mean,

34:34.240 --> 34:39.360
counseling is not what we are seeing on YouTube, right? This is not, I mean, this is, this, this,

34:39.360 --> 34:44.480
in a way, this is nice. Um, and I've had many counseling sessions where it has just been a

34:44.480 --> 34:51.760
dialogue. Um, but how do we transform the dialogue? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's the question

34:51.760 --> 34:56.160
that I'm, I'm, I'm struggling with quite frankly. I mean, so again, there's more skin in the game

34:56.160 --> 35:01.200
because this is not just a theoretical, I'm not just like having this conversation with you,

35:01.200 --> 35:06.000
just a, you know, kill an hour. It's like, no, this is quite frankly, like a livelihood that I

35:06.000 --> 35:12.080
might have. Right. This is, this is also, this has economic implications, right? Yeah. I get it.

35:12.080 --> 35:16.160
So it's like, well, what's the model that, what, what's the model? And so yeah, this is the thing

35:16.160 --> 35:21.920
that I'm, I'm, I'm tirelessly thinking about every day. And it's like, yeah, I'm breathing a lot,

35:21.920 --> 35:25.840
and I'm thinking a lot, and I'm reflecting a lot, and I'm watching a lot.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.640
I want to know this when, when, like, I, I'm not demanding it now. I get it. It's a

35:30.640 --> 35:36.720
work in progress. So, so, but, so don't mistake my, but like, I want, I like, I want to, I,

35:37.680 --> 35:42.320
I want notes from the front or something. I want to know, like, how this is work,

35:42.320 --> 35:47.200
how you are doing that, how you're translating that into, this is very important. I mean,

35:49.760 --> 35:52.960
I mean, part of what the Verveki Foundation is trying to do is collect,

35:54.080 --> 35:58.800
you know, relevant psychotherapists and counselors and philosophical counselors who can deal with

35:58.800 --> 36:04.160
people who are wrestling with not just sort of the pedagogical struggles of taking on

36:04.160 --> 36:10.480
an ecology practices, but, you know, a therapeutic slash existential dimension. So, you know,

36:10.480 --> 36:14.960
let me interrupt you right there, even. So, I mean, part of it is also just not trying to reinvent

36:14.960 --> 36:20.960
the wheel. Right. Yeah. We have, I mean, who the hell am I? Not, not that much, right? Who the hell

36:20.960 --> 36:28.880
am I to say I'm going to create this new psychotherapeutic model, right? No. How am I going to have,

36:29.200 --> 36:35.040
how am I, how am I going to personally put my ego aside for a second? And I'm going to submit

36:35.040 --> 36:42.720
myself to the great thinkers, to visionaries of the past. And I, again, I, I interact with them,

36:43.520 --> 36:47.840
and I transcend time and space, and they come into that session. So it's like, yeah, it's like,

36:47.840 --> 36:55.200
how do we, okay, so part of it is I'm wrestling with kind of this hybrid CBT existential model,

36:55.200 --> 37:00.480
because there is, because there, there, you do need to involve some type of cognitive behavioral

37:00.480 --> 37:07.120
therapy. And of course, people reframing abilities, you have to. Exactly. Because you can give everyone

37:07.120 --> 37:12.000
the existential jargon, and someone's going to say, you know, you, you can talk about, you know,

37:12.000 --> 37:17.200
like I said, use I, you just throw out, like it's like a word box, like, oh yeah, I the relationship,

37:17.200 --> 37:24.960
or yeah, whatever, like, you can't do that unless you have to first get the individual to a

37:24.960 --> 37:29.200
place of insight, they weren't there. It wasn't there before, right? And the only way you can get

37:29.200 --> 37:38.560
there is through the, you know, and we should be, we should be in, we should have much gratitude

37:38.560 --> 37:45.200
towards the individuals who really developed the CBT model. And I do believe, you know, one thing,

37:45.200 --> 37:50.240
it's funny, I talked about never knowing where my footing is, it's like, I, yeah, I tend to,

37:51.120 --> 37:58.560
in the psychological circles, I tend to hang out with the more existential psychologists,

37:58.560 --> 38:04.240
right? There's a lot of like good existential psychology happening right now. Even from,

38:04.880 --> 38:14.320
you know, my institution where I'm at, Clay Rutledge over at Dakota, he's doing a lot of great work in

38:14.400 --> 38:22.400
terror management and nostalgia and just more existential things that you could actually trickle

38:22.400 --> 38:29.360
down to using that as like a therapeutic modality. But, so what I'm getting at is that you have the

38:29.360 --> 38:35.280
existentialists on one side and just being like, sometimes it's weird how we just like groupthink,

38:35.280 --> 38:40.240
they're like, no, this, you know, the people who subscribe to CBT, that's just a bunch of bullshit.

38:40.240 --> 38:45.440
It's like, no, it's not just a bunch, I mean, it can't be a bunch of bullshit. It's not just that,

38:45.440 --> 38:51.120
it's not that simplistic. And the evidence is the effectiveness of CBT is going down,

38:51.120 --> 38:57.760
because as it's been abstracted and extracted from therapists who had a much broader philosophical

38:57.760 --> 39:03.040
base and could bring in and address existential issues and sapiential having to do with wisdom

39:03.040 --> 39:07.760
and virtue issues. Yeah, when you take it out, you abstract it, you just have it as a separate

39:07.760 --> 39:13.440
method. Like it looks like it's effectiveness as an evidence-based therapy is actually going down.

39:14.800 --> 39:19.920
There's a lot of reasons for that. And just like the, yeah, like, it's unfortunate how much

39:20.720 --> 39:27.840
your basic, sorry, your average clinician who is working in the modality of CBT

39:28.880 --> 39:35.760
might not actually have a keen of an eye. And they might not understand CBT. So what ends up

39:35.760 --> 39:40.000
happening is you just, you go back to third grade vocab class and you just get a work.

39:41.600 --> 39:49.200
I have a stronger critique. I think, yeah, yeah, it's, I think the way to address this

39:50.160 --> 39:56.240
is that CBT and other people have said this, Robinson and others, CBT needs to be resituated

39:56.240 --> 40:05.280
into, inside stoicism, which it was derived, because what needs to be offered is not a technique,

40:05.280 --> 40:10.160
but the cultivation of virtue within the aspiration to a good life. And that's what's

40:10.160 --> 40:17.280
missing from CBT as a framework right now. So I think CBT was more effective. You know, the people

40:17.280 --> 40:24.800
who invented it were deeply educated with stoicism, right? And then that has fallen away

40:25.600 --> 40:29.600
because of psychology's proclivity to forget its philosophical past.

40:29.600 --> 40:34.880
Oh, amen. And that's why I said, that's why, you know, to get to the point or to get to the

40:34.880 --> 40:43.280
genesis of this subconversation. Yeah, you have to bring in the existential psychotherapeutic

40:43.280 --> 40:50.000
techniques are the most approachable of, you know, that side of the coin. So you do need to have this

40:50.000 --> 40:57.040
blend of, you know, cog and existentialism. And you need to blend these two together. And I think

40:57.440 --> 41:06.960
I personally think if this, if this enmeshing happens, then this is, then we can borrow that

41:07.840 --> 41:11.840
and use that for this vision of counseling that I've been discussing.

41:11.840 --> 41:20.720
Interesting, interesting. So I mean, virtues often have to do with two other things, emotions. So

41:21.200 --> 41:27.760
I mean, I've done training also in EFT, Emotional Public Policy, and also inter-conflict and

41:28.320 --> 41:34.720
inter-parts work by GIFS and other things are really good for learning how to also internalize

41:34.720 --> 41:40.720
the dialogue inside the psyche and not always make it. So I'm wondering, do you think those

41:40.720 --> 41:46.240
other two, I mean, I don't want to send you on an education. By the way, Joe, just, you know,

41:47.200 --> 41:53.280
get educated on this for the next 20 years and then, but it seems to me, I guess I'm making an

41:53.280 --> 41:59.440
argument. I agree totally with the proposal of integrating CBT and existentialism and therefore

41:59.440 --> 42:07.040
getting something back to something like stoicism. But we also know, you know, stoicism and should

42:07.040 --> 42:12.880
be put into dialogue with Buddhism because all kinds of evidence that combining CBT and

42:12.880 --> 42:19.440
mindfulness together is synergistically helpful. Right. So I'm just wondering, like, is it, you

42:19.440 --> 42:24.160
know, and then you want the inner dialogue work to overcome inner conflict and how to internalize

42:24.160 --> 42:30.480
dialogue and IFS is good for that. And then dealing with emotions is a very, very important

42:30.480 --> 42:34.720
part of call to virtue. I mean, Aristotle said, you know, it's not about being angry or not,

42:34.720 --> 42:38.800
it's being angry at the right time for the right reasons to the right degree for the right person.

42:39.600 --> 42:45.680
Yeah. And this is where, you know, a lot, you know, I'm even thinking about now and forgive

42:45.680 --> 42:49.760
me if I don't directly answer your question, but now I'm just, you know, brainstorming and just,

42:49.760 --> 42:53.600
again, they're not, they're not, again, please have compassion for me because they're not the

42:53.600 --> 42:57.280
most, they're not developed thoughts yet because I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about this.

42:57.280 --> 43:04.640
And so it's been like, you know, how, to what effect will, to what effect does psycho education

43:04.720 --> 43:13.440
even have, like this type of therapy? It's like, you know, you said, I forget exactly,

43:15.200 --> 43:19.440
I know you talked about mindfulness, but even just like the differentiation between teaching

43:19.440 --> 43:25.360
someone what's the difference, the difference between mindfulness and contemplation meditation.

43:25.360 --> 43:29.840
Meditation, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. So it's like, how often do we conflate these and we conflate

43:29.840 --> 43:34.960
these and then we think that, and it's just confused. So if we don't understand the meaning

43:34.960 --> 43:40.480
of words that we use, well, then we have, we don't understand our very selves because like,

43:40.480 --> 43:45.680
the person is like a word. I mean, we are like letters. I mean, it's all these things are connected,

43:45.680 --> 43:52.640
right? My friend Spencer Clayton, he writes about this in his newest book. And he talks about how

43:54.080 --> 43:59.440
one thing that's been lost is the meaning of the meaning of words, right? I mean,

44:00.240 --> 44:03.520
structuralists. So, you know, we think that words can mean whatever the hell they want,

44:03.520 --> 44:09.920
but it's like, no, like these, these things, these symbols engender something, right? And,

44:10.560 --> 44:17.200
and once we believe that they don't, well, then we get in a weird, really weird place. And, okay,

44:17.200 --> 44:24.080
so how are we like letters then? Or how are we like words? Like, well, our forms engender something.

44:24.080 --> 44:29.360
And if we believe that they don't engender something real or true, or how about this,

44:29.360 --> 44:36.240
that we all engender possibly the same thing, getting back to the notion of the one to God.

44:36.240 --> 44:41.120
But when we stop believing this, we get into really weird places. And it's so funny that you

44:41.120 --> 44:48.880
brought up stoicism because I was thinking about how, you know, the Stoics naturally, and again,

44:48.960 --> 44:53.920
even with the Buddhists, right? So the Stoics, what's, you know, you take a Stoic and you can

44:53.920 --> 45:00.000
naturally start ushering them into the Christian ethic, right? It's so, it's, it's, it's a, it's

45:00.000 --> 45:05.040
not easy, but you know, you do it via Neil Platonism. That's how you do it. Right. And so,

45:06.640 --> 45:11.840
yeah, I mean, so, because, because in stoicism, it's obviously, I mean, people nowadays,

45:11.840 --> 45:15.120
especially individuals who might be going to counseling, who aren't necessarily religious,

45:15.120 --> 45:20.880
right? Taking those more Stoic practice, people are going to, people are going to automatically

45:20.880 --> 45:28.240
feel more comfortable. Yes, very much. Yeah. Rather than if they begin to sniff that,

45:28.240 --> 45:33.200
oh, what you're saying, I remember kind of hearing a very watered down version of that sometime in,

45:33.200 --> 45:41.280
like, in Christian school, or that's mildly religious. Right. So, yeah, I, it's, yes, it's,

45:41.280 --> 45:47.120
it's trying to be as approachable as possible. But no, you, when you were talking about, you know,

45:47.120 --> 45:52.720
the regulations of emotions and trying to figure out, I mean, yes, that, I think that that very

45:52.720 --> 45:59.600
much so is going to be a big part of this. Again, it's just like, and I, and part of this conversation,

45:59.600 --> 46:04.800
which I didn't necessarily expect it to be, but I'm really happy it isn't, it's trying, it's trying

46:04.800 --> 46:11.920
to talk with, you know, individuals. I mean, so I'm also talking next Thursday on a busy schedule.

46:11.920 --> 46:16.960
Her name is Nancy Snow. I don't know if you're familiar with her work. Nancy Snow? No, sorry.

46:17.760 --> 46:21.840
No, it's fine. And so I wasn't that familiar with her work either until just due my own

46:21.840 --> 46:26.080
perspective. So Nancy Snow is now at the University of Kansas, but she previously was at the University

46:26.080 --> 46:33.120
of Oklahoma. And so from 2000, from 2015 to 2018, Nancy in collaboration with

46:34.000 --> 46:40.480
other academics in the psychological field, they held experience, experiments just on, like,

46:40.480 --> 46:47.040
on this topic of virtue cultivation, how to, yeah, how to, and I'm so sorry, I don't have the exact

46:47.040 --> 46:53.760
name, but you should look her up after this is Nancy, Nancy Snow. And what their goal was in

46:53.760 --> 47:04.320
this three-year project was to discuss how you can use virtue cultivation. Can we make this,

47:04.320 --> 47:08.560
can we give this like some empirical backing, right? Because no one in the psychological field

47:08.560 --> 47:12.880
is going to care if you don't have empirical backing. Yeah. So yeah, part of it is having

47:12.880 --> 47:20.560
conversations like with you next week, Professor Snow. And hopefully what I end up doing is

47:20.720 --> 47:27.760
I, I take all these voices and I, like I said, I put everyone into accompaniment.

47:29.440 --> 47:34.480
And, you know, maybe we'll talk in the future. I don't know. But I'd like to, I'd like to know when,

47:35.120 --> 47:40.160
when you find your voice from all of these voices, I'd like to know what that was like,

47:40.160 --> 47:48.160
and what, how you did it, and what is properly idiosyncratic to you and what is properly

47:48.160 --> 47:50.800
charitable with other people. Yeah, it's very much like to know that.

47:52.800 --> 47:56.880
Yeah. So we're, we're on the journey together, I guess, you know, we're, and that's, and that's

47:56.880 --> 48:06.080
the really beautiful thing. So yeah, you know, and, you know, I did it. I, this, I'm kind of like,

48:06.080 --> 48:11.520
you know, going off the path a little bit. I didn't want to ask you a question though that I've

48:11.520 --> 48:16.880
been thinking about. I was just going to say, I think we should turn things over to you now asking

48:16.960 --> 48:25.200
me questions. Okay, let's do that. Okay. So how about this? We'll probably stay on this path.

48:25.200 --> 48:30.000
Well, I have a couple of questions I'm going to ask you about virtue and about play and about

48:30.000 --> 48:35.040
male and female virtue. And I'm going to incorporate Jung in that. I'm going to incorporate play in that.

48:35.040 --> 48:41.040
So I'll ask you some questions. But we're still going to be on the same. Yeah, if that's okay.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.400
With all that being said, real quick, just to, just to answer the question,

48:46.400 --> 48:51.840
what would you say is the gist of your intellectual project? Because you do so much.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.280
What are you trying to, what are you really trying to,

48:59.200 --> 49:03.280
what are you trying to achieve? What do you want people to take away?

49:03.760 --> 49:17.040
I want people to recover, how to cultivate meaning in life and wisdom. So they have wise meaning

49:17.040 --> 49:25.360
and meaningful wisdom, such that they can fall in love with beauty, truth and goodness, and

49:25.360 --> 49:30.640
ultimately fall in love with being again, and continue to do so for the rest of their lives.

49:34.000 --> 49:43.120
Real quick endeavor, right? I appreciate that. Thank you. And I will say, I mean, so

49:46.240 --> 49:49.840
you're getting bigger and bigger. This is, I just thought of this question now, but you know,

49:49.840 --> 49:58.480
and your pursuit is truly the most noble of pursuits. And your voice is being heard by many

49:58.480 --> 50:03.280
and you're helping out a lot of people. Has that hit you yet? Is that hitting you now that you are

50:03.280 --> 50:09.360
getting, that you, you're, you're gaining some type of what we would probably consider celebrity

50:09.360 --> 50:14.400
status, right? You're, you're probably getting more into the public intellectual sphere, probably

50:14.400 --> 50:23.760
that you ever thought you were ever going to get into, I'm guessing. Very, very mixed.

50:24.720 --> 50:32.560
One part of me is deeply grateful and I take great pains to demonstrate and to

50:33.440 --> 50:38.560
point out that there's, this is not me alone. This is very much a lot of people that I'm

50:38.560 --> 50:45.760
collaborating with and in community with. So I'm very grateful for the recognition. I'm very grateful

50:45.760 --> 50:55.520
for the, the collaboration. Very grateful for both of those. I'm very concerned, very concerned about

50:56.560 --> 51:03.920
undertaking whatever, the exercise of whatever influence I garner to do it with as much

51:03.920 --> 51:09.200
virtue and virtuosity as I can. So that's why I've set up and I've got, there's the, the

51:09.200 --> 51:15.040
Viveki Foundation, which is a not-for-profit and there's Ryan Barton, who's the executive director

51:15.040 --> 51:20.640
and Eric Foster from Upfire, the director of operations and there's people on the board

51:21.200 --> 51:27.840
and so, right? And so there's, I have an arms length relationship. So the money and the recognition

51:27.840 --> 51:35.280
is not right here. It's over there and it's, there's a lot of people who I selected very carefully,

51:36.240 --> 51:44.000
who are very committed to a virtuous vision. And so, and I'm constantly looking for

51:45.680 --> 51:49.920
feedback on how not to become a guru in the pejorative sense of the word.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.480
Yeah. So that, that's hitting me.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.240
Because unfortunately people will do that.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.560
Oh, they will and I don't want to.

51:59.280 --> 52:05.920
Yeah. And I really, really, really, really don't want to. I really don't want, I want,

52:05.920 --> 52:13.600
I really am, I deeply aspire to being Socrates and I really, that is the most profound thing I want.

52:14.160 --> 52:22.960
And I don't want anything to come at the expense of my aspiration to being as authentically

52:22.960 --> 52:28.400
Socratic as I can. And, and in connection with that, although it doesn't sound like they're the

52:28.400 --> 52:33.360
same thing, but they're connected, you know, all the, all the fundamental relationships that,

52:34.560 --> 52:45.760
that I value for their own sake. So I don't want that. There's, I'm not, I'm socially phobic

52:45.760 --> 52:51.760
by nature. This is a, this is a decade long persona that I have crafted that you're interacting

52:51.760 --> 52:58.880
with, not inauthentically, by the way. I'm sure it aspirationally. But so I was talking to Ryan

52:58.880 --> 53:07.840
last night about, I recently released a video on AI and the scientific and philosophical and

53:07.840 --> 53:13.200
spiritual import of what's happening in AI right now. And it's, it's doing very well.

53:13.920 --> 53:23.920
And, and so I get a sense of exposure that is quite unpleasant for me around that.

53:27.840 --> 53:34.000
But, but if I hadn't done it, like I did that, I worked really, really hard,

53:34.800 --> 53:39.360
like almost obsessively so for about three or three or four weeks before I released the video,

53:39.360 --> 53:44.320
I say, because I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility. So it's not like I can't do

53:44.320 --> 53:50.560
these things because of the exposure, because then I'm beset by a tremendous sense of responsibility

53:50.560 --> 53:55.760
to the level of obligation, you know, about trying to do something, try to do whatever I can to steer

53:55.760 --> 54:01.120
this towards the good for the sake of my family and my kids, my friends and for the world.

54:01.760 --> 54:08.480
Yeah, right. But, but on the other hand, yeah, like, it's like, it's like, it's, it's like,

54:10.240 --> 54:15.920
it's, it's, it's a negative affect of exposure that I also confront around it.

54:17.520 --> 54:24.720
So techniques that you do to control your id from seeping into all of this. What do you, what do

54:24.720 --> 54:34.240
you do to? Well, I have my, I mean, I do my daily ecology of practices, and which are do a lot about,

54:34.240 --> 54:39.920
you know, that there's dialogical practices, imaginable mindfulness practices, you know,

54:39.920 --> 54:44.800
body movement movement, the whole ecology, trying to design it, all the stuff I'm talking about,

54:44.800 --> 54:50.720
designing a proper well, I enter into, you know, a dialectic into the logos, philosophical fellowship,

54:50.720 --> 54:55.600
I do practices, I like my patrons are becoming like, we do, we do practices together, which is,

54:56.160 --> 55:00.240
and I mean this, I mean this with respect, it's kind of like going to church together.

55:01.840 --> 55:08.880
Yeah. And then, like I said, I know that we, we can't rely on self interpretation and self

55:08.880 --> 55:14.160
direction, we have to engage it, but we can't rely on that for getting us to the good, we have to

55:14.160 --> 55:19.520
make sure that there are people other than us, we nevertheless have our best interest at park,

55:19.520 --> 55:26.560
who we have empowered, or also make it personal, who I've empowered to challenge me, to speak on me,

55:26.560 --> 55:32.240
to keep me away from, so I don't, like for example, all the money doesn't come to me,

55:32.240 --> 55:37.520
it goes to the Raveki Foundation, and then I will take out expenses for projects, and I also take out,

55:37.520 --> 55:43.840
you know, a relatively small honorarium, because, you know, I should, this is a lot of my time,

55:43.840 --> 55:50.000
and I like, I'm not generating income elsewhere that I could be doing, so it compensates for that,

55:50.000 --> 56:00.960
but it's very much about putting in place also the external safeguards where there is specific

56:00.960 --> 56:06.000
people who have been specifically empowered with specific duties to help keep me on track.

56:06.880 --> 56:12.080
All of that can still screw up, but the more and more of this, I can make self organizing and

56:12.080 --> 56:19.360
independent from my, you know, personal, my personal cognitive and emotional biases,

56:20.320 --> 56:26.720
the better I think I can meet the demands which, and meeting the demands I do find very meaningful,

56:26.720 --> 56:32.560
meeting the demands of doing this virtually, and with doing it virtuously and with virtuosity,

56:32.560 --> 56:38.240
yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. That's beautiful, it's hard sometimes, you know, and

56:39.200 --> 56:47.600
I am obviously nowhere near you, but as I, you know, I, this little podcast has allowed me to,

56:47.600 --> 56:55.200
it's opened up doors, of course, it's allowed me to write for, you know, a publication,

56:55.200 --> 57:04.480
it's allowed for me to have great conversations with you and other people, it's, I have, I mean,

57:04.480 --> 57:10.320
I have my one, only one video and I don't ever want it to, because that was, I was very anxious

57:10.320 --> 57:15.200
when I saw how many people were watching it, but one video was 40,000 views and I remember,

57:16.720 --> 57:20.800
I was like, I remember like working out and I was at the gym and I was just clicking to see

57:20.800 --> 57:28.720
how many people were watching it, and I was both flattered and both, I was getting egotistical

57:28.720 --> 57:33.600
about it, but I was also extremely, I was growing extremely, you know, anxious over it,

57:33.680 --> 57:38.640
and so it's like, in all this, you kind of, you get this false sense of gravitas, and so sometimes,

57:38.640 --> 57:43.360
I know in my life, the people, you made that very clear and you made that beautiful point, it's like,

57:43.360 --> 57:49.360
you know, you have the individuals, the friends, or the loved ones, the lovers, right, that, that

57:49.360 --> 57:56.800
ground you, and it's like, well, oftentimes, now that I've been doing more, you know, sometimes that

57:56.800 --> 58:00.960
gets, that gets into the way, that gets into the way, you know, sometimes with my relationship,

58:01.040 --> 58:05.520
with my wife, maybe I'm working on something and, you know, my wife says, oh, look at the baby,

58:07.040 --> 58:12.800
or, hey, you want to hang out, and it's like, well, I'm writing, or I'm collaborating, and so

58:12.800 --> 58:18.560
that's on a teeny tiny scale, so I, you know, I can't imagine, you know, the,

58:20.480 --> 58:26.160
how conscious you have to be, basically, on a moment-to-moment basis, which is good,

58:26.160 --> 58:31.040
but it's also very hard in order to not deteriorate these relationships, and we don't have to get

58:31.040 --> 58:36.000
into it by any means, I don't, I'm not asking you to- Well, I do want to say something about it,

58:36.000 --> 58:41.040
I mean, I was, because I was talking to, I was talking to my life partner, I was talking to her

58:41.040 --> 58:51.280
last night, and it's really interesting, I was saying how she actually becomes more and more real.

58:51.760 --> 58:58.080
I said something to the effectist, as some of my, you know, dreams come true, I more and more find

58:58.080 --> 59:03.200
the woman of my dreams to be more real, that's what's actually happening for me,

59:05.520 --> 59:12.240
because the ephemerality of this, and again, please, I want to, I'm very grateful for the

59:12.240 --> 59:17.200
recognition, I really am, and I'm not, I'm not being dismissive or insulting of it, but

59:17.680 --> 59:24.720
sometimes, there's an old Greek proverb, that God sometimes punish us by giving us what we want,

59:24.720 --> 59:31.920
right, and so a lot of these things that I, you know, I wanted more recognition,

59:31.920 --> 59:36.640
I wanted my work to get out there, I wanted to make a difference, and you know, and to be really

59:36.640 --> 59:44.080
honest, there's an egocentric, egotistical aspect to that, which- Always does. Yeah, well, I mean,

59:44.160 --> 59:50.960
because, you know, if you totally get rid of the self-preservation strategy, you'll, you'll die,

59:52.400 --> 01:00:01.200
and so, but, you know, getting a lot of the success, as you said, I didn't really expect

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.880
the gas, although I'd always wanted it, you know, that weird sort of semi-fantasy thing that we all

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:16.240
were, getting that fulfilled has, and I don't want to come off as being saintly, because that is not

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:25.760
what I am or claim it to be, but it's, it's kind of, it's, it's salience diminishes in some important

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.120
way with respect to the things that are really mattering in your life, that's what I found,

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:37.440
I mean, I'm not saying this is universal, but, but for me, that's been helpful, it's like, wait,

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.760
you know, all of this is really cool and everything, but what's really happening phenomenologically is

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:49.440
that's sort of now more background for me, and my relationship with Sara, and like, and my kids,

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:57.680
and like, my friends, that's not really- I really do, I mean, I've only been a dad now for

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:06.800
a year and a half, but this, his birth and his life has coincided with this project of mine,

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.440
and kind of my, you know, this is my second career, I was a high school teacher, and then I had my own

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:18.960
meeting process for a while, and I kind of, this allowed me to, it jolted me back on this path,

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.320
and part of that jolt was my son being born, and the encouragement of my wife, and, but getting into,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.960
and connecting what you were saying, yeah, I understand that he's actually more real now

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:40.240
than I ever have before, and I hope that as I grow and I develop in my pursuits, that actually allows

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:48.640
my boy to be more vivid to me, and my wife to be more vivid to me day by day, and it's beautiful

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:55.600
when these things mesh, and when our, you know, intellectual pursuit allows for our personal

01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:02.400
pursuit to become more vivid. I hope so, I mean, I, at the end of my practices, I frequently pray

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:08.960
a prayer that Socrates pray, he prays it initially to, it goes something along the lines, a beloved

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:18.640
pan and all God to dwell in this place, give me the inward beauty, inward beauty, and let the

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.160
outward man and the inward man be as one, and I probably messed that up a bit.

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:36.720
Right, and, and, and, like, if, like, I hope, and I try, I put effort into cultivating the discernment,

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.720
I could see how people could be tempted for the reverse, the salience of the fame and other

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.520
things could actually cause that to be foregrounded, and the real things to be backgrounded, that's

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:55.120
obviously happened to be, yeah, tons of rock stars, and, right, no, exactly, right, the rock star

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:02.880
phenomenon, there's that. And I've also, I've also seen, I've also seen

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.160
that there's a temptation, right, right, I don't want to totally use that in religious sense,

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:15.280
but I don't want to ignore the religious sense either, so that's why I'm hesitating, but there's

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:22.080
a temptation, I can feel it, wait, this fame and this, you know, this fame and this wealth,

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.280
it's not as satisfying as I thought it would be, so the answer is I should get more,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:32.400
I've felt that impulse come up to me, and it comes up from this Darwinian depth, right, wait,

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.480
the answer is go higher on the hierarchy, that's surely the answer, right, and it's like, whoa,

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:49.680
and I've noticed that too. So I'm trying to keep, right, I'm trying to, you know, be properly,

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.680
like mindful of them, not suppress it, but also not, not obsess about it, like get that golden

01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:04.880
mean about it, so that I can hopefully not fall prey to that temptation. I would like to be,

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:13.520
if I could get what I wanted, I would like to be, you know, have a large enough audience

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.480
where people have to take me seriously, but not so large that people would start to idolize me,

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.640
that's where I would like to sit. That's the sweet spot. Yeah, that's the sweet spot for me.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.120
I really do hope you get there, I think you are going to get there, because again, you

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:37.600
walk through this so precisely, and you can see it, like, you, I mean, in my opinion,

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.320
you don't, you never come off as disingenuous, you know, and even like with your conversations,

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.320
I mean, how, I mean, how I and how I'm sure many people approached you at first was through your

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:54.960
conversations with Jordan Peterson, and you never came off as disingenuine, you came off as real,

01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:00.080
you came off as authentic, and I think that's why people ended up, you know, following you, and I

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:07.760
think there's, I don't know, I've never really, I mean, this is not a developed thought whatsoever,

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:14.000
and I think Jordan Peterson is on the same path, but there's obviously a difference between you

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.360
and Jordan Peterson, and I'm not just talking about philosophically, you know, I think Jordan

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:27.120
probably has a little more proclivity towards the pomp and pageantry of it all, and I don't think

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.040
that's not a shot, and I think that's actually, that's sometimes a very good thing, and you need

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:36.160
people like that, right, because you need people who also are going to talk to the, I mean, you said

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.160
you want to find that sweet spot, and people have different sweet spots, and there are some

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:46.400
individuals who just need to talk to the culture at large, right, and you need that, and sometimes

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:53.200
that actually makes you, or that is, it's then taken on the pomp and pageantry of that is actually

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.880
a necessity, though, because it's part of the game, so, but anyway, I mean, I think that's why,

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:03.600
I think that's why a lot of individuals have really linked up with your work, though, is because

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:10.080
it's, and I don't know the word to describe it, I'll be honest, I'll just say authentic again,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.880
but, and so I think that's really telling that you admitted yourself that you want to find that

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:19.680
sweet spot, where you want to get big, but you don't want to get big, right, and I just think

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.160
that's really cool, to put it really cool, I know that's like, that's not the most profound, I just

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.520
think it's really cool, though. No, but thank you, thank you. Yeah, Jordan and I are different,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:36.400
yeah, I mean, we have an interesting relationship, and of course it predates him becoming like a

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:47.440
superstar that he is, right, we aspire differently, I think Jordan aspires to being,

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.560
this is half the joke, and I think I've said this to his face and he laughed, so I don't think it's,

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.200
I don't think it's an appropriate, but he aspires to being Moses, I aspire to being Socrates,

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.880
and those are very different aspirations, because they're very different aspirations.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:08.000
Right, and, and I agree with you, there are times when we need a Moses figure of a prophet

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.840
that will lead people to the prophet land, lead them out of bondage to the prophet land,

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:18.960
out of promised land, I think Jordan is, you know, I think both his virtues and his vices,

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:23.120
and I will admit that I have virtues and vices, so I'm not trying to, but I think both his virtues

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:31.360
and his vices orbit around that vision, right, whereas mine are around Socrates, and that's a

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:37.280
different vision. Oh, everyone has a mediator, right, I mean, everyone has a mediator, everyone has

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:43.440
that object of desire, and the sweet spot in life, right, just really quite, you know,

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.520
what Gerard would say is that everyone is going to have mediator, it's picking the right mediators,

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:51.520
that's what that's, that's exactly it, that's about, and that's the, that's the Socratic

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:57.680
prayer, I want that outward and inward to be resonant, and resonant, such that I, I, my life

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:09.120
is as virtuous as possible. I mean, try to manage these three things, virtue, virtuosity, and the

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:15.600
virtual is sort of what I'm wrestling with a lot, because they intersect and really interesting,

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.360
and on, and ways that haven't been very well articulated by previous people, because they

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:26.320
didn't have the virtual as the third in those three, which in it alters things, like you and I

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.720
would not be speaking like this without the virtual, what, how does virtuosity and virtue

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:36.320
show up here, and how does the, how does the, and the reverse, how does what we do in virtual space

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.880
translate back into the real space of virtue and virtuosity, these are important questions we

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:47.360
were wrestling with, right. No, I meant, and sometimes you got to, they're hard questions,

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.840
and I think precisely, and so they're so difficult that we're trying to actually

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:59.760
have these conversations function in the, in brick and mortar spaces, and so it's like,

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.840
I know that you are doing, you've been doing conferences, and that there's another conference

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:09.920
coming up, and me and my, me and my good friend, Marcus, who runs the channel more Christ, we have

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:18.080
an event coming up in DC with Michael Martin, and Paul Vander Clay, and, and, you know, we hope

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.840
our, our goal actually, one of our goals is that we plan our vision, Marcus don't get mad at me that

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:31.760
I'm talking about our vision, but our vision is, you know, we plan on having conferences, hopefully

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.800
multiple times a year, now Marcus is in Ireland, I mean, I'm in Cleveland, so it's obviously far away,

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.720
but if we could do like a European thing, and maybe an American conference, another thing that

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:49.840
we're thinking of is, you know, doing conferences, it's a conference camp, where a group of 15,

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:58.960
16, 20 people is actually a camping trip, right, and that, that, that projects you into a different

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:06.320
headspace, and conversation is, oh yeah, living with people is, is just important,

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:12.560
we, yeah, Ryan and Eric and I need to talk more about this, we're first doing lots of events,

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.360
and trying to get regular events going, and regular communities of practice, but we, yeah,

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.640
we need, we also need, we, we need to have retreats where people live together for a bit,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:29.040
when I went on, we turned to the source last July, with Ray Kelly, living with these people,

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.760
and pushing yourself to the horizon of horror every day, for spiritual transformation,

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.920
as an impact on you. Joe, I've got a ghost on it, we've sort of shifted to you being

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:44.400
the host, is there any final thing you'd like to ask me before I leave?

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.480
There is, but I don't know how far we would get into it, but I'll pop it in there, maybe this

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.360
will leave us for a conversation in the future, really quick, why aren't you putting on this?

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.160
Physical beauty, is it beauty, are people's physical selves beautiful, or just not ugly?

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.560
That's to ask the question, if I were to answer it from like a platonic framework is,

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.880
yeah, came physical bodies, them and shine with beauty, yes. Beautiful, that was a question that

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.960
was on my mind, and I thought that was going to get me a one sentence answer, so you gave it to me,

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:29.200
I appreciate that. One of the most sensitive things in my relationship with my current partner is,

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:40.000
by objective measures, she's a physically attractive woman, but so I want that understood,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.840
but I was really attracted first, and this had not happened to me before,

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.240
I was really attracted first, and I'll speak a little bit poetically, because it's appropriate,

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:57.520
I was first really first attracted to the beauty of her soul, and then I noticed in conjunction,

01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:05.760
and as a function of that, I noticed how physically beautiful she is, and that has been really important

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:19.360
for me. That was like a, that was a wake up moment for me, and I think we have to be open to very

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:24.160
often, and you know, many people argue this played out famously, that we start with physical beauty,

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:32.000
and then we move to other, but it's happened that the reverse has been the case for me,

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:38.800
really importantly, and I just wanted to note that, I just wanted to note that, I think the

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:45.680
question of beauty is very much, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not unidirectional, is what

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.840
I'm saying, you can both be drawn through the physical to what is beyond, and what is beyond

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.440
the physical can reach to you first, and then draw you in attraction to the physical.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.360
Yeah, all right, that's so true, it's, that like gave me goosebumps when you said that,

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:09.200
my wife is absolutely gorgeous, I would say she's absolutely gorgeous, and I would say by

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.680
side of me, she's absolutely gorgeous, but you know, there's always those times where every woman

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:18.560
and every man will get insecure, and you know, my wife sometimes asks me, you know, why, why me,

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.040
I tell her, because you really have the most beautiful soul that I've ever encountered in

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.080
my whole life, and you admitted the same thing, so I just think that's really, it's wonderful,

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.800
it's absolutely wonderful. Yeah, it is, it is, and yeah, I think that's a great, and I think that's

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.400
a beautiful place to end. Yeah, it is a good place to end, it is a good place to end, thank you,

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.520
Joe, this has been really wonderful. Yeah, thank you for having me. Oh, thank you for having me,

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:50.720
and I will send you a copy of this for your channel, and we'll talk again soon. Thank you so much, Jen.
