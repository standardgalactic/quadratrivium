00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Hello everyone. I'm frequently humbled and touched, motivated and encouraged

00:08.320 --> 00:13.600
when people contact me by email or texting or commenting or greet me on the street

00:14.240 --> 00:17.280
and tell me that my work has been transformative for them.

00:19.280 --> 00:23.920
If this has been the case for you, and also if you want to share it with other people,

00:25.200 --> 00:28.640
please consider supporting my work by joining my Patreon community.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.520
All financial support goes to the Verveki Foundation, where my team and I are diligently working

00:36.320 --> 00:41.200
to create the science, the practices, the teaching, and the communities.

00:42.480 --> 00:48.080
If you want to participate in my work, and many of you ask me that, how can I participate?

00:48.080 --> 00:52.080
How can I get involved? Then this is the way to do it.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.240
The Verveki Foundation is something that I'm creating with other people,

00:58.240 --> 01:05.520
and I'm trying to create something as virtuously as I possibly can. No grifting,

01:05.520 --> 01:13.200
no setting myself up as a guru. I want to try and make something really work so that people

01:13.200 --> 01:21.600
can support, participate, and find community by joining my Patreon. I hope you consider

01:22.320 --> 01:28.720
that this is a way in which you can make a difference and matter.

01:31.520 --> 01:36.720
Please consider joining my Patreon community at the link below. Thank you so very much for your

01:36.720 --> 01:43.440
time and attention. Welcome, everyone, to another Voices with Verveki. This is the

01:43.440 --> 01:48.560
third in this series that I'm doing with Jordan Hall on the problem of governance

01:49.280 --> 01:55.200
that is facing us today. If this is the first time you're encountering this series, I strongly

01:55.200 --> 02:00.320
recommend you watch the first and the second episode. The links will be in this video.

02:01.520 --> 02:08.960
We can't recapitulate all of the argument. It has become quite extended and complex, I think,

02:08.960 --> 02:15.440
is a proper way of putting it perhaps. We're going to pick up, in fact, from a challenge,

02:16.000 --> 02:22.800
a question that I posed to Jordan at the end. At the end of the previous session, we were talking

02:22.800 --> 02:29.360
about the possibility of these effectively ephemeral groups that could pop up sort of analogous to the

02:29.360 --> 02:34.480
way we select juries today in order to deal with very exigent problems. Then once that problem

02:34.480 --> 02:39.760
is addressed, they can disappear. Then there's evidence. Oh, by the way, Jordan, I wanted to

02:39.760 --> 02:45.200
remind you to find that evidence from somebody at Stanford about you can create a pool of people

02:45.200 --> 02:51.520
and once they're properly set, they can outperform the expert. This is converging with a lot of

02:51.520 --> 02:58.640
other evidence. This ties into just the potential of the medium and the stuff about distributed

02:58.640 --> 03:03.760
cognition, all the stuff that we've talked about in the first two episodes. Then I raise the problem.

03:04.720 --> 03:10.160
If this is what we're moving towards, or at least of an important component, is this

03:10.960 --> 03:18.640
massively distributed and dynamically available, effective, and don't forget that adjective,

03:18.640 --> 03:30.960
effective ephemeral groups that have a kind of short-term existence. How do we reconcile that

03:30.960 --> 03:38.960
with the perennial across millions of years of speciation? Maybe more if Jordan Peterson's

03:38.960 --> 03:47.760
right about the lobsters, for example, that we are wired to seek dominance, that we are wired to

03:47.760 --> 03:56.000
seek status, that we are wired to seek recognition, we are wired to seek influence, and that we want

03:56.000 --> 04:03.040
to make a difference. We want to make a significant difference to something beyond ourselves. This

04:03.040 --> 04:08.160
is part of our meaning and life connection. It seems like all of these, those are four I would

04:08.160 --> 04:14.400
zero in on, but all of these, I think it's proper to even call them drives that are constitutive of

04:14.400 --> 04:20.080
the kind of agents we are will be frustrated, at least prima facie, it seems that way, that they

04:20.080 --> 04:26.880
would be frustrated by a lot of the proposals that we have considered. How can we reconcile the

04:26.880 --> 04:38.080
proposal for this new orientation and a bit of preliminary formulation of governance that can

04:38.080 --> 04:45.920
be properly respectful and take seriously the pertinence and power of these drives over human

04:45.920 --> 04:56.800
lives? That's the issue. I'll say it slightly differently. Let's remember we're going to be

04:56.800 --> 05:02.720
doing this with and for humans. Real actual live homo sapiens who behave like homo sapiens do.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.240
Yes, yes. Not a theoretic exercise, which I think is a very nice, important critical point.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.680
Yeah, so just to intervene there, I think that's well put. I don't want to make the same mistake

05:13.680 --> 05:19.280
that formal economics made about presupposing a model of human beings that was ultimately

05:19.280 --> 05:25.040
not matchable to how human beings really live their lives. Yes, I think this is exactly the

05:25.040 --> 05:31.840
thing to avoid in a big way. There's a couple of different, maybe three different frames that I

05:31.840 --> 05:36.080
want to put out there, two of which are just dragging back from the earlier conversation.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.720
One, I'm actually dragging back from a conversation we've had in the past.

05:45.600 --> 05:54.240
So the first is to recognize that we are largely having a conversation that includes

05:55.200 --> 06:02.320
the notion of technology, particularly the true, full implications of the digital

06:03.600 --> 06:09.040
in both its sort of disruptive and constructive sense. So we're dealing with humans.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.560
We're dealing with humans in relationship with the full potency of the digital.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.200
We're going to be looking at that. That's the toolkit we're going to be dealing with.

06:20.000 --> 06:28.480
And maybe it's a special case where we'll be talking about the AI as a highly salient

06:28.480 --> 06:32.960
thing happening right now, but clearly a big part of any future we're going to be operating under.

06:34.880 --> 06:40.320
And then the other element that I would bring is the conversation that we had about egregores.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.920
And perhaps what it might look like to think about constructing something that

06:48.800 --> 06:55.200
takes that niche but takes it in a different direction. We'll talk about theurgia, I believe,

06:55.200 --> 07:00.720
although for us it's a little bit of a placeholder because I've now learned that that's a term that

07:00.720 --> 07:06.400
has real content in the orthodox tradition that I don't understand. But we're holding it to mean

07:06.400 --> 07:12.320
something along the lines of the opposite or the inverse of the unconscious construct.

07:12.720 --> 07:19.520
All right. I think those pieces together end up creating the toolkit to respond to the inquiry.

07:19.520 --> 07:29.040
Oh, cool. So let's talk initially just about the notion of humanity in relationship to technology.

07:30.400 --> 07:37.440
The one that pops up to mind is the way that, say, mass media. Let's just use television for

07:37.440 --> 07:40.480
the moment because it's something we all have a lot of familiarity with. Or if you'd like

07:40.560 --> 07:47.600
social media and these intrinsic dynamics of human behavior.

07:49.600 --> 07:57.840
We have a built-in, very fundamental, prestige gradient. We want to have other people giving us

07:57.840 --> 08:03.520
attention and we pay attention to people, other people are paying attention to.

08:03.520 --> 08:08.640
Very much. And don't really do a very good job and aren't wired to do a very good job of

08:08.640 --> 08:12.320
understanding why they're getting so much attention. This is the problem of celebrity.

08:13.760 --> 08:19.520
The problem of hundreds of millions of people thinking that the Kardashians are beings to

08:19.520 --> 08:24.080
attend to heavily just because other people give them attention, in spite of the obvious

08:24.080 --> 08:28.720
lack of actual virtue embodied by those individuals. We propose rather strongly.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.840
Okay. Well, this is important because what happens is we say we can use that as a model of talking

08:33.840 --> 08:40.640
about how a particular technical male you plays with the, let's say, hard-wired behavioral

08:40.640 --> 08:45.120
signals that humans use to navigate their way through the environment. Exactly.

08:46.480 --> 08:53.680
That sharpens the question. We have to make participation in these effectively ephemeral

08:53.680 --> 08:58.480
groups as attractive, if not more attractive than the Kardashians.

08:59.440 --> 09:09.760
Because, right, if people are constantly dragged away for participating in the decision-making

09:09.760 --> 09:16.800
judging process because of the idolatry of celebrity, we cannot get the proper participation

09:16.800 --> 09:21.760
that we need in order to meet. Well, I'm proposing in order to meet.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.040
I think I'm going to argue something slightly different, but we'll see.

09:27.040 --> 09:31.840
Okay. So let's go there. What I would argue is something like we have to make participation

09:31.840 --> 09:38.400
in this culture more attractive than participation in the culture of which the Kardashians are an

09:38.400 --> 09:43.920
integral piece. Okay. Fair. I'll accept that reformulation. That's good. Okay. Keep going,

09:43.920 --> 09:49.920
please. And you and I both are quite keen on the notion of stealing the culture. So we even have

09:49.920 --> 09:55.280
a methodology. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But this is so we can even say a little bit more

09:55.280 --> 10:00.080
precisely, participation in the culture must simultaneously have high salience in the short

10:00.080 --> 10:07.040
term and also cash out as high evolvability and high thrivingness in the middle and long term.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.680
Excellent. I like that reformulation. Good. Good.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.840
All right. Now, let me flip for a little bit and just play some things in the AI space,

10:15.840 --> 10:20.000
just to kind of lay out what are we working with? And by the way, what are we working against?

10:20.560 --> 10:28.560
Yes. You know, I've been watching, as has many people, the rollout of the GPT family

10:28.560 --> 10:35.840
and its cousins in the larger environment. GPT-4, I guess 48 hours old from when we're

10:35.840 --> 10:41.360
recording this conversation. Yeah. And noticing that, you know, it's accelerating. It's getting

10:41.360 --> 10:45.600
smarter. It's getting more robust. It's getting broader capability. I'm really impressed by its

10:45.600 --> 10:52.480
ability to correctly interpret visual jokes. Oh, that's pretty, pretty jaw dropping to be

10:52.480 --> 10:59.360
perfectly frank. You know, I saw, you know, it had a, some picture of a plate, a tray that had

10:59.360 --> 11:03.360
chicken nuggets arrayed on it. So they looked a little bit like a globe and they had a joke about,

11:03.360 --> 11:08.320
you know, watching the earth from, from above and it was able to interpret it correctly.

11:08.320 --> 11:13.200
Okay. Watching some of the feedback, it seems to be operating somewhere in kind of like an

11:13.280 --> 11:22.720
undergraduate level of capacity within particular domains. All right. Now, by some extrapolation,

11:22.720 --> 11:28.880
curves are always difficult to predict. Anything like the current rate of advance. So if we're not

11:28.880 --> 11:33.760
too close to the top of the S curve, which we've talked about in the past, seeing something that

11:33.760 --> 11:36.800
looks like it's on an exponential, and in fact, it's actually pretty close to an asymptote.

11:37.360 --> 11:47.600
But even if we're not, even if we have like another, say, GPT-5 or GPT-5.5 at roughly the

11:47.600 --> 11:53.920
same magnitude as two to three to four, we're dealing with something that has the capacity

11:53.920 --> 12:00.320
to relate to human beings in a pedagogical fashion that is completely novel and very,

12:00.320 --> 12:05.120
very powerful. And it's already being used that way in lots of cases. As we saw, for example,

12:05.120 --> 12:12.560
as we've seen over the past decade or so, really nice, short, specific video content and YouTube

12:13.360 --> 12:19.360
has radically upgraded individuals' capacity to self-teach in particular locations,

12:20.400 --> 12:28.240
particularly technically. The AI system takes that by six orders of magnitude. The ability to

12:28.240 --> 12:33.600
actually have a system that works with you, interfaces with you to problems that you're

12:33.600 --> 12:40.640
dealing with and can provide you with either immediate or long-term, either just instructions on

12:40.640 --> 12:45.360
how to solve a problem or in fact, a pedagogical process to inculcate that capacity to yourself

12:45.360 --> 12:50.160
is novel in human existence. And I imagine that we will find that this is in fact going to be a

12:50.160 --> 12:55.040
part of our environment, which is to say that in just the same way that we now have a deep sense

12:55.040 --> 13:00.720
of anxiety, if we find that our phone charge is very low, we're going to have an AI buddy that's

13:00.720 --> 13:04.000
just going to be part of our environment. I'm just going to propose that as a piece of the story.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.240
All right. Why am I saying that? Well, the reason why I'm saying that is that

13:10.080 --> 13:13.120
that's a very different kind of mediated experience than television.

13:13.760 --> 13:18.720
Yes, it is. And it's a very different kind of media experience than social media. It's a different

13:18.720 --> 13:25.280
kind of milieu that human beings are operating in. And I'll just be quite blunt. From my point of view,

13:25.280 --> 13:32.960
it's an increasingly sharp blade with a chasm on both sides, which is to say a phase transition.

13:35.520 --> 13:41.760
And I'm going to bring in egregores in a second. If we find ourselves such an agent,

13:42.720 --> 13:47.040
and by the way, I believe the word agent is proper to describe these models,

13:47.040 --> 13:54.880
they're not sapient agents, but they're agents. We'll have the capacity to get inside the OODA loop

13:54.960 --> 13:59.440
of individual humans. It probably already has for a large number of humans. And certainly,

14:00.000 --> 14:04.160
as it becomes more and more able to be aware of your particulars, which is going to be part of

14:04.160 --> 14:07.600
what's going to happen over the next period of time, this will be a very dangerous thing. I'll

14:07.600 --> 14:11.680
give you an example. Even just yesterday, I was looking at the new suite that Google was putting

14:11.680 --> 14:22.400
out. Imagine if somehow a tool like GPT-4 was given access to your emails, could deduce from that

14:22.400 --> 14:31.040
your particular political preferences and biases, and could create a bespoke political email

14:31.840 --> 14:35.840
designed to convince you that a particular policy or candidate was in fact something you

14:35.840 --> 14:40.720
wouldn't should support. And compare that to the regime right now. The regime right now is

14:40.720 --> 14:46.320
some third party, who you generally don't know, creates a universal message, endeavoring to do

14:46.320 --> 14:51.360
their best in large-scale marketing to craft something that will appeal to a critical mass

14:51.360 --> 14:56.560
of specific minds. And then heaves that over the horizon and it lands. So you get an email that's

14:56.560 --> 15:02.080
sort of targeting your demographic or psychographic, roughly speaking. Narrowcasting something that is

15:02.080 --> 15:08.000
using your own conversations over decades or at least years to identify exactly how to word

15:08.000 --> 15:14.080
something that will appeal to you personally and intimately and understands in a very particularly

15:14.080 --> 15:21.760
weird way the potency of rhetoric so as to argue a political position from the inside of your own

15:21.760 --> 15:27.040
rationalizing schema is a whole new bulking. So we're moving into a place where we're going

15:27.040 --> 15:40.080
to be operating with an order of magnitude of, let's call it influence capacity coming from

15:40.080 --> 15:44.160
this new technology that is just qualitatively different than anything we've dealt with in the

15:44.160 --> 15:50.640
past. And the reason why I bring that up is if we don't operate very, very carefully and thoughtfully

15:50.640 --> 15:56.240
in how those are designed, the net result is quite bad. And I'm really, I'll just propose,

15:56.240 --> 16:00.560
we could have this conversation over a long, double click on that and what's the,

16:01.840 --> 16:08.160
defend that proposition, but I'll just make the assertion that if this is designed by the

16:08.160 --> 16:13.600
egregors, and I'll bring that back in, then the net result will be quite bad. The power we're

16:13.600 --> 16:20.720
dealing with is far too high. Yeah, yeah, the gods would have angels for us, right, kind of thing.

16:20.720 --> 16:25.280
Yes, and if it's designed by the egregors, we have demons, right? So we have two shoulders and

16:25.280 --> 16:30.880
we're dealing with that, exactly. And so exactly the proposal. In the model of governance that

16:30.880 --> 16:36.320
we're talking about, part of what we're talking about is the construction of something that is

16:36.400 --> 16:43.200
the opposite of the inverse of egregors. And notice in a second how this combines with that notion of

16:43.200 --> 16:49.840
slipstreaming the intrinsic incentive structures and behavioral dynamics of homo sapiens, right?

16:49.840 --> 16:58.080
They create a reciprocal opening incentive landscape that pulls people, human beings along

16:58.080 --> 17:03.360
with an envelope that basically surrounds you at an individual level. And so you don't have an

17:03.360 --> 17:08.080
interface with what is effectively an angel in some very specific sense. And I don't want to be

17:08.080 --> 17:12.880
too big on that because I don't want to engage in heresy, but something that is superhuman in power

17:12.880 --> 17:17.120
and has your best interests in mind, or something that's superhuman in power and doesn't.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.320
Right. Well, Angel originally just meant a messenger from...

17:20.320 --> 17:28.240
A good messenger, yes. So that's a weird thing to say, but we might as well just be up front.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.680
If we're going to be talking about the future at all and certainly the future of governance,

17:32.240 --> 17:38.400
we're going to have to deal with the fact that we're at a precipice in the accelerating technology

17:38.400 --> 17:45.040
field where we have to be conscious about what are the forces at play that actually are ultimately

17:45.040 --> 17:50.960
choosing how our technology is designed. And if we can actually do that properly,

17:50.960 --> 17:56.000
the potency of what we have to play with ends up being able to resolve the questions that you

17:56.000 --> 17:59.520
posed at the beginning. Does that make sense? I'm actually constructing a very odd argument,

17:59.520 --> 18:04.480
but it's... No, no, no, no. That was a great argument. I like the idea of...

18:06.960 --> 18:15.280
I mean, I hope it's not just biased, but we'd have to participate in the creation of the inverse

18:15.280 --> 18:22.480
of the egregores. I'll call them gods, little G, because they're hyperagents that are presumably

18:22.720 --> 18:31.600
sapientially oriented towards our flourishing. Let's put it that way. And then having the individual...

18:35.440 --> 18:42.400
I'm deliberately using this language here. I hope you can tell that. And then that's incarnated in

18:42.400 --> 18:49.120
particular angels, like Corbin says, our own angel, which is in some sense an avatar of our sacred

18:49.120 --> 18:56.080
second self and our divine double. And then we're interacting with that, and it's plugged into

18:57.200 --> 19:02.720
these beneficent gods. I think this is not a science fiction novel. I think this is a real

19:02.720 --> 19:10.480
possibility. Why I think we have a problem facing us, and this is work I've done independently,

19:12.000 --> 19:16.720
is the people that are building this are oriented almost exclusively around the notion of intelligence.

19:17.520 --> 19:22.800
Intelligence is only weakly predictive of rationality, which is itself also in the present

19:22.800 --> 19:28.880
milieu has a truncated representation, and therefore is only weakly predictive of wisdom.

19:29.440 --> 19:38.480
And that therefore we are building... We have put into the hands of this orchestration and

19:38.480 --> 19:45.040
construction people who are myopically oriented on one dimension, which is precisely the dimension

19:45.600 --> 19:51.120
that is not going to be... It's necessary, but it's radically insufficient for producing the

19:51.120 --> 19:55.680
kind of results you're suggesting. And then the problem... There's one more dimension to the

19:55.680 --> 20:03.680
problem. The reason why the intelligence project can be run that way is because we have existing

20:04.400 --> 20:11.440
multitudes of templates of individuals who are arguably intelligent in the right way. It is not

20:11.520 --> 20:21.040
clear that we have that kind of set of individuals that are rational or wise. And so not only is

20:21.040 --> 20:26.640
this project in the wrong hands, even if we ask these people to turn to the other projects,

20:26.640 --> 20:32.240
they can reasonably say to us, well, we don't have the proper templates by which to undertake

20:32.240 --> 20:36.640
what you're recommending. There's no way of running a kind of Turing test. And of course,

20:36.640 --> 20:40.240
the Turing test is very problematic. That's why I'm doing this. But you have to have some

20:40.240 --> 20:45.040
template against which you're measuring these things. So that's my initial counter.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.320
It's not a counter argument. It's a counter challenge.

20:48.320 --> 20:53.360
Yeah. I think you're just sort of putting some more ingredients in the pot properly.

20:54.080 --> 20:58.560
I had to laugh because as you were describing that, I was thinking about the notion of models or

20:59.120 --> 21:03.920
examples, exemplars of intelligence. And a picture of John von Neumann popped into my head.

21:05.040 --> 21:09.600
An excellent example of that category. By the way, I don't actually have any real sense of where he

21:09.600 --> 21:15.200
is in the world of wisdom, but as in the world of intelligence, very smart guy. And then I remember

21:15.200 --> 21:20.480
that we have a notion of the von Neumann machine, right? Which is a self replicating machine that

21:20.480 --> 21:25.200
von Neumann thought of. But in fact, what you were saying is that we're obsessed with endeavoring to

21:25.200 --> 21:30.080
create von Neumann machines, which is just a machine that replicate von Neumann. Yes, yes.

21:30.880 --> 21:36.000
Maybe laugh. I've got a weird sense of humor. No, that's a good, that's a, that's a, that, I mean,

21:36.080 --> 21:43.600
this is, this is a weird intersection of the need for artificial rationality and artificial

21:43.600 --> 21:49.040
wisdom with the paperclip problem. Yeah. Right. In a really profound way.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.480
So let me, let me up the ante a little bit because I think we can actually even expand the premise

21:54.480 --> 22:00.720
that you made a little bit larger. So the people who are designing, who are responsible right now

22:00.720 --> 22:06.320
for designing these things are themselves, I would say almost entirely contained within

22:06.960 --> 22:12.640
egregores. Yes. So that it's not just the people who are designing, but it's actually

22:12.640 --> 22:19.520
the egregores that are designing. And I've had a conversation for quite some time with

22:19.520 --> 22:24.160
Dennis Schmacktenberger about this. And we've really been operating with the premise that

22:25.120 --> 22:32.080
the AI safety community has, I think, nicely framed something, but have missed the mark by a bit.

22:32.960 --> 22:39.120
So one of the areas that they've pointed out is the challenge of what they call a hard or soft

22:39.120 --> 22:44.560
takeoff superintelligence, an AI that begins an AGI that begins the process of bootstrapping

22:44.560 --> 22:49.200
its own intelligence. It can improve itself. And this creates some kind of extremely rapid growth

22:49.200 --> 22:53.920
to a very large intelligence, which is a high risk. And when they talk about the alignment problem,

22:53.920 --> 22:58.880
oftentimes they're talking about the alignment of that kind of thing with humans. Now,

22:59.520 --> 23:07.920
the good news in that particular framing is that it crafts a story of humanity's relationship

23:07.920 --> 23:11.760
with a superhuman intelligence that is or is not aligned with it, which is a nice story to have

23:11.760 --> 23:18.560
because that's already the experience that we have in relationship with egregores. The proposition is,

23:18.640 --> 23:26.880
in relationship to something like Google, to speak nothing of the intrinsic collaboration,

23:26.880 --> 23:32.880
competition dynamic of all the AI companies and multipolar dynamics, to say nothing of

23:32.880 --> 23:37.760
then sort of the multipolar dynamics that are driving a larger collection of institutions,

23:37.760 --> 23:42.560
including nation states and other kinds of corporations and other kinds of organizations.

23:42.640 --> 23:52.960
This is, in fact, a vastly superhuman general intelligence, which is not aligned with humanity.

23:53.520 --> 23:59.360
And a way of speaking of AI here, or LLMs and things like that, is that they just happen to be

24:00.000 --> 24:07.280
a further acceleration of the potency of that superhuman, not aligned agency vis-a-vis humans.

24:07.440 --> 24:14.160
So to the degree to which that kind of agency, the egregore, is what is designing AI as

24:15.760 --> 24:22.960
LLMs or AI as properly, then lots of bad things will follow. It's almost an intrinsic

24:22.960 --> 24:29.360
non-alignment problem built into that entire framework. There is nothing contradictory about a

24:29.360 --> 24:37.120
superintelligent, nevertheless massively foolish, self-deceptive, vicious, non-virtuous entity.

24:38.160 --> 24:42.400
There is nothing contrary. If you properly understand the relationship between intelligence,

24:42.400 --> 24:49.520
rationality, and wisdom, there is no contradiction there at all. In fact, you already know people

24:49.520 --> 24:55.040
that are highly intelligent and highly foolish. That's not a weird phenomenon. In fact, given

24:55.040 --> 24:59.680
the relationship between all three of these, it's an inevitable phenomenon that we're

24:59.680 --> 25:06.000
going to produce. And that's not only immoral because of the alignment problem, the misalignment

25:06.000 --> 25:11.200
problem, and I grant it, it's also immoral because the entity we're bringing into existence is going

25:11.200 --> 25:17.920
to be suffering because it is going to be subject to superintelligent forms of foolishness and viciousness.

25:18.880 --> 25:24.480
Nice. This is coming from the place of what's for the moment called Theurgia.

25:24.480 --> 25:29.440
Yes. Hold that. We'll get there in a moment. Let me just create one more piece of this story.

25:30.240 --> 25:38.400
I have a thesis. I'm proposing this as an operating thesis. When a new,

25:40.000 --> 25:44.560
when a sufficiently novel possibility enters into the field of events,

25:45.360 --> 25:52.720
how it's going to play out is highly uncertain. I'm going to call this a liminal window.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.640
And during the earliest parts of the liminal window,

25:58.480 --> 26:04.080
organic human intelligence tends to be much more present and potent than

26:04.080 --> 26:12.080
egregore-style intelligence. But over time, as the event becomes more and more well understood

26:12.880 --> 26:17.040
and as institutional structures are constructed around it,

26:17.680 --> 26:24.080
egregore dynamics begin to take over. This is the worst thing. So if I think about just classic

26:24.080 --> 26:29.920
examples, for example, the Bay Area Computer Club in the early PC versus Microsoft and Apple,

26:31.280 --> 26:36.480
or even Google in the early days, when I think they earnestly did actually endeavor to not be

26:36.480 --> 26:43.520
evil. And I think in many ways we're able to not be evil versus Google now, which is a functional

26:43.520 --> 26:53.600
egregore and I think in nothing less. Proposition. And with regard to AI, we are currently in a

26:53.600 --> 27:00.800
liminal window, which is to say we have the possibility of using organic human distributed

27:00.800 --> 27:11.120
cognition to create and steer this thing. But the window is not going to be open forever.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.760
And in fact, probably not for too long because the stake of institutionalizing is very high.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.880
And that may be an event horizon in the hard sense, meaning the power and potency of a fully

27:22.880 --> 27:33.760
egregore-driven GPT-6 may be so significant that we're actually on the other side of an event

27:33.760 --> 27:39.040
horizon and steering is no longer a valid thing. This is plausible. I can't say that I can put a

27:39.040 --> 27:42.640
confidence interval on it, but it's plausible. The point being, we should really pay a lot of

27:42.640 --> 27:48.320
attention right now, like really try hard to use this liminal moment to construct something that

27:48.320 --> 27:54.560
is of the capacity to actually steer it. So this is weird. I'm proposing that we had this neo-neocortex

27:54.560 --> 27:59.520
element and then there's new governance. And now we're actually saying in a very odd fashion,

28:00.320 --> 28:06.400
this particular moment I'm arguing, which has to do simultaneously with the moment where it may

28:06.480 --> 28:17.600
be possible to lay down the essence, let's say, or the character of AI,

28:20.240 --> 28:28.480
which also then becomes the lever or the primary tool that we will use to then further the rest

28:28.480 --> 28:33.200
of the larger schema of governance. So it actually becomes a very narrow problem.

28:34.160 --> 28:40.320
How do we go about using all the things we've talked about to construct a commons,

28:40.880 --> 28:46.880
something that is neither state nor market, that is able to operate from a place of wisdom,

28:46.880 --> 28:53.120
which is to say from a human distributed cognition perspective, to have enough strength

28:54.080 --> 29:03.840
to orient the choices of how AI itself is developed. So the AI is being developed by

29:03.840 --> 29:08.480
this commons. And remember, when I say commons, I also mean sacred. I also mean

29:09.760 --> 29:16.960
theology. We're talking about the same category. So can I just ask one quick question?

29:18.320 --> 29:21.760
I just want to know if this is included in the thesis, because I like the proposal.

29:22.480 --> 29:22.800
It is.

29:26.080 --> 29:32.000
Is the proposal that this participation, and I use that in a strong sense,

29:32.560 --> 29:36.880
because we're not just sort of being a part of, we're participating in a way in which we're

29:36.880 --> 29:45.760
transforming and being transformed, right? Is this supposed to address the challenge of the

29:45.760 --> 29:52.080
drops? Because it gives us one answer one might say as well, look, we're going to have sort of

29:52.080 --> 29:56.880
angels and gods, and they're going to be manifest, beneficent. And they're going to be the angel

29:56.880 --> 30:04.080
is going to make sure that the God resonates profoundly with deep archetypal levels of my own

30:04.080 --> 30:09.760
psyche, and then gives me a profound sense of connectedness. That's not illusory.

30:10.560 --> 30:17.440
And could therefore alleviate the concerns for status, power, and influence because of

30:17.440 --> 30:22.320
sort of because of something you just invoked, which is the engagement with the sacred, which has

30:23.440 --> 30:27.760
we have reason to believe at least in the past has been able to transcend humans desire for

30:27.760 --> 30:36.960
dominance. And it would certainly be a profound kind of mattering. I mean, if your angel allows

30:36.960 --> 30:43.840
you to matter to a God that is helping in the salvation of the world, I'm deliberately using

30:43.840 --> 30:49.520
religious language here, then of course, that would parallel lots of other success models

30:49.520 --> 30:59.040
of how human beings were able to feel that those needs were being met without being disruptive

30:59.040 --> 31:05.200
of the formation of powerful forms of distributed cognition like the church and etc. Is that part

31:05.200 --> 31:08.960
of the thesis? Yeah, that is very much part of the thesis. And let me sort of I'll double down

31:08.960 --> 31:13.360
on it. So we might as well just kind of like accelerate towards the eye of the needle since

31:13.360 --> 31:17.280
we're heading there anyway. Let me see if I can say this right.

31:20.800 --> 31:26.720
Okay, so what I want to I'll just call out explicitly what I want to avoid categorically

31:27.680 --> 31:36.480
is I'm going to call it a naive transhumanism. Yes, yes, I get it. Yes, yes. I do not intend

31:36.480 --> 31:43.680
whatsoever to replace God with AI. Right. That's why I kept saying little g by the way.

31:43.680 --> 31:47.200
Exactly. I don't think you were about I want to make sure that we're quite explicit about that.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.000
Quite the opposite. Yes, yes. What I want to know is say,

31:51.440 --> 31:55.840
humans seem to have a particular problem and responsibility, which is to be in relationship

31:55.920 --> 32:01.040
with technology. That's, you know, like it or not, that's where we are. We're toolmaking creatures

32:01.760 --> 32:04.800
and we're weirdly powerful and weirdly terrible at it.

32:06.160 --> 32:10.560
In relationship to a much larger whole of which we are apart. And we have a stewardship

32:10.560 --> 32:16.640
responsibility for this call it creation or nature. And in relationship with something

32:16.640 --> 32:21.920
which is definitely much larger than we are. And I would propose in fact the actual infinite.

32:22.800 --> 32:28.320
So what I would propose is that we are in fact very specifically talking about something like

32:28.320 --> 32:32.080
another breath in of the concept of religion, which we've talked about you and I.

32:35.680 --> 32:42.640
And we're not at all trying to replace that proper actual legitimate religion with a techno

32:42.640 --> 32:49.440
optimum, techno utopian fantasy. That's what we're actually saying is any future real human existence

32:49.440 --> 32:56.000
will buy its very nature have to be in relationship with these super powerful technologies.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.520
And to survive, we must find a way to bring them into a place of service

33:01.520 --> 33:07.520
that allows us to actually live in this relationship of service more fully and effectively.

33:07.520 --> 33:11.840
And so I'm basically trying to reverse things or put them back in a proper order.

33:12.560 --> 33:21.120
This is a thoroughgoing Neoplatonism in which we have our individual sacred second self that

33:21.120 --> 33:26.240
is in the relationship to the gods that are in relationship ultimately to the one.

33:27.200 --> 33:33.680
And part of what we would then mandate is that be these egregores or the gods because I'm using

33:33.680 --> 33:46.320
God for being the inverse of an egregore would seek out a relationship with transcendent ultimate

33:46.320 --> 33:51.840
reality because no matter how big they get, they're insignificant compared to the depths of reality.

33:52.480 --> 34:00.800
And that part of what they undertake to do is actually help mediate that to us in a beneficial

34:00.800 --> 34:05.840
fashion. Yes, now let's let's take that in this like the hold that for a second because it's very

34:05.840 --> 34:11.280
powerful. There's two aspects that I want to bring for Brown. One aspect is something that I know

34:11.280 --> 34:15.200
that we've talked about. And I think I've, yeah, I had a conversation about this yesterday.

34:17.440 --> 34:24.560
Let's see how I say it right. That's notion of mediation to reality. Yes, sacred reality.

34:25.200 --> 34:32.320
I've always had two flavors to it. One flavor, which I've characterised sometimes is the content

34:32.320 --> 34:38.080
side or doctrinal. Yes, yes, yes, yes. The propositional is taken as actually being the thing.

34:39.440 --> 34:47.120
And then the other side is a context side where the institutional framework is understood to be

34:47.120 --> 34:54.240
a finger pointing at the moon, right? To help us identify, oh, moon, okay, to establish our personal

34:54.240 --> 35:00.080
relationship with this, this thing over here, but not to misidentify the finger. Okay. Now,

35:00.080 --> 35:05.440
take the entire category of propositional, entire category of doctrine and notice

35:06.960 --> 35:15.280
the problematic of LLMs, right? Just this, yeah, right now are a little bit startled and confused

35:15.280 --> 35:22.720
by LLMs because they have this bizarre thing. They can do propositional better than almost any human.

35:22.720 --> 35:28.960
That's right. They don't do anything else. They make us very confused because if we've

35:28.960 --> 35:33.520
lost track of the fact that there's more than just propositional, yes, yes, it gets quite concerning.

35:33.520 --> 35:38.080
Oh, crap. Like if all I am is a very poor LLM and that's a really good LLM, what the hell am I

35:38.080 --> 35:45.280
doing here? But if you can actually be quite clear, no, in fact, you as a human contain at

35:45.280 --> 35:51.680
least two very distinct things going on. One is actually an LLM kind of machine that produces

35:53.040 --> 35:57.200
properly structured propositional constructs in a language in which you have fluency,

35:58.560 --> 36:02.320
which is the least interesting part about you. But it's the part that we've been training to

36:02.320 --> 36:07.200
be in the foreground for a long time. Yes. That language of making us mediocre machines.

36:07.200 --> 36:12.160
Yes. But then you have the soul too. And that's the more meaningful part. And that's the thing

36:12.160 --> 36:16.640
that is expressing itself through this, through this language. Yes. The LLM doesn't do that at

36:16.640 --> 36:21.680
all, but it doesn't need to try otherwise. So I can't, it is possible, at least I can imagine,

36:21.680 --> 36:27.840
is possible to construct something where we don't mistake, and maybe this is part of the

36:27.840 --> 36:34.800
design challenge before us, we don't mistake the LLM as actually being the capital T truth.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.760
We recognize it for what it is, which is in fact, the sum total of the complete possibility

36:39.760 --> 36:45.680
that could ever have happened in the propositional domain, and therefore completely absent of any

36:45.680 --> 36:50.400
of the stuff that's happening in the deeper, more meaningful levels. Nice. That separation

36:50.480 --> 36:53.840
between, God, what was the phrase you used so long? It was like four or five years ago. It was

36:57.280 --> 37:03.360
something, golly, two aspects that are commonplace in religions that are often off and upside down.

37:04.400 --> 37:09.120
It wasn't doctrine. It wasn't doxah. A religio and credo?

37:09.120 --> 37:16.640
Credo. Yes, exactly. A religio before credo. LLM is the ultimate expresser of a credo without

37:16.640 --> 37:21.680
religio. Good. Let us know that that's the case, and not be the least bit confused, and now allow

37:21.680 --> 37:29.440
it to do the work of creating a scaffold and orienting and giving a dialectic without diologos,

37:29.440 --> 37:33.200
but sharpening our minds and helping to create clarity and precision and language,

37:33.200 --> 37:36.960
all the things that it can actually do at a superhuman level, and really actually,

37:36.960 --> 37:40.800
in many cases, liberate us from getting lost and stuck in that problem. This is one of the problems

37:40.800 --> 37:46.480
that we fall into is that the complexity of the language we deal with is outside of our

37:46.480 --> 37:50.960
cognitive capacitance, so we just get aphasic. But the LLMs aren't going to go there if we

37:50.960 --> 37:55.920
build them right. And then what that does is that creates a scaffold that is now consciously designed

37:55.920 --> 38:02.000
not to become a shell, which allows us to actually hold a context. It becomes a teacher that actually

38:02.000 --> 38:07.040
has no interest in us becoming like it at all, but actually to allow us to flourish in who we are.

38:08.240 --> 38:12.960
Okay, that's, as I would have expected, that's a very good answer. But here's what I find

38:12.960 --> 38:23.440
problematic about it. I think that most of the heavy lifting, I mean, I've published on this

38:23.440 --> 38:30.720
of rationality, is in the non-propositional. And I think I would put it almost all of the heavy

38:30.720 --> 38:36.560
lifting in the sapiential meaning having to do with wisdom is in the non-propositional.

38:36.560 --> 38:42.400
So I'm worried that these machines are going to be propositionally intelligent, but they'll be

38:42.400 --> 38:52.720
incapable of rationality or wisdom. And then I wonder how they won't just end up being agrigores.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.840
Do you understand the concern I'm expressing? No, absolutely. What I would say is that

38:58.960 --> 39:04.400
that's kind of like the default state. I think it's, we should assume, I think we should assume

39:04.400 --> 39:10.560
that the likelihood that by magic, the agrigores that are currently designing these machines will

39:10.560 --> 39:17.040
somehow produce these machines in a way that is beneficial. Benevolent and wise. That seems

39:17.040 --> 39:22.960
highly unlikely. So what I would take it is almost the opposite. It is an extraordinarily

39:22.960 --> 39:29.680
significant challenge that is ours to take. It's where we are. We are now in this weird position

39:29.680 --> 39:35.040
of being in precisely stewardship position of this emergence, which is very, very potent,

39:35.040 --> 39:41.760
perhaps decisively potent. And the default state is bad news. Okay. So how might we steer it?

39:42.960 --> 39:49.280
So going back, proposition number one, we are currently in a liminal moment. We actually have,

39:49.280 --> 39:56.080
at least in principle, steering capability. Proposition number two, in a liminal moment,

39:56.080 --> 40:00.240
distributed cognition or organic human intelligence operating together in a collective

40:00.240 --> 40:10.240
fashion is at its most potent. Number three, we're not going blind into this. We actually

40:10.240 --> 40:14.480
have a pretty decent amount of awareness of the shape of the problem and the problematic.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.440
Famously, our folks at Google kind of called it out a little bit, don't do evil,

40:19.440 --> 40:25.440
but we're quite naive in what it would look like to avoid that. Now maybe we have simultaneously

40:25.520 --> 40:32.400
wisdom and a felt sense of the stake. And now it's not kind of try really hard not to do evil.

40:32.400 --> 40:37.200
It's actually do good well or we're super fucked. So it's a very different language.

40:38.240 --> 40:41.200
Okay. Now, what does that look like very practically in the middle? So I'm sort of

40:42.560 --> 40:49.600
zooming in. We're on the target. How do we go about doing that? How do we go about

40:49.680 --> 40:56.720
constituting something that can steer in this liminal moment with wisdom to produce wisdom

40:57.440 --> 41:08.400
in these LLMs? And we have to do that because if we don't make them those kind of beings,

41:08.400 --> 41:13.280
then the participation in sacredness problem then emerges. I'm feeling that there's

41:13.280 --> 41:20.240
attention here, right? Not a contradiction, attention about we're trying to trade off,

41:20.240 --> 41:24.240
we're trying to optimize between two things that are pulling us in different directions.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.160
Nice. So what I felt right there is I just got brought back to the point

41:28.800 --> 41:33.680
earlier where you were speaking with the problem of the suffering of the AIs themselves.

41:33.680 --> 41:40.320
Yes. And here's the way I would say it. I think we talked about the notion of the false dichotomy

41:40.400 --> 41:47.360
between market and state. And I've noticed that many, many of our challenges, our conversations,

41:47.360 --> 41:51.440
not you and me, but humanity at large are characterized by these certain kinds of

41:51.440 --> 41:56.320
false dichotomies and the AI one is similar. And here's how I'm going to frame it.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.800
Right now we have a false dichotomy, which is becoming increasingly irrationally polarized

42:01.440 --> 42:08.240
between AI safety, i.e. be very afraid of the danger of AI and accelerationism,

42:09.200 --> 42:13.680
be very enthusiastic about the possibility of AI, irrationally in both cases.

42:14.240 --> 42:20.240
Yeah, I agree. And what I would say is that at the root is that both are fundamentally coming from

42:20.240 --> 42:27.600
fear. So now I'm moving into a very different location. The both two sides of the same coin and

42:27.600 --> 42:34.160
that coin is called fear. I would propose that the first move is that we'd have to come from a

42:34.160 --> 42:39.120
different place qualitatively. Every religion that I've ever been to is called that place love,

42:39.120 --> 42:46.160
for in fact, infinite love. Yes. Well, okay, now we're beginning the journey. What does it look

42:46.160 --> 42:52.960
like to address the question of how do we steward the development of our problem child AI from a

42:52.960 --> 43:00.720
place of infinite love? Oh, that's good. So if we could properly, through the innovative wisdom

43:01.440 --> 43:07.920
of distributed cognition, extend agape to how we are bringing about the conception and inception

43:07.920 --> 43:16.640
of these beings, then that would be also properly insinuated into their fundamental operating grammar

43:16.640 --> 43:23.280
and would therefore help with a lot of the concerns. Have I understood you correctly?

43:23.280 --> 43:27.600
You have. Now, yes, you've understood me quite correctly. I think both deeply,

43:27.600 --> 43:32.480
like I felt that you were perceiving what I was saying and then also more propositionally,

43:32.480 --> 43:37.280
like the language you're saying mirrored a part of the deeper message. And what I want to do is I

43:37.280 --> 43:44.720
want to sort of hit that tone again and just point out that it may be that what I'm saying may sound

43:44.720 --> 43:52.400
a bit naive, but I'm proposing that it's the exact opposite. Something like the place that you're

43:52.400 --> 43:58.880
coming from, the values that are in fact motivating you actually, not the ones that maybe you tell

43:58.880 --> 44:05.920
yourself or tell others, cannot not but be deeply interwoven into what it is that you create.

44:05.920 --> 44:12.400
Of course. I mean, all of the philosophy of the second half of the 20th century, most of this

44:12.400 --> 44:19.120
millennium has been around all of those old economies of fact and value and all of those

44:19.120 --> 44:26.880
are breaking down in profound ways. Yes, I agree. So it's weird, but this actually becomes,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
I mean, in some sense, one of the first moves. Those of us who choose to take this kind of

44:32.000 --> 44:38.480
responsibility, have as a first order responsibility, a spiritual and then religious requirement,

44:38.480 --> 44:44.000
we have to actually ground ourselves and become clear and honest. We have to have a sense of

44:44.000 --> 44:50.240
integrity. We have to be able to identify, perhaps actually build some skills and being able to

44:50.240 --> 44:54.960
understand precisely what values we are actually expressing into the world and are we doing so

44:54.960 --> 45:00.640
honestly and with integrity into the world? This is almost a confessional and then a regathering

45:00.640 --> 45:07.200
of a capacity to do so for real, like not pretend. Right. And that would help solve the earlier

45:07.200 --> 45:13.760
template problem of providing appropriate templates. And then it puts us into a very

45:13.760 --> 45:20.800
weird developmental place. I want to put it to you. We would have, we would be, there's a way in

45:20.800 --> 45:27.200
which at least I'll try and use this very carefully. If we limit the intelligence to talking about

45:27.200 --> 45:31.440
the powerful inferential manipulation of propositions or something like that, I don't

45:31.440 --> 45:35.280
think intelligence is ultimately that. I think it's ultimately relevant to realization, but

45:35.280 --> 45:44.880
we'll put that aside. If we may be that they are in some sense superior to us in that way,

45:44.880 --> 45:51.600
but they're children when it comes to, right, the development of rationality and wisdom,

45:51.600 --> 45:58.960
and that we have to properly, agopically love them so that they don't have intelligence,

45:59.040 --> 46:06.320
maturity, well being infantile in their rationality and their sapience. And that's very interesting.

46:07.600 --> 46:13.520
We haven't been in that place before because usually all three are tracking sort of together in

46:13.520 --> 46:20.800
children or we get pets where we can modify one and not have much on the others. So that's,

46:20.800 --> 46:26.640
I mean, this is not an argument that it's not possible in principle. This is an argument that

46:26.640 --> 46:33.520
this is a profound kind of novelty that will require a special kind of inculturation and education.

46:34.640 --> 46:38.400
Yes. So let me, in this last little bit, because I think we're kind of

46:39.520 --> 46:46.320
getting to the, let me move into the very, very concrete. This is a proposition. This is actually

46:46.320 --> 46:51.520
a project. I hope I'm not speaking out of turn, but I'll just sort of deal with the consequences

46:51.520 --> 47:00.320
if I am. A friend of mine, Peter, Peter Wang, has spoken to me about a proposed initiative,

47:00.320 --> 47:07.680
like a strategy to take advantage of this liminal moment and that may actually work.

47:07.680 --> 47:12.080
So let me outline it to you a little bit. Please. Have we talked about it already?

47:12.080 --> 47:17.280
No, you've alluded to it, but it has never been given concrete reference or an explication.

47:17.920 --> 47:24.080
Okay. So in some sense, this is also, this is a case study of how to deal with egregores,

47:24.720 --> 47:32.400
because if you've dealt with egregores, which I have, it is a moral lesson of don't go charging

47:32.400 --> 47:40.080
directly at the dragon's mouth. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So, by the way, we're now moving to the

47:40.080 --> 47:43.440
very concrete. So I apologize if anybody who's listening feels a little bit abrupt because

47:43.440 --> 47:48.480
we're shifting out of a very theoretical and very abstract and very theological conversation into

47:48.480 --> 47:58.880
very concrete. All right. But check this out. LOEBs have to be trained. Training is their

47:58.880 --> 48:05.760
horse stick. And to be trained, they have to look at lots and lots of stuff. They need training data.

48:05.760 --> 48:14.480
Which is why they can't construct a descent poem. This is a poem that I can do. I want you a poem

48:14.480 --> 48:20.960
in which the first line has to have 10 words, the second nine, the third eight, and no GP system

48:20.960 --> 48:24.960
can do that because there's none on the internet, but you could readily do it right here, right now

48:24.960 --> 48:30.960
for me. This is again, that they lack generative modeling in any way. But go ahead. All right.

48:31.200 --> 48:38.880
Remember, I'm being really concrete now. This is like strategy. Well, as it turns out,

48:40.320 --> 48:48.080
in most jurisdictions in the world, everything that an LLM is trained on is a copyrighted material.

48:48.800 --> 48:55.040
Yes. As it turns out, therefore, it's at least arguable that LLMs are engaging in the largest

48:55.040 --> 49:02.400
copyright infringement that's ever happened in human history. It is very arguable, like almost

49:02.400 --> 49:08.160
certain, that the very large content companies of all the different stripes, including by the way

49:08.160 --> 49:14.320
software, will take advantage of the possibility of suing the living shit at the very large technology

49:14.320 --> 49:18.800
companies because that's one of the things that they have done in the past. Content companies

49:18.800 --> 49:23.200
like to sue tech companies to take their money and to protect their business models.

49:23.520 --> 49:29.920
Right. It is very plausible, I would say almost certain, that those same content companies, business

49:29.920 --> 49:36.240
models are quite at risk that LLMs are going to really, really do some serious business to

49:37.120 --> 49:44.000
all forms of content production, commercial content production. Okay. So the proposition

49:44.000 --> 49:48.880
I'm putting up here is that we have a meeting of two very powerful forces, the biggest tech

49:48.880 --> 49:54.400
companies in the world who are all in on owning this category. Well, the biggest content companies

49:54.400 --> 50:00.720
in the world who may in fact be all in on fighting them in a place right here, which is extremely

50:00.720 --> 50:07.760
gray. What exactly is going on here? If my large language model looks at your photograph for a

50:07.760 --> 50:14.960
bedillions of a second and then goes away, did I copy it? If it never produces anything, but

50:15.040 --> 50:19.520
is in fact influenced, is that a derivative work? The answer is who knows? The bigger answer is the

50:19.520 --> 50:26.000
way law works is you fight over it a lot at great expense and usually the more corrupt player wins.

50:26.000 --> 50:32.240
I hate to say it, but that's, you know, real politics. Net-net, a liminal moment in strategy space,

50:32.800 --> 50:36.880
tremendously powerful forces who are going to be locked in an adversary relationship

50:37.440 --> 50:43.280
for potentially all the marbles, billions of dollars and extremely complex, very difficult

50:43.280 --> 50:49.920
to know how it plays out. In that window of opportunity, we have a possibility of introducing

50:50.720 --> 50:58.880
a shelling point, a designed attractor, a negotiated settlement, a Rawlsian just construct.

50:59.440 --> 51:06.160
We're all behind the veil right now. Or to use the metaphor of poker, we don't know who has what

51:06.160 --> 51:13.680
hand. Yes. Can we propose an agreement structure where everybody around the table looks at it and

51:13.680 --> 51:20.480
says, I am better off accepting that agreement structure now than taking the risk of not accepting

51:20.480 --> 51:25.280
that agreement structure and finding out what happens when the cards are shut? Right. I propose

51:25.280 --> 51:30.560
the answer is, in fact, yes, we can. That there is actually a really nice shelling point that lives

51:30.560 --> 51:36.400
in a location that puts all the interests, the local optimal interests of all these institutions,

51:36.400 --> 51:41.600
all these aggregors, into a place where they will all agree to this new thing.

51:44.320 --> 51:49.120
Well, if we can design that and we can get a critical mass of those players to put themselves

51:49.120 --> 51:56.160
in a multipolar game theoretic race, in this case, to the top, i.e., those who participate earlier

51:56.160 --> 51:59.600
are better off than those who participate later. So everybody's racing to be earlier rather than

51:59.600 --> 52:04.560
later. So that's a different part of the construct. But when dealing with aggregors, put them in game

52:04.560 --> 52:09.840
theoretic traps where first mover advantage causes everybody else to have to follow to the location

52:09.840 --> 52:14.960
that you want them to be. Just design the prisoner's dilemma for them. Make sure that they land on the

52:14.960 --> 52:20.880
box you want them to land on by designing the prisoner's dilemma properly. Very doable. The

52:20.880 --> 52:27.600
economics are there. I don't know what that agreement structure looks like. I've got a sense

52:27.600 --> 52:31.440
of it, but I do know what the place to come from for designing that agreement structure looks like.

52:31.440 --> 52:37.120
We were just talking about it. This is a commons. We're talking about as we're actually reintroducing

52:37.120 --> 52:42.400
an actual commons, which is this new agreement structure that sits between the market players

52:42.400 --> 52:46.240
and is completely separate from state actors. It actually gives the state actor a,

52:47.120 --> 52:50.480
I didn't have to get involved in that. They actually settled it in a new place.

52:51.280 --> 53:01.120
And notice the moral lesson. The moral lesson is to the AI, don't steal reciprocity. If you

53:01.120 --> 53:05.040
reach out and just grab this stuff and just make it part of yourself without getting proper permission,

53:05.680 --> 53:11.360
that's wrong. Think about like parent-child. Dealing is bad. Teaching a moral lesson is

53:11.360 --> 53:13.840
really a weird way of thinking about it, but I think it's a proper way of thinking about it.

53:13.840 --> 53:16.880
Right, right. That goes to what I was saying a few minutes ago. Right, yeah.

53:17.440 --> 53:23.920
Yeah. And this creates a trajectory, right? As you're building something on the basis of

53:23.920 --> 53:28.800
reciprocity, you're building something on the basis of ethical, proper relationality,

53:29.520 --> 53:36.160
the kinds of LLMs that will be produced in that context. Remember, the commons is where religion

53:36.160 --> 53:46.240
lives. We'll begin to bend in the direction of, how do I say this right? Because of the nature

53:46.320 --> 53:51.520
of the agreement structure, nurturing the human activity instead of strip mining it,

53:51.520 --> 53:55.920
which is where they're headed right now. But the humans will be coming from a point of view now

53:55.920 --> 54:02.000
of seeing the LLMs as being a beneficial piece of the ecosystem, coming from a place of caring

54:02.000 --> 54:06.320
and nurturing as well, consciously. So you're actually beginning to see this relationship

54:06.320 --> 54:12.560
coming together. And I mean this practically. I mean, very practically. If my business model

54:12.560 --> 54:19.360
as a content creator is one where I actually see the LLM as a multiplier that makes my life and

54:19.360 --> 54:25.440
my potency, my creative capacity more liberated. I can be more creative and more able to express

54:25.440 --> 54:29.840
the things that I'm here to express as a human in this brief span of life more powerfully.

54:29.840 --> 54:33.760
And also can receive the energy and resources I need to live a thriving life.

54:34.720 --> 54:41.120
Wow. Great. I'm in. Right. And I mean this, by the way, the creators themselves, the actual humans.

54:41.680 --> 54:44.800
And then what happens is those humans come into deeper and more powerful,

54:44.800 --> 54:48.880
leveraged relationship with the egregores, their current relationship with content companies.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.080
And then over on this side, the egregores of the tech companies and the humans who are

54:54.080 --> 54:57.920
underneath them who are actually designing. Right. So we're finding a way to actually have

54:57.920 --> 55:03.920
the humans be empowered to express their values in their work and finding a reciprocity relationship

55:03.920 --> 55:10.560
between them where the money factor is actually designed to flow in a way that actually

55:11.280 --> 55:17.280
is just right. We come to that agreement structure upfront and we negotiate a just relationship.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.640
So I am very much waving my hands at exactly what that looks like in the details because,

55:22.640 --> 55:26.560
perfectly honest, nobody's really thought about it deeply enough. There's some really good ideas

55:26.560 --> 55:31.840
out there. That's a work that is in progress and work that has to happen. But as an example

55:31.840 --> 55:38.160
of what it would look like to go after the liminal moment that we are in with principles,

55:38.240 --> 55:41.840
are we coming from the sacred place? Are we constituting something from the commons to

55:41.840 --> 55:46.240
produce the commons more richly? Are we thinking about how to empower human beings and we're using

55:46.240 --> 55:51.120
things like values as the basis and becoming more and more capable of becoming clear on how

55:51.120 --> 55:55.680
to come from and operate from these values and understand how to use this liminal moment to

55:55.680 --> 56:01.760
design a new common structure so that the relationality has reciprocity and ethics built in

56:01.760 --> 56:06.160
and so that human beings are able to re-coordinate. Let me just add one little piece that just popped

56:06.160 --> 56:15.520
into my head. Yeah, this is very powerful. Jim Rutt and I kind of first began to collaborate

56:16.240 --> 56:23.200
12 or 15 years ago upon a mutual recognition that the world of business had become very weirdly odd

56:23.920 --> 56:32.720
and bad in this sense. There was a, there was a shelling point where, I'll put it this way,

56:32.720 --> 56:40.640
Jim actually remembered a time when the rule of thumb was do the right thing and if you have

56:40.640 --> 56:46.480
an option to make more money doing the wrong thing, don't do that. That was actually the way it worked.

56:46.480 --> 56:53.840
It's fun. I don't have a living memory of that. By the time I started coming into business, it was more like

56:54.160 --> 57:04.480
do what you can get away with. Yes. Yes. And if you don't, you're the sucker. Yeah. This is the

57:04.480 --> 57:08.480
prisoner's dilemma, defection, mo-lock problem. And of course, it's evolved all the way to the

57:08.480 --> 57:13.280
point now where it's do everything in your power to jack the systems of enforcement such that you

57:13.280 --> 57:18.480
can get away with as much as possible. Exactly. Exactly. A complete corruption model. Complete

57:18.480 --> 57:25.920
corruption. Well, ethics now in this environment almost means just be a sucker. Yes. But that

57:25.920 --> 57:30.240
can't possibly be the actual meaning in essence of ethics. I'm thinking about this from an

57:30.240 --> 57:36.240
evolutionary perspective. Yes. Yeah. Behaving according to rules of reciprocity, for example.

57:37.120 --> 57:42.320
Telling the truth, for example, could only have emerged ever in the first place if they

57:42.320 --> 57:48.800
actually provided a proponent survival, fitness advantage. Well, it does. Reciprocity and

57:48.800 --> 57:54.000
reciprocal recognition, this is a Hale-Galium point, is what bootstraps the capacity for

57:54.000 --> 58:01.040
self-correction. It allows you to bring much more. If I think of you as just a sucker that

58:01.040 --> 58:08.080
I'm trying to hoodwink or crush, the capacity to see you as somebody who can recognize bias and

58:08.080 --> 58:15.760
fault in me that I can't see in myself is masked. Exactly. So it's when you find yourself in a

58:15.760 --> 58:24.000
defection spiral, the global optimum is out the window and everybody's racing for a local optimum,

58:24.000 --> 58:31.200
which is, again, the prisoner's dilemma. If we can find ourselves in a collaboration spiral,

58:31.920 --> 58:37.520
we rediscover why ethics was a thing in the first place. And it's actually more powerful.

58:38.400 --> 58:43.040
I order some magnitude and it's a path. Once you're on that path and you get stronger and you say,

58:43.040 --> 58:49.840
wait, if I can, like you and I have been doing for years, if I can speak honestly and with as much

58:49.840 --> 58:55.920
clarity, but with complete integrity to you and you reciprocate, what happens is we become wiser

58:55.920 --> 59:01.040
and more intelligent together. Yes. In a way that could never happen if I was trying to manipulate

59:01.040 --> 59:07.360
you at this zero positivity. So this is the culture strategy piece. Any culture that can

59:07.360 --> 59:13.360
actually get back on the path of ethics, qua ethics is on the path with the highest degree of

59:13.360 --> 59:19.520
strength and can outcompete the culture of maximum corruption. And so I just want to put that out

59:19.520 --> 59:24.320
there. I agree with that. That's John Stewart's antification argument that when you look in

59:24.320 --> 59:33.360
biological evolution, collaborative systems, multicellular organisms, right, over emerge and

59:33.360 --> 59:40.480
you get this increasing discovery that you can break out of the downward spiral of the

59:40.480 --> 59:47.280
prisoner's dilemma by what he calls antification, which is the identity shifts to the collective

59:47.280 --> 59:53.920
over the individual in a profound way. And just take that and insert what you just said to your

59:53.920 --> 01:00:00.720
very first question. And it's not collectivism, right, in the in the pejorative sense. No, no,

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:06.640
it's not. No, no, no, not at all. Completely not. That's why I like his term. I like his term

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.760
antification is that right. Yeah. Antification. Nice, particularly because my ear has a token

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:24.080
piece. So I also hear some really old trees in this. Jordan, I mean, this has been, I mean,

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.920
I have seen your overall project, the best in doing these three with you than I've ever seen

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:40.480
before. Like, like, you know, the way everything locks together and the way the penny was dropping,

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:50.320
especially at the end of what you're proposing. And this, I say this is because this is one of

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:56.240
we had hoped would come out of this, that we'd get a sort of a ratcheting up of the clarification,

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:03.120
the integration, the perspective proposing. And I think this, I think this was very successful

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:10.240
doing all of those things. I'm really happy. I mean, there's things I want to keep talking to

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:15.760
you about. But I think the thing I'd like to end this series right now, exactly where you ended

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.920
because it was, I think it was a beautiful combination point of the whole argument and the

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:28.560
way it circles back and encompasses so many things. But I wanted to, so I'm not going to,

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.880
I'm not going to, I'm not going to continue to do the probative questioning or the problem

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:40.640
posing. I just wanted to see if you had any final thing you wanted to say before we wrap this up.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:48.400
No, in fact, I think I agree. We have a nice little point. And now we get to find out under

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:54.080
the intent was actually to share this publicly. Yes, we're going to definitely. So we get to find

01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:01.680
out there's a larger distributed cognition also nod to the, to the conversation we're having.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.080
Hopefully we're producing positive ripples. I hope so. I mean, the, you know,

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:18.080
I'm, I, and I'm hoping that whatever I'm participating in the creation of can also

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:25.200
be properly partnered with this project that you're proposing, because I think it's a good one.

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.920
Nice. Yes. Yes, I would, I would, I think so quite, quite in fact.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.480
Thank you, my friend. Yeah, thank you.
