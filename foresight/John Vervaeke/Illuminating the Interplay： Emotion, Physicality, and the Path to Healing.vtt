00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Reveke.

00:02.800 --> 00:04.640
I'm very excited about this.

00:04.640 --> 00:08.000
We're back again with Teri Dentry and her ongoing work

00:08.000 --> 00:10.800
and this ongoing video series.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.480
Many of you have been reaching out

00:12.480 --> 00:14.680
about wanting to participate in this work

00:14.680 --> 00:15.880
in one way or another.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.520
And I wanted to, I'll do this again,

00:17.520 --> 00:21.360
but I wanted to thank many of you for your interest in that.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.680
We also have Aspezia Gera George with us,

00:23.680 --> 00:26.680
and she already knows Teri.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.360
I've just, before we turn on the camera,

00:29.520 --> 00:32.080
I've been getting to know her, she's very charming.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.120
And I look forward to us opening this up,

00:36.120 --> 00:40.680
getting back into these deep issues around chronic pain,

00:40.680 --> 00:43.360
the medic crisis, the meeting crisis,

00:43.360 --> 00:46.360
and issues around, you know,

00:46.360 --> 00:48.200
interprofessional practice,

00:48.200 --> 00:49.720
dialogical reasoning.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.760
Many of these topics,

00:50.760 --> 00:53.720
we're weaving them all together in powerful ways.

00:53.720 --> 00:57.040
And Aspezia is going to give us

00:57.120 --> 01:01.320
more of a clinical therapeutic dimension,

01:01.320 --> 01:03.200
but I mentioned she'll also want to talk about

01:03.200 --> 01:05.800
some of these far-reaching dimensions.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.400
So welcome, both ladies.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.280
And I'll turn things over to Teri.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.440
Thank you, John.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.920
That was a great introduction.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.320
And I also welcome Aspezia.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.520
I've got to know Aspezia over the last 12 months.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.520
Again, someone I've met through VoiceCraft.

01:20.520 --> 01:24.120
So a wonderful place to actually meet like-minded people.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.920
And yeah, through our discussions, our earlier discussions,

01:28.920 --> 01:30.440
we were talking about, of course,

01:30.440 --> 01:33.200
my research work in chronic pain.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.800
And Aspezia has a clinical background

01:36.800 --> 01:39.840
and works as a clinical psychologist.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.440
And we've come to understand

01:42.440 --> 01:46.160
that we have some very similar feelings and thoughts

01:46.160 --> 01:48.600
when we do think about chronic pain,

01:48.600 --> 01:52.040
and especially the term socialization of pain,

01:52.160 --> 01:55.080
which is something that John and I have been talking about

01:55.080 --> 01:56.160
to quite some length.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.440
And I'm really excited to talk to Aspezia about that today

01:59.440 --> 02:02.800
and actually how potentially rationality

02:02.800 --> 02:05.800
fits into the way that we actually think

02:05.800 --> 02:08.520
about that socialization of pain.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.600
So I'm going to let Aspezia introduce herself and her work.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.480
Thank you, Teri.

02:15.480 --> 02:17.720
It's a real pleasure to be here with you both.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.760
And John, I did just want to say that

02:21.760 --> 02:24.720
you've formed a very important part of my life.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.720
It's really wonderful to finally meet you.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.840
I think it must have been like six years ago with my baby son.

02:31.840 --> 02:33.600
He had trouble sleeping.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.600
And I used to listen to your lectures

02:35.600 --> 02:40.480
when I was pacing back and forth all night exhausted.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.680
And so to meet you is really special.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.600
So I just wanted to start with that

02:45.600 --> 02:46.920
and to thank you for that.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.360
Thank you.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.040
So yes, I'm a clinical psychologist.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.160
I'm a therapist.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.200
I see people in private practice.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.480
I use a modality called ISTDP.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.920
So it's a psychoanalytically informed modality.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.880
It's very emotion focused.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.560
It's experiential.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.480
So it's all about creating experience in the room with patients.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.240
And it wasn't designed for chronic pain.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.880
It was designed really for depression, anxiety,

03:18.880 --> 03:20.960
personality disorders, that sort of thing.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.560
But it can be used for chronic pain.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.280
So it also relieves chronic pain and somatization

03:27.280 --> 03:29.440
and an array of things.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.600
And we can talk about why.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.040
So I'm, yeah, I'm interested in talking about that in some depth.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.600
I'm interested more broadly in the role of emotions.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.120
I think there's a forgotten landscape.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.520
I think there's an over focus on rationality, cognitions.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.560
And we forget, we forget the emotional landscape

03:50.560 --> 03:52.640
and how to take that into account.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.960
And I think that happens from very early on in life

03:55.960 --> 03:58.800
for reasons we can talk about, but also socially.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.160
I just think it's reinforced socially in the culture.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.080
I don't think there's a strong enough understanding

04:05.080 --> 04:07.760
of what emotions are, how they can be helpful,

04:08.080 --> 04:10.840
how they can be enlivening.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.000
Particular emotions are prioritized over others.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.680
So we can talk about that in a lot of depth.

04:18.520 --> 04:21.520
And also the socialization of pain I'm very interested in.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.960
The idea that, well, what I see all the time

04:25.280 --> 04:28.720
that chronic pain, as well as depression, as well as anxiety,

04:28.760 --> 04:31.520
all of these sufferings, these undue sufferings

04:32.120 --> 04:34.720
actually play a role in relationship.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.640
And this role that they play in relationship reinforces

04:37.880 --> 04:40.480
the symptoms themselves.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.720
And there's a few different ways that I can talk about that.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.800
And probably in some ways that it may be different

04:45.800 --> 04:49.600
to what you've already considered in your conversations.

04:50.600 --> 04:55.000
I think because the model is psychoanalytically informed,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.520
there's a lot of focus on the unconscious

04:57.520 --> 05:00.480
and the role of suppression and repression

05:01.960 --> 05:04.760
and trying to bring the unconscious up into consciousness

05:04.760 --> 05:06.880
as a way to relieve the suffering,

05:06.880 --> 05:08.960
which I think is a really important part of the mix

05:09.680 --> 05:10.960
for a subset of people.

05:10.960 --> 05:17.200
I think more CBT and sort of very general emotional work is enough.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.240
But for many, many people,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.160
there is a lot of unconscious resistance

05:21.160 --> 05:23.280
against experiencing their emotions

05:24.480 --> 05:26.560
and so that they're not aware of.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.160
And so taking time to help them understand

05:29.160 --> 05:32.760
what those defenses against emotional experience are is vital.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.120
And without that, what can often happen

05:35.120 --> 05:37.080
is that symptoms can just move around.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.880
So someone gets some relief to their pain, for example,

05:41.160 --> 05:43.560
but it may be that it manifests somewhere else later on in life

05:43.840 --> 05:47.360
or it now manifests as anxiety in a different context

05:47.360 --> 05:51.040
or depression or sexual problems or all sorts of things.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.040
So so I'm interested, I guess, broadly in emotions,

05:56.040 --> 05:57.760
getting more of a platform,

05:57.760 --> 06:01.040
that is because of the work they do with ISTDP,

06:01.040 --> 06:03.680
which stands for intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy,

06:04.000 --> 06:10.160
the type of therapy developed by Dr. Davenle in the 60s, I believe.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.200
And it's a very, yeah, we can get into the details of it.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
But essentially, it looks at

06:18.320 --> 06:20.960
it would look at chronic pain as being a defense

06:20.960 --> 06:23.520
against emotional experience.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.320
And so it's another way that we can avoid

06:26.760 --> 06:28.880
particularly painful emotional experience

06:28.880 --> 06:30.920
that our psyche, for whatever reason,

06:30.920 --> 06:34.760
has decided is too dangerous or threatening to bring into relationship.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.480
So for us to even be aware of internally

06:37.480 --> 06:40.840
and then be to now, how is that going to impact the relationship?

06:40.840 --> 06:44.360
Will this person reject me, punish me, whatever it is for having this feeling?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.840
So all these defensive structures and mechanisms get created.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.360
And ISTDP is really about getting very clear

06:51.360 --> 06:53.920
on what the defensive mechanisms are that are in operation,

06:54.400 --> 06:57.160
bringing that into sort of stark relief for the patient,

06:57.800 --> 07:02.080
highlighting the internal emotional conflict that's going on,

07:02.080 --> 07:08.560
the intracyclic crisis and then helping to push through the resistance

07:08.560 --> 07:11.280
so that some of these feelings can come up and finally be experienced.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.920
And it gets experienced in the room together.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.440
And one more piece I will say is that I have found

07:20.400 --> 07:24.040
that the I think the most confronting part in the resistance

07:24.040 --> 07:26.760
that is greatest is the resistance against the impulse

07:27.160 --> 07:31.600
or the action impulse, the action tendency that comes with an emotional experience.

07:31.920 --> 07:35.480
So it's not just the sensation and the feeling itself in the body

07:35.880 --> 07:38.000
that is resisted against.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.640
In finally letting oneself experience that fully inside,

07:41.640 --> 07:45.200
there is an impulse that comes with it, which is the whole point of an emotion.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.560
And seeing that impulse, recognising that impulse inside ourselves

07:49.560 --> 07:51.040
can be very confronting.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.760
You know, if it's an aggressive impulse to reach out and hurt someone,

07:54.960 --> 07:56.520
that's a very confronting thing to look at.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.840
So there's a lot of resistance around seeing that part of it,

07:58.840 --> 08:01.920
but it's in the seeing that part of it, not the enacting,

08:02.160 --> 08:04.040
but just the noticing inside

08:05.320 --> 08:09.080
that can finally clear up the need for all these defences.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.320
Right. So it just clears up anxiety, clears up depressive symptomology.

08:13.320 --> 08:18.000
It can clear up chronic pain and opens a person up to

08:18.960 --> 08:22.680
also opens a person up to be able to experience their emotions more clearly

08:22.680 --> 08:27.360
and more fully. And that gives them greater potential in their action.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.720
That's what I've found. It gives them more options now.

08:29.720 --> 08:35.040
They have more information to draw from, to integrate with obviously cognitive,

08:35.040 --> 08:37.880
you know, rationale, bringing all that online with the emotions,

08:38.040 --> 08:41.840
working together as opposed to just looking at one part of it

08:42.040 --> 08:43.680
and pushing the emotions down.

08:43.680 --> 08:47.440
And I've said a lot all at once, but that's that's where I'm broadly

08:47.440 --> 08:50.120
interested in how I think it might be relevant.

08:50.120 --> 08:53.280
And I was saying to Terry, too, before this started that

08:54.160 --> 08:57.920
I'm also a researcher and actually I was a researcher before I was a clinician.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.160
So my mind also naturally goes to

09:02.280 --> 09:05.200
how can we like what are the practical implications here?

09:05.200 --> 09:08.040
What is it that we can take from this very complicated model?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.720
You know, that we're not going to be rolling out to everybody.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.760
What can we take from this?

09:12.760 --> 09:16.640
What are the key ingredients that might be useful to OTs, physios, GPs,

09:16.800 --> 09:20.360
you know, nurses, anyone that's coming into contact with someone with chronic pain?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.720
What can they take from it?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.720
So my mind is sort of in all those places at once.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.600
And just more more sort of broadly philosophically as well,

09:28.600 --> 09:32.080
because I've been I've been spending a lot of time at Boyscraft

09:32.080 --> 09:35.000
and those those generative

09:35.000 --> 09:37.600
conversations with that with that core group there.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.760
It's just it's just been wonderful when it's been.

09:39.760 --> 09:42.240
It's really opened me up to all of this in a new way as well.

09:42.240 --> 09:46.000
So those are all my different little lenses that I'm bringing to this.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.160
That was wonderful. Thank you.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.800
So you said it, you said about 20 very interesting things.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.440
So I'm afraid no matter which one I'll pick,

09:56.440 --> 10:00.560
it'll sound like I'm being negligent, but hopefully you'll be you'll be understanding.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.120
So I mean, I.

10:05.080 --> 10:09.320
I frequently say that for ECOGs, I should have two more E's added.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.240
Not only is emotion embodied, embedded, enacted and extended.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.160
It's also emotional and exacted.

10:17.160 --> 10:23.000
And so I and I think there's

10:23.520 --> 10:26.680
I've I've been making an argument for quite a long time

10:26.680 --> 10:30.560
about that that at the core of cognition is something called relevance

10:30.560 --> 10:33.880
realization, but relevance realization is not cold calculation.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.480
It involves caring and involves affect.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.800
It involves arousal, etc.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.240
So I think we're playing in the same ballpark, at least.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.560
So.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.040
In what way.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.120
Does everything you've said connect up with some of the stuff

10:54.120 --> 10:59.040
that Terry has been doing about the degree to which

10:59.240 --> 11:02.120
this is inculturated and socialized.

11:02.440 --> 11:07.080
I would, I, for example, you said you familiar

11:07.080 --> 11:11.520
at least with some of my work, you know, I think being stuck in a Cartesian framework

11:12.000 --> 11:16.440
has particularly exasperated and getting a very getting a very truncated

11:16.440 --> 11:20.640
notion of our rationality means where it goes from a very platonic notion

11:20.640 --> 11:25.000
down to this very logical notion and and their eros is drained out of it.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.320
Deliberately so, by the way, whereas Plato was a great emphasis

11:29.320 --> 11:31.320
on the relationality and the eros.

11:32.840 --> 11:37.920
So in what way does the sort of is the cultural cognitive grammar,

11:37.920 --> 11:38.920
the framework we're in.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.320
Does that I imagine that gets internalized, that that's an impact

11:44.320 --> 11:48.480
or that's an amplifier of the kinds of stuff you're talking about.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.480
Is that is that correct?

11:50.480 --> 11:51.480
How does that land?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.320
What like what comes up when I say that?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.320
Yeah, a lot comes up.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.120
And the answer is yes, that plays a role.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.520
And I see I see it play a role in just so many ways.

12:05.520 --> 12:10.520
First of all, I think I don't think there is there is a grammar for emotions

12:10.520 --> 12:11.520
out there.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.520
Like, I don't think people understand what we mean.

12:14.520 --> 12:20.120
At least as psychologists, when we say an emotion, people automatically go to action.

12:20.120 --> 12:26.320
So if I say to you what what is anger like for you, they go to, oh, it's, you know,

12:26.320 --> 12:30.920
someone lashing out or saying mean things or well, that's an action.

12:30.920 --> 12:35.320
And so the idea that there's even any sensation in the body is a beginning point is often

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
absent from people's minds.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.520
There's there's an idea, you know, this idea out there that we should be controlling our

12:43.520 --> 12:49.520
emotions, which again, really, I think people are talking about actions, but you can't you

12:49.520 --> 12:56.320
can't control the fact that these are biological hardwired signals that occur within us.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.320
We don't have choice over.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.720
Is absent seems to be absent from the mix.

13:00.720 --> 13:06.720
The idea that we that we generate our emotions, we can sort of curate and create this in a

13:06.720 --> 13:10.720
landscape of of joy and only being positive.

13:10.720 --> 13:18.720
All of that being reinforced by things like social media, but also just in family units.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.720
Like, I mean, it starts young.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.720
It's it's in the family unit.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.720
It's oftentimes in the schooling system.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.120
It's oftentimes in the schooling system.

13:27.120 --> 13:32.120
It's often what happens when you go to see a doctor.

13:32.120 --> 13:35.120
It's it's just in culture at large.

13:35.120 --> 13:42.120
And I think a lot of it is about that the prioritizing feeling good and looking like you're

13:42.120 --> 13:48.120
doing well and overriding overriding even just to divide between sort of positive and negative,

13:48.120 --> 13:50.120
you know, that some feelings are good and some are bad.

13:50.520 --> 13:55.520
And they're all vital signals inside us that can tell us something very important.

13:55.520 --> 14:02.520
They have a wisdom to them and that we don't take them seriously in that manner is a real problem.

14:05.520 --> 14:12.520
When it comes to pain specifically, it's quite often the case that people who I see

14:12.520 --> 14:19.520
who have chronic pain issues, once you can get very clear with them how interesting it is

14:19.720 --> 14:22.720
that they also seem to have an absence of emotional experience,

14:22.720 --> 14:26.720
but they have a lot of physical pain.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.720
That can be quite confronting in and of itself.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.720
Is that is that a general trend?

14:32.720 --> 14:36.720
I'm going to speak in a lot of generalities because there's always, you know, I don't want to act

14:36.720 --> 14:38.720
as though there aren't distinctions here.

14:38.720 --> 14:43.720
But yes, in a general sense, what happens is I guess from from an ISTP perspective,

14:43.720 --> 14:48.920
in some of these cases, you have to do I think one thing to say is you have to meet the individual

14:48.920 --> 14:49.920
in front of you.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.920
Of course, of course.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.920
It's very different.

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
But in general terms.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.920
Just take it that will give you charity around that.

14:55.920 --> 14:56.920
Okay.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.920
I hope others will as well.

14:58.920 --> 14:59.920
Yeah.

14:59.920 --> 15:00.920
Well, they should.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
They should.

15:01.920 --> 15:02.920
Okay.

15:02.920 --> 15:03.920
All right.

15:03.920 --> 15:04.920
I appreciate that.

15:04.920 --> 15:05.920
So in a general sense, yes.

15:05.920 --> 15:10.920
I mean, if we're thinking about from an ISTP perspective, if we're thinking about chronic pain here,

15:10.920 --> 15:16.920
operating as a defensive structure to keep the person from noticing that they're having a particular emotion,

15:16.920 --> 15:21.920
and we can talk about why, then they just notice the pain.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.920
The pain operates to keep them from noticing the emotion.

15:24.920 --> 15:32.920
So rather than notice the rage that I might feel towards my partner, right, for, I don't know,

15:32.920 --> 15:37.920
for deciding to leave their job and now putting me in a greater financial sort of burden,

15:37.920 --> 15:42.920
rather than notice that, all of a sudden I've developed some pain in my back, you know,

15:42.920 --> 15:52.920
and now so it's rather than, rather than notice the guilt that I might experience for doing

15:52.920 --> 15:55.920
something that ruptures my relationship with my child.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.920
I just noticed this sort of crushing pain in my, in my arms, right?

16:00.920 --> 16:04.920
Or I notice, you know, pain in my head or in my neck.

16:04.920 --> 16:11.920
So they notice the pain is replacement as a like a distraction from noticing the emotion that precedes it.

16:11.920 --> 16:17.920
So when you can, when you can draw it out and say, wow, you know, as we talk about this and look at the sort of the timeline of this,

16:17.920 --> 16:22.920
it seems like there were really, there were really difficult things happening in your life, you know,

16:22.920 --> 16:26.920
your mother passed away, you lost your job, like all these things.

16:26.920 --> 16:31.920
And then you develop this pain, but I hear nothing about how you felt about any of those things.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.920
I see.

16:32.920 --> 16:33.920
How did you feel?

16:33.920 --> 16:39.920
And to even just notice that they, that's almost the first time they've considered that question.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.920
And they say, oh, it didn't really bother me that much.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.920
You know, my mother had a great life.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.920
It was her time to go, you know, it's fine.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
I get it.

16:48.920 --> 16:49.920
I didn't really feel a lot.

16:49.920 --> 16:56.920
Or, you know, they give you some watery feeling or they're making it into a positive, positive feeling.

16:56.920 --> 17:05.920
You notice that you notice that it lacks the richness of an entire emotional landscape that one might imagine someone would experience if they were going through difficulty.

17:05.920 --> 17:10.920
So the pain, so it's like, it's like the same things we would say about anxiety and depression.

17:10.920 --> 17:18.920
It's sitting as a, as a cover, as a cover to keep this stuff squashed down so that the person themselves doesn't have contact with it,

17:18.920 --> 17:24.920
but also so even if they start to have contact with it, so that would never come out into the relationship.

17:24.920 --> 17:32.920
So that you would never let your partner know that you're very angry at them when they keep interrupting you, you know,

17:32.920 --> 17:35.920
and you've pointed it out to them several times and they continue to do it.

17:35.920 --> 17:41.920
That you feel a great anger inside when they do that, that you believe that that would never bring anything of value to the relationship.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.920
But what happens with these emotions is that we, they have to go somewhere.

17:44.920 --> 17:45.920
They have to do something.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.920
They have their own life.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.920
We can't just cut them off and throw them away.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.920
So they go underground and they fester and they come out in all sorts of other unconscious ways.

17:55.920 --> 18:01.920
And so some ways that we see that in, in ISTDP, especially when it comes to pain,

18:01.920 --> 18:10.920
is that the pain itself can be a rerouting of a rage and impulse to hurt someone else instead they experience it on themselves.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.920
So there's often, very often a link.

18:13.920 --> 18:20.920
Once we do all this work, there's very often a link between the precise location and nature of the pain they're experiencing

18:20.920 --> 18:30.920
and the initial impulse that came with the rage in the first place when they were younger, probably against an attachment figure.

18:30.920 --> 18:37.920
It's the same, it's the same expression, but they're expressed, it's being expressed in their body rather than to be inflicted on the other.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.920
It's a way they protect the other from an impulse to hurt the other.

18:41.920 --> 18:42.920
No.

18:42.920 --> 18:43.920
Does that make sense?

18:43.920 --> 18:45.920
Yeah, it does.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.920
And there's a couple.

18:46.920 --> 18:47.920
Oh, sorry.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.920
Am I interrupting you?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.920
So I just want to make sure.

18:52.920 --> 18:59.920
So part of what I'm hearing, there's three things I'm hearing.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.920
And you can respond to all or none of them or whatever order.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.920
I'm hearing like that there's both sort of a vertical dimension.

19:06.920 --> 19:16.920
You know, emotions are a signal about what's going on, but there's also this horizontal dimension of if I'm connected or not to external reality.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.920
Right.

19:17.920 --> 19:24.920
And either I'm trying to not admit something about the world or I'm trying to hold myself back from interacting with the world in a certain way.

19:24.920 --> 19:36.920
And this goes with sort of the idea of, which I think has got merit to it, that emotions are sort of this nexus between these two axes of connection, embodied connection and embedded connection.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.920
This is why I think the E of emotion should be added to embodied and embedded.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.920
So first of all, what you think about that.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.920
And then there was, I like this, this idea.

19:48.920 --> 19:57.920
I don't, I don't, I don't want to, I don't know quite what the word semiotic or symbolic that where it is, isn't just happenstance.

19:57.920 --> 20:07.920
There's some kind of meaning to it that and confronting the meaning is part of the issue as well.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.920
And then the third is a question.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.920
So those are my two observations.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.920
And please let me know if I'm tracking you well.

20:14.920 --> 20:22.920
And then the other one is, is it given sort of how we got into this with my original question.

20:22.920 --> 20:31.920
When you're doing therapy, is there an element of cultural critique that has to come up that you have to challenge people in terms of these cultural frameworks and give them the tools.

20:32.920 --> 20:40.920
Because like you said, they're going out and you're saying something for an hour in therapy and then they're going out with four hours on social media.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
And do you see what I'm saying?

20:42.920 --> 20:47.920
It sounds like it's in some ways the games rigged against you.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.920
And how do you deal with that?

20:49.920 --> 20:50.920
And what do you do?

20:50.920 --> 20:52.920
Do you have to do things, cultural critique?

20:52.920 --> 20:56.920
Do you have to empower them to challenge those cultural imperatives?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.920
So two observations and a question.

20:58.920 --> 20:59.920
I hope that wasn't too much.

20:59.920 --> 21:00.920
Oh, amazing.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.920
I'm going to start with the last one.

21:03.920 --> 21:17.920
Because what happens, John, is that if if when this is when this is done and it goes well from my point of view, it's all it's all about the individual and I in the room.

21:17.920 --> 21:18.920
Right.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.920
And it's it's less so about maybe like a CBT style.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.920
It's psycho education.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.920
Let's talk about the theory.

21:28.920 --> 21:34.920
It's all about trying to give the experience in the room to this person of what we're talking about.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.920
Right.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
To show them here and now together.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
Right.

21:38.920 --> 21:47.920
If we pay attention right now to your pain, what happens that using the relationship and using the here and now to give to help them see the gaps.

21:47.920 --> 21:54.920
And to see that actually something might be off here and the way I've been approaching this and understanding this everywhere else.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.920
But we keep it very much about the experience in the room.

21:57.920 --> 22:01.920
And I guess it's a corrective emotional experience that is taking place.

22:01.920 --> 22:02.920
And you're right.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.920
It is just one hour and they go back out into the world.

22:04.920 --> 22:12.920
But it is amazing how making it experiential in the room trans starts to translate out into the world anyway.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.920
Without me needing to say now you need to take this out and do that.

22:17.920 --> 22:30.920
Because otherwise the problem is otherwise you get into a game of talking and intellectualizing and an over rational and now you get into that same arena again that is part of the problem for many of these people.

22:30.920 --> 22:44.920
Part of their defensive structure is they like to think and talk about things and go up here a lot and make lots of connections in their brain without actually consulting their body first without going in and noticing what is that what is the truth of the emotion here.

22:44.920 --> 22:50.920
Even if I don't want to see it even if it's going to be disruptive to a relationship I'm in.

22:50.920 --> 22:59.920
And the part that you said at the end of your question about empowering them what generally happens is once we get on the other side of that in the room they are empowered themselves.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.920
I don't have to do anything.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.920
It opens up.

23:02.920 --> 23:08.920
There's this thing called the unconscious therapeutic alliance and it sort of takes over in this person.

23:08.920 --> 23:13.920
The healthy part just sort of takes over and they are opened up and they know what to do now.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.920
They are empowered.

23:14.920 --> 23:15.920
I don't give them any advice.

23:15.920 --> 23:20.920
I don't say to them oh you should probably leave your wife or not leave your wife or it's clear to them on the other side of it.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.920
They don't need me for that.

23:22.920 --> 23:28.920
They don't need another person in their life listing out the pros and cons of what you could do in the situation.

23:28.920 --> 23:42.920
Their problem is a blockage and access to vital signals that might help them to to see more clearly what is going on for them and in relationship and through seeing more clearly and having access to these more vital signals.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.920
They can integrate that into their thinking faculties which most of them have no problem with.

23:46.920 --> 23:53.920
The people I see John are highly intellectual people.

23:53.920 --> 23:57.920
They don't need more help from me about how to think.

23:57.920 --> 24:05.920
They oftentimes put all those pieces together themselves on the other side of it and that is beautiful to see because that actually is part of the healing.

24:05.920 --> 24:10.920
But they can say wow I can just figure that I figured this out now and I have I have agency in the world.

24:10.920 --> 24:17.920
I don't need my therapist to tell me what I should or shouldn't do in this relationship or how I how I should feel about social media.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.920
It's just clear to me now that yeah.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.920
Thank you for watching.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.920
You can find the link in the show notes.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.920
Yeah one pin in it quickly.

24:44.920 --> 24:53.920
So that last move really was helpful to me just before you address the other two that notion of sort of recovery or restoration of agency.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.920
That seems to be like an important thing.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.920
So that's what I was asking for.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.920
I wasn't necessarily like.

25:00.920 --> 25:10.920
I was like but something has changed such that they can go out and confront a world that is in some ways driven them into your into your office in the first place.

25:10.920 --> 25:23.920
And it sounds like there's a restoration of agency in some and this is a theme that Terry and I have been really trying to explore what that what that is and how that how that how that sort of comes online.

25:23.920 --> 25:30.920
I just wanted to put a pin in that because for me that that really helped me connect your answer to my question.

25:30.920 --> 25:36.920
But you wanted to respond to the other two points about emotion as the nexus and the symbolic aspect.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.920
Yes.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.920
But I'm tempted just to respond to the point you just made now as well.

25:42.920 --> 25:43.920
Do what you wish.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.920
Do what you wish.

25:44.920 --> 25:45.920
I will.

25:45.920 --> 25:52.920
It links really nicely to me with me to a conversation that I had with with Daniel Garner of OG Rose recently.

25:52.920 --> 25:59.920
We were talking about something similar to do with emotions and this distinction about about agency that you're talking about.

25:59.920 --> 26:12.920
So what it seems like to me happens is that in highlighting because really what we're doing in ISTP is we're highlighting the conflictual nature of the internal emotional landscape.

26:12.920 --> 26:21.920
It's about the fact that there are complex mixed feelings in there towards people who we both love and at times might feel intense rage and want to rip their head off.

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
Right.

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
How does one right.

26:23.920 --> 26:29.920
How does one have that experience inside without thinking there's something wrong with them or you know self attacking or trying yet.

26:29.920 --> 26:41.920
So what this work does is it really highlights on the other side of it highlights for a person that they have complex mixed feelings inside themselves that they have.

26:41.920 --> 26:51.920
They can have two parts sort of you know together at once and then they get then they can choose how to act.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.920
They don't have to act from the rage part you know.

26:54.920 --> 26:59.920
And so the agency comes and this is sort of more wording that came from from Daniel.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.920
But the agency I think comes from noticing.

27:02.920 --> 27:06.920
Oh there is something inside that is complicated.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.920
Now I get to choose how I act.

27:08.920 --> 27:15.920
So that is the distinguishing point as opposed to trying to edit the internal landscape to precisely match how they're acting.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.920
If that makes sense.

27:16.920 --> 27:17.920
It doesn't.

27:17.920 --> 27:27.920
That there is something inside that I can wrestle with and which to make a choice from that allows me to feel I have an ability to make choice as opposed to the other way around.

27:27.920 --> 27:32.920
And I think the problem with pain is that pain is read as oh this is just a thing in my body.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.920
This isn't an emotional experience.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.920
Because there's nothing yet.

27:35.920 --> 27:36.920
Yeah.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.920
But that's the pivot point I'm trying to get at.

27:38.920 --> 27:43.920
Because like one of the one of the one of the things.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.920
Well I from my side I feel like I'm wrestling with.

27:46.920 --> 27:59.920
I mean theoretically is you know the association of emotion with passion where passion means exactly the loss of agency and being overtaken and pain also.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.920
Yeah.

28:00.920 --> 28:01.920
Right.

28:01.920 --> 28:02.920
We suffer pain.

28:02.920 --> 28:03.920
Right.

28:03.920 --> 28:07.920
And I'm just sort of seeing like is there a connection there that right.

28:07.920 --> 28:21.920
There's there like it's like you have when people when people move out of you know the passivity of pain and they get away and they see that emotions can actually right afford their agency.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.920
And see that's what I'm sort of hearing is sorry.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.920
This is just right.

28:26.920 --> 28:27.920
Right.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.920
Does that make does that make sense.

28:30.920 --> 28:35.920
Because like one of the things I bump up against when I try to teach students about.

28:35.920 --> 28:42.920
You know the cognitive importance of emotion is that notion that of no no but emotions are passions.

28:42.920 --> 28:49.920
They we undergo them and they are losses of agency and they overwhelm us and an emotion is a passion.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.920
It's the opposite of an action.

28:51.920 --> 29:00.920
And it sounds to me like what there's a there is this platonic point right where people oh they realize no no no emotion affords agency.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.920
It's not robbing me of choice and agency.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.920
Am I hearing that well.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
Yes.

29:07.920 --> 29:08.920
Yes you are hearing that very well.

29:08.920 --> 29:09.920
Yes.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.920
Yes.

29:10.920 --> 29:17.920
And certainly there are cases where certainly there are cases where the learning around emotion has been one where.

29:17.920 --> 29:22.920
Yeah the impulse the impulse becomes scary because it may overwhelm action and all these sorts of things.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.920
There is that side of this as well.

29:25.920 --> 29:31.920
But but often I think that the move here is that that this damage if we call it that happens so early in life.

29:31.920 --> 29:44.920
It's it's an attachment relationship rupture of some kind which leads to which leads to all these defensive structures coming online which then leads to a lifetime of just having this distance from our emotions.

29:44.920 --> 29:56.920
So the way that we are understanding what an emotional emotional experience might or might not be like is completely removed from the truth of what it could be like because we've already got the defensive structures in place.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.920
And.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.920
And so.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.920
So in terms OK so in terms of pain.

30:05.920 --> 30:11.920
One way of thinking about chronic pain here that relates to this point is that.

30:11.920 --> 30:24.920
Pain the pain that if the pain is being driven if the pain is being driven by an inability for a person to consciously experience the emotion of guilt.

30:24.920 --> 30:30.920
Let's say because a lot of this is just about anger which gets a lot of air time and kind of the space where I am.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.920
But it's about the guilt the child then has about noticing the anger.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.920
That's actually the more the more difficult emotion for a child to bear and for anyone to bear.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.920
It's very difficult emotion very painful painful.

30:44.920 --> 30:55.920
And so rather than learning to experience so rather than having that they experience pain which defends them from the emotional experience of guilt but it also helps to serve the guilt.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.920
It's it's a way of saying I'm a bad person.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.920
I should suffer.

31:00.920 --> 31:06.920
It's actually this is what I mean by the wisdom of emotions once you can get clear with a person that an emotion is not there for no reason.

31:06.920 --> 31:07.920
What's its story.

31:07.920 --> 31:08.920
What's it trying to do.

31:08.920 --> 31:13.920
What's its associated impulse for guilt the impulse is to reach out and repair.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.920
Right.

31:14.920 --> 31:15.920
I want to reach out.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.920
I want and guilt is about a specific action.

31:17.920 --> 31:18.920
It's not the shame.

31:18.920 --> 31:19.920
Right.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.920
Which usually operates as self attack.

31:21.920 --> 31:24.920
It's just another way of turning anger in on oneself.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.920
It's you know it's to reach out and repair.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.920
It's there for a very important biological reason.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.920
It's there to facilitate relationship not to destroy it.

31:32.920 --> 31:33.920
But instead.

31:33.920 --> 31:34.920
Yeah.

31:34.920 --> 31:51.920
So instead for various reasons because people have never had an experience of being able to tolerate internally guilt, anger, grief, emotional pain because it happens so early in life and because it's in the context of an attachment relationship that they are so biologically driven to just hold on to it all costs.

31:51.920 --> 31:52.920
Right.

31:53.920 --> 31:54.920
Yeah.

31:54.920 --> 31:55.920
Yeah.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
As evolutionary provenance.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.920
I mean, you don't have an attachment figure.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.920
You're dead.

31:59.920 --> 32:00.920
You're dead.

32:00.920 --> 32:01.920
Yeah.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.920
Absolutely.

32:02.920 --> 32:03.920
So it makes sense at that time.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.920
But what happens is this model then carries forward for the rest of our lives where it no longer makes sense.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
It's outdated.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.920
But we're not even aware of the model.

32:10.920 --> 32:11.920
We're not even aware of the frame.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.920
It's all unconscious.

32:13.920 --> 32:22.920
So does this does your does your modality talk to attachment theory like or does it talk to EFT things like that as well?

32:22.920 --> 32:25.920
Yeah, it's it's grounded in attachment theory.

32:25.920 --> 32:32.920
So again, I mean, if it becomes relevant, you might explicitly speak to the patient about it, but it's all experiential.

32:32.920 --> 32:33.920
But yes.

32:33.920 --> 32:34.920
So what happens?

32:34.920 --> 32:41.920
So what happens broadly speaking in ISTDP is through first of all, lots of groundwork.

32:41.920 --> 32:48.920
Starting to notice emotions inside the patient starts to notice emotions inside themselves and we can get clear about what those are.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.920
And if we don't pay attention to the pain and we look underneath, what are you feeling?

32:52.920 --> 32:56.920
And so when they're looking underneath the pain, they get clearer on the emotions.

32:56.920 --> 33:09.920
And then we facilitate them having in a full internal emotional experience, which means that they have a full set of sensations in their body, which are quite reliably consistent.

33:09.920 --> 33:14.920
So for example, anger and rage is usually a heat that sort of starts and the belly radiates upwards.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.920
It can go out the hands, the arms.

33:16.920 --> 33:22.920
People feel it all of a sudden once all these resistances are out of the way, they can feel it and experience it in their body.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.920
And then with that, and what would it want to do?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.920
So we're trying to get to the impulse.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.920
What does it want to do?

33:28.920 --> 33:30.920
What does it want you to do this feeling?

33:30.920 --> 33:35.920
And so it's this imaginal walking through of the impulse.

33:35.920 --> 33:46.920
They can get to a point where they can describe in detail what the anger would want to do to their partner who, I don't know, didn't put away the washing yesterday or whatever it was.

33:46.920 --> 33:53.920
And some of this is getting out of the way of rationality because what happens is they step in then to cut it off and say, but that makes no sense.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.920
I shouldn't have raged towards someone for not putting away washing.

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
I can't have that feeling.

33:57.920 --> 34:03.920
So we try and put all that to one side and say, maybe the emotion will show us why it's here and why it's so intense.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.920
So they had the full experience.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.920
They talk through the impulse.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.920
Sometimes the impulse is to the point where the person is dead quite often.

34:15.920 --> 34:22.920
And then through then seeing that, then they can often experience the guilt that's trapped underneath that to see this, you know, imaginal sort of dead figure.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.920
All the feelings come up, the waves of grief.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.920
You know, this is done over a standard period of time for some people.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.920
For some people, you can do it sort of in one big go.

34:31.920 --> 34:32.920
They have all of this.

34:32.920 --> 34:42.920
And then often what happens, John, is that through this, they actually see in that, in that imaginal portrait, they see all of a sudden, oh, it's not my husband.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.920
It's my mother.

34:43.920 --> 34:44.920
It's my father.

34:44.920 --> 34:48.920
Like they see the transfer of the like they see the other person who it relates to.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.920
And then they have a memory come to them spontaneously, right?

34:52.920 --> 34:59.920
And this is some event in their childhood that they have forgotten about or they sort of remember, but haven't really remembered.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.920
And now it just comes to them vividly.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.920
So I'll give you an example.

35:03.920 --> 35:09.920
So, you know, a guy that comes in and say he's presenting complainers that he has crushing pain in his wrists.

35:09.920 --> 35:15.920
And, you know, he sort of had issues with pain all his life and he's had this a bit all his life, but it's become really bad recently.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.920
And he doesn't know why doctors can't help them.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.920
It's so bad that he's he's had a child recently.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.920
He's had a daughter and he can't even hold her.

35:23.920 --> 35:24.920
Right.

35:24.920 --> 35:37.920
And so, you know, through this work, we might come to find that the crushing pain in his wrists is a cover for what has happened as he picks as he becomes a father and starts to pick up his infant daughter.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.920
She starts to reach out and touch his face, right?

35:40.920 --> 35:42.920
And everyone says, oh, how lovely.

35:42.920 --> 35:43.920
This is so wonderful.

35:43.920 --> 35:49.920
Look, you know, and at the same time as crushing pain has come online and he can't pick her up anymore.

35:49.920 --> 36:05.920
So what we what we come to find through this extended sort of form of therapy and doing this imaginal walking through of the emotions is that actually when he was younger, his mother would get in his face and hold him by the chest, right?

36:05.920 --> 36:07.920
And scream at him, right?

36:07.920 --> 36:11.920
Like the baby crying, scream at him and be dysregulated in front of him.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.920
And he was terrified, terribly couldn't move.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.920
And this is his mother.

36:16.920 --> 36:27.920
But when we draw down into it, he had an intense rage towards his mother at that moment, which wanted to reach out, grab her wrists and crush them, crush them so that they would let go.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.920
Right.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.920
But he never experienced that.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.920
He could never tell me that before we met and went through therapy.

36:34.920 --> 36:45.920
And so he comes to realize that, oh, this crushing pain that I feel in my wrists has been activated by my baby daughter reaching out and touching my face, which a part of me has intense rage about.

36:45.920 --> 36:50.920
But I would never notice that because it's my baby daughter and I love her more than anything and I'm supposed to protect her.

36:50.920 --> 36:57.920
So he protects her by feeling crushing pain in his wrists, which is both a rerouting of the impulse, but also works.

36:57.920 --> 36:58.920
This is a relational thing.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.920
Also works to make him unable to pick her up.

37:02.920 --> 37:08.920
So now, even if the impulse ever got out, it can't get out because I'm impotent and I don't even pick her up.

37:08.920 --> 37:16.920
So now he protects her in a second way with a second layer by now he's in a situation where he will never be in the situation where she'll be holding his cheeks.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.920
But he knows none of this consciously at the start.

37:19.920 --> 37:27.920
So there's this whole sort of understanding about how this is working in relationship that is really fundamental here.

37:27.920 --> 37:31.920
And I'm aware that I've probably gone wildly off track to your original question.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
No, no, that was very helpful.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.920
I mean, we can leave the original question aside if we need to.

37:37.920 --> 37:41.920
I thought what you did was actually more to the point.

37:41.920 --> 37:46.920
I do want to give Terri a chance to get involved now.

37:46.920 --> 37:59.920
She's always very gracious and she lets me sort of do this for a bit and open things up and make connections, which I appreciate because often she's introducing me to people.

37:59.920 --> 38:03.920
But I think it's I think it's a good time now to turn things back to Terri.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.920
Thanks, John. Thanks for seeing.

38:05.920 --> 38:09.920
Now, I just really enjoy especially this time enjoying the conversation.

38:09.920 --> 38:25.920
I can certainly see so much of it in the things that we've talked about before and, you know, especially in relation to our thinking of this socialization of pain and how our narrative bias is driving a lot of this.

38:25.920 --> 38:41.920
So, you know, the narrative bias coming from the early childhood experiences and that providing the bias to what we are thinking and giving us a filter of how we are then relating to these things as we go forward in life.

38:41.920 --> 38:51.920
One of the things I wanted to ask you as the chair is about when you are in these moments with someone in therapy, I know you've spoken about being in the flow state with them before.

38:51.920 --> 39:04.920
And I'm really interested about how you enter into the flow state because to me it sounds like you're cultivating an environment, an emotional environment where you're allowing insight to come forward.

39:04.920 --> 39:09.920
And that's again goes to John's point where you're saying like what happens after you leave the session.

39:09.920 --> 39:14.920
Well, now they've got some wisdom that they've gone away with and they carry that with them going forward.

39:14.920 --> 39:25.920
So what it appears to me is that you're cultivating this ability to have emotional insight in the moment and you are creating that experience between you.

39:25.920 --> 39:32.920
So it must be a very special feeling to be in from both sides as the therapist and as the patient.

39:32.920 --> 39:37.920
But what does that bring up for you?

39:37.920 --> 39:49.920
Yeah, there's a, I think this is the word I've used with you before Terry, there's a sort of an embeddedness that that's what it feels like to me when you when I'm really with a patient.

39:49.920 --> 39:57.920
And what facilitates that I think is just really focusing in on the relationship, the one on one relationship.

39:57.920 --> 40:01.920
And obviously, you know, even for the therapist, that can be very confronting too.

40:01.920 --> 40:08.920
So, you know, there's being aware of all your own stuff as well.

40:08.920 --> 40:18.920
So the way I think about it is there's sort of lots of theory and lots of thinking outside of session and then you come to session and I try to just let all that fall away, which is in itself anxiety provoking,

40:18.920 --> 40:21.920
and feel sometimes like I have no idea what I'm doing or where we're going.

40:21.920 --> 40:33.920
But it's just keeping the relationship front and center and the question in my mind really that guides that is how close can I get to this person how close will they let me get to them and how closely can I connect to them.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.920
How vulnerable can we can we be here emotionally.

40:36.920 --> 40:45.920
So the work of that really the groundwork of that is which can take a very long time is trying to to bring down the defensive structures.

40:46.920 --> 40:53.920
So, so getting clear on what are the defenses that are getting in the way of us emotionally connecting, pointing those out.

40:53.920 --> 40:59.920
And then there is often a real battle inside the patient about what they're going to do about that because they've got two parts in operation at once.

40:59.920 --> 41:14.920
So once the part of them, and this is I think fundamental with ISDDP, the idea that there is always a healthy part, we call it that there is always like an unconscious part inside a person that is striving for this emotional liberation.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.920
And this opening up right that is a fundamental tenant of it.

41:18.920 --> 41:25.920
So we so some of this is about trusting that part to help guide us as the clinician.

41:25.920 --> 41:33.920
But that is the part we're trying to get in contact with and trying to try and we are using sort of metaphor and other forms of language to speak to that part as well.

41:34.920 --> 41:43.920
So once once that part rises up against the part that says no way we never we never let someone get that close to us, especially not another woman.

41:43.920 --> 41:47.920
You know, like last time I did that it was disastrous women never get that close to me.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.920
This part is going to try very once this part can finally break free.

41:51.920 --> 41:58.920
That is when the defenses go down and that is when the person has more ready access to their emotions and they just become spontaneous with it.

41:58.920 --> 42:03.920
There's no more resistance. That is when this flow state I would say is occurring.

42:03.920 --> 42:09.920
It's when you can see it, you get the sense in their eyes almost.

42:09.920 --> 42:13.920
And so but it calls for me to also connect in the same way.

42:13.920 --> 42:17.920
So I need to get to my emotional landscape and that can be fronting too.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.920
But everything else falls away.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.920
Like there are I mean, it's not just me.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.920
I mean other therapists who have been using this model far longer than me.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.920
You know, talk about the ways in which even their perception changes.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.920
They, you know, the way that they see color might change.

42:33.920 --> 42:38.920
They might, you know, there's a there's a change to to the state of mind.

42:38.920 --> 42:42.920
There's just a change in in the moment.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.920
It feels very different and you're just with the person.

42:44.920 --> 42:54.920
And when I when I am like that, which is not, you know, not all the time, probably very infrequent to be honest, but at its best things come to me as well.

42:54.920 --> 43:01.920
Like I find myself sort of, you know, saying things and they just somehow are the right thing to say that it's helping to bring up whatever needs to come up.

43:01.920 --> 43:08.920
So there is a letting go and a trusting of an unconscious component here, which is part of the model.

43:08.920 --> 43:14.920
And that relates directly, though, to the way that the emotion is understood as actually being kind of this.

43:14.920 --> 43:20.920
It walks between the unconscious and conscious, I guess answers your question.

43:20.920 --> 43:28.920
No, no, it's really interesting. So as you know, in the work that I did with the practice, two different practitioners were together.

43:28.920 --> 43:35.920
Many of the practitioners talked about it being transformational for them to actually be part of that environment.

43:35.920 --> 43:49.920
And I think you've spoken a lot to that, even though you're the practitioner on your own in that session, which is probably taking on all the burden, because I know that you're a very holistic practitioner and you're looking at the whole senses of the person in that room at that time.

43:49.920 --> 43:56.920
Can you just a little bit more about the language? You mentioned metaphor and thing that you bring to the table.

43:56.920 --> 44:08.920
But one of the things we've been talking about with John is about how the practitioners also need to have a common language that they can use that we can get to this point with people.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.920
So we can help them to understand what's going on.

44:11.920 --> 44:17.920
Part of the problem is that we don't have a common language between practitioners and people who need the help.

44:17.920 --> 44:25.920
So how are you working with that? I know you sort of said and alluded to the types of people that are coming to you.

44:25.920 --> 44:30.920
I'm assuming they're all coming to you a free choice as well. So that's a thing.

44:30.920 --> 44:42.920
But yeah, obviously you've probably done quite a lot of work on this in the past to actually decide what kind of language you'll use and how that works for you.

44:42.920 --> 44:51.920
That's a really, really important point. I mean, I think even the word unconscious is really off-putting for many people.

44:51.920 --> 44:57.920
So, you know, I think using something like hidden or trapped or can be useful.

44:57.920 --> 45:07.920
So just talking about the idea that, you know, it's quite common when it comes to depression or anxiety or chronic pain of the nature that you're describing,

45:08.920 --> 45:15.920
that it is a signal. It's a signal that our brain is giving us to protect us from something else that's happening under the surface.

45:15.920 --> 45:23.920
And, you know, the idea that, you know, under the surface there may be hidden elements or sort of trapped elements under there.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.920
And usually these are emotional in nature.

45:26.920 --> 45:30.920
So that would be the way that I probably talk about it.

45:30.920 --> 45:39.920
And if we can get to that sort of the engine, if that's the thing that's driving the need for these other symptoms to be here,

45:39.920 --> 45:44.920
because they're firing to try and keep us distant from what's happening under the surface,

45:44.920 --> 45:53.920
then if we can maybe bring this up and out and look at it, you know, you and I together over time very carefully at a rate that you're comfortable with,

45:53.920 --> 46:00.920
you can just see what's there and see if we can put all our assumptions aside and try and make, you know, have a look at what it shows us.

46:00.920 --> 46:10.920
That might help your brain to see that it doesn't need to be doing all this on the top anymore and this actually can fall away.

46:10.920 --> 46:19.920
So the anxiety and the depressive symptoms and the chronic pain that you're experiencing may no longer be needed because you've brought this scary thing,

46:19.920 --> 46:22.920
the thing that your brain has decided is very scary and you should never look at it.

46:22.920 --> 46:31.920
You've brought it up and out into the light and hopefully in doing that we might see that not only is it okay, not so scary,

46:31.920 --> 46:37.920
but also that it might tell you something really important that helps to clear up your vision.

46:37.920 --> 46:43.920
It helps you to understand yourself and how you are in relationships so much more clearly.

46:43.920 --> 46:50.920
And that is usually the link for people, Terri, that's really helpful because people often present with, I don't have confidence, you know,

46:50.920 --> 46:56.920
I'm paralyzed at making a decision, lots of self-doubt, you know, I want to feel confident.

46:56.920 --> 47:04.920
Well, the confidence comes from this agency piece we were talking about that actually access to these things that are trapped under here

47:04.920 --> 47:11.920
might be the thing that gives you more information that allows you to see more clearly and therefore it feels easier for you to make decisions.

47:11.920 --> 47:18.920
It seems clearer to you about your desire and your preference and that you can act in the world with that.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.920
Is that what you meant by language?

47:20.920 --> 47:27.920
Yes, yes, because I've certainly found in all the stories and the people I've spoken to when it comes to persistent pain,

47:27.920 --> 47:33.920
so, you know, pain of different, so emotional and physical pain continuing for a long time,

47:33.920 --> 47:39.920
then quite often it's been a case of there being guilt and shame sitting underneath that.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.920
But that's the last thing people want to talk about.

47:42.920 --> 47:51.920
It's very, very difficult to get to that place of being in that vulnerable position to actually talk, because we just don't have,

47:51.920 --> 48:00.920
we don't have a natural place to start from to talk about things like, like I said, anger is something that we do know how to talk about

48:00.920 --> 48:02.920
because we talk about the actions of anger.

48:03.920 --> 48:08.920
We don't really have a way of talking about guilt and shame in the same way,

48:08.920 --> 48:13.920
but we have an awful lot of narrative bias that are held by guilt and shame,

48:13.920 --> 48:18.920
that, yeah, we just don't find a way to talk about it in the same way.

48:18.920 --> 48:25.920
What are the actions? What are the things? How is it feeling in us when we have these emotions?

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
Yes.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.920
Could I say something?

48:28.920 --> 48:31.920
I just want to pick up on the language theme if that's okay.

48:31.920 --> 48:32.920
Is that all right?

48:32.920 --> 48:41.920
Because I want to take it a little bit further, because I want to talk about not only language in therapy, but between therapies

48:41.920 --> 48:48.920
and what I mean by that, and because this is also an aspect that I heard in Terry's question.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.920
Maybe that's not what her intent was, but I was.

48:50.920 --> 49:01.920
So for example, let's have somebody who's coming to you because there's good reason to believe that the issues that you describe are taking place in them.

49:01.920 --> 49:09.920
But they also actually literally have like some damage, muscular damage, and they're needing to do physio and things like that.

49:09.920 --> 49:19.920
And what's interesting is some of the language you were using around the imaginal and the, you know, how things are metaphorical and embedded.

49:19.920 --> 49:27.920
I mean, if you take a look at Nick Winkleman's work on the language of coaching, and he talks about you have to give people an active metaphor

49:27.920 --> 49:30.920
so they inhabit their body in different ways.

49:30.920 --> 49:38.920
And they learn through these imaginal practices how to move in a different way, and that feeds back into a different sense of agency.

49:38.920 --> 49:47.920
And part of what I heard in Terry's question, and I'm not attributing anything to Terry, but Terry and I do talk about this is like,

49:47.920 --> 49:53.920
but what kind of language could we use that would help you and the physiotherapists?

49:53.920 --> 50:03.920
It's not instead of talking past each other or politely disliking each other or the kind of thing that might happen because that you come from very different worlds.

50:03.920 --> 50:10.920
You're talking about an inner world and the unconscious, and presumably they're coming from a very physiological, mechanically oriented world.

50:10.920 --> 50:16.920
And if we just use those two languages, you're not going to talk to each other and the patient's going to then, right?

50:16.920 --> 50:23.920
But if we say, well, wait, wait, wait, there's this imaginal, there's an active metaphor, there's the way the body can symbolize things,

50:23.920 --> 50:34.920
and there's a way we can get that to open up and between us, and you use language from, you know, you used one of the four E's, it's embedded, and it's dynamical.

50:34.920 --> 50:43.920
I'm interested in that, I'm interested in, so this is not language you'd be using maybe right in therapy,

50:43.920 --> 50:50.920
although you might use it in front of the patient when you and another therapist are talking together.

50:50.920 --> 50:56.920
And Terry, does that land for you as also a dimension of the language issue?

50:56.920 --> 51:05.920
Yes, yes, definitely. I wondered if maybe we extend that as Bezier, have you had experience working with another practitioner in the room?

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:06.920 --> 51:11.920
That would be really interesting how you reflect on language that you use.

51:11.920 --> 51:22.920
Not with ISTDP. I have worked with other clinicians before, definitely using other forms of therapy, and probably more helpfully.

51:22.920 --> 51:33.920
I mean, I've worked on lots of research projects that look at team practice and look at sort of innovative ways to respond to clinical complexity,

51:33.920 --> 51:39.920
and some of that has exposed me to some of these ideas and thinking about how this might work in practice.

51:40.920 --> 51:54.920
If I had another, so if I had someone like a physio in the room, and we're trying to work together, I think this does relate to how I might talk to a patient anyway, to be fair.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.920
Okay, I didn't want to pin you down though.

51:56.920 --> 51:57.920
No, that's okay.

51:58.920 --> 52:05.920
It's not, it's not choosing one over the other. Both are true. It's really, you know, both are true.

52:05.920 --> 52:14.920
There is a component here that is that working on the physical body is likely to give you some kind of relief.

52:14.920 --> 52:15.920
Yes.

52:15.920 --> 52:19.920
And there is, you know, that working on the emotional, I just call it the emotional landscape.

52:19.920 --> 52:26.920
I don't even use any of this psychological or just working on your emotional landscape will provide some relief.

52:26.920 --> 52:30.920
And wouldn't it be amazing if both things could happen at tandem so you could have maximum relief?

52:30.920 --> 52:39.920
Like if the idea is that this is a cycle and one is informing the other, you know, they are ultimately, you can't separate them.

52:40.920 --> 52:49.920
And so if we can both be, you know, working on one part of it, then hopefully together that provides maximum relief.

52:49.920 --> 52:55.920
I don't see it as a choice between one or the other. Both are true.

52:55.920 --> 52:58.920
Both are just different ways of looking at the same thing.

52:58.920 --> 53:02.920
And I don't think that, I mean, this gets a bit more broad, I guess.

53:02.920 --> 53:11.920
But my thinking is I don't think that there is one ideal way that any human being could address the entirety of something.

53:11.920 --> 53:15.920
I just think we have limited view by nature of who we are.

53:15.920 --> 53:22.920
And so we can work on that and how wonderful to have multiple people working from different viewpoints together.

53:22.920 --> 53:31.920
So I would just talk about it as, you know, let's consider the idea that emotions are having a role here

53:31.920 --> 53:34.920
and they're having a very real impact on the body.

53:34.920 --> 53:41.920
And so I don't know anything about, you know, what might be relieving to the muscles and whatever that you do.

53:41.920 --> 53:49.920
And I might have some role here in being able to speak to why it is that this is even happening in the first place.

53:49.920 --> 53:56.920
You know, that doesn't mean that the physical correlates aren't there and that working on them can have some relief.

53:56.920 --> 54:06.920
But if there's an engine underneath driving that, that's about self-punishment, for example, then fixing this is just going to lead to that engine

54:06.920 --> 54:09.920
manifesting somewhere else in this person's life.

54:09.920 --> 54:17.920
But just to take it further, I mean, you could, given the example you had with the wrist and being held, you could, you know,

54:17.920 --> 54:24.920
the therapist could present the movement that's needed to do the damage and connect it to that metaphor and say,

54:24.920 --> 54:30.920
when you're doing this to, but think about that, think about, like, getting release and being free from that.

54:30.920 --> 54:33.920
Or, you know, to see what it is.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.920
Yeah, yeah.

54:35.920 --> 54:41.920
But by giving them a bridging metaphor that bridges between the two therapies in an important way.

54:41.920 --> 54:45.920
Yes.

54:45.920 --> 54:49.920
Yeah.

54:49.920 --> 54:55.920
See, these are the questions Terry and I are really, I mean, we're interested in everything you're saying.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.920
But I'm also, we're interested in this.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.920
We're interested in what could we do.

54:59.920 --> 55:03.920
I mean, you're coming at this very wholeheartedly and that's very appreciative.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.920
But, you know, some people will come in more hesitantly.

55:06.920 --> 55:12.920
And if we could say, right, you know, well, there's a way in which you, you two could co-create a shared language.

55:12.920 --> 55:19.920
And if we play around like we're doing right here, we might start to uncover some shared language that we could both use.

55:19.920 --> 55:25.920
And we could get the two therapies to work in concert rather than orthogonal to each other.

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
Yeah, no, I love that.

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
I like the language.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.920
I like the language of opening up.

55:29.920 --> 55:35.920
So I think as opposed to release, I have among the on the fence about the word release.

55:35.920 --> 55:38.920
I think that actually freaks some people out and that's part of the problem.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.920
They think the impulse is going to be released out of them.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.920
That's why they, that's part of the defense, why the structure is there.

55:43.920 --> 55:45.920
But that would be, that's exactly it.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.920
You could say to the physiotherapist, say, don't use release language.

55:48.920 --> 55:49.920
That's the wrong metaphor.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.920
Try to use opening up language.

55:52.920 --> 55:55.920
Creating more space inside.

55:55.920 --> 55:56.920
And you can still do that.

55:56.920 --> 55:57.920
You do that with your physical body.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.920
Like I think about, you know, I used acceptance and commitment therapy for a long time.

56:01.920 --> 56:06.920
And the way that you would deal with difficult emotions there is to imagine more space inside around the emotion.

56:06.920 --> 56:07.920
Right.

56:07.920 --> 56:09.920
It's an open up, but it's still inside you.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.920
It's not about, I need to throw it out into the world because I can't have it.

56:12.920 --> 56:18.920
Because it's important that it's, you see it in reality as being part of the inner landscape.

56:18.920 --> 56:23.920
It doesn't need to go into relationship or it doesn't, doesn't need to be enacted the impulse.

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
So, so opening up is nice.

56:24.920 --> 56:30.920
So you could talk about while they're doing the exercises, you know, can you feel how that, how that is opening you up?

56:30.920 --> 56:33.920
Can you feel how that is opening up the emotion?

56:33.920 --> 56:41.920
You know, it might also be opening you up to be able to see and recognize this anger and more and more detail as you do these exercises.

56:41.920 --> 56:44.920
I would talk about opening up as opposed to release.

56:44.920 --> 56:50.920
It's teaching the person that they can, that they have space and room inside to bear an emotion in a sort of graded way.

56:50.920 --> 56:52.920
But also opening up as metaphorical.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.920
Opening up means so many things.

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

56:55.920 --> 56:56.920
That's it.

56:56.920 --> 57:01.920
That possibility opening up, you know, a relationship of your life, your movement in the world and your action.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.920
So I think opening up is how I talk.

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
That's how I talk about it.

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
Yeah.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.920
I just, I just say that release is a very negative thing.

57:08.920 --> 57:14.920
So we release our anger and it's like quite often the thing we're trying to stop and hold back from.

57:14.920 --> 57:17.920
So that if you say you're trying to, you know, you're going to release something.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.920
It's like, maybe I need to hold that back, not do it.

57:20.920 --> 57:22.920
You know, so it's kind of.

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
Yeah.

57:23.920 --> 57:24.920
If it's an aggressive, yeah.

57:24.920 --> 57:25.920
Yeah.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.920
If you're talking about the aggressive impulse that comes with it.

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
Yes.

57:28.920 --> 57:33.920
But there is, there is a way to that with this work, you come to see that anger can be really useful, helps people to be assertive.

57:33.920 --> 57:36.920
The people that are passive and never take action.

57:36.920 --> 57:37.920
You can integrate the anger.

57:37.920 --> 57:42.920
And so now anger makes me realize I don't like what this person's doing, but I also love them.

57:42.920 --> 57:44.920
How can I tell them in a loving way?

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
Really don't like what you're doing.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
It's, it's hurting me.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.920
It's impacting the relationship.

57:48.920 --> 57:52.920
Oh, that can help us to connect more and actually make our relationship better.

57:52.920 --> 57:56.920
Anger can help me if I bring it in in the right way to make the relationship better.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.920
So, um, so, but you're right.

57:58.920 --> 58:03.920
This, this idea that I think people can fight anger with aggressive impulse.

58:03.920 --> 58:07.920
And so the idea that you're releasing exactly right, that would people would not want to.

58:07.920 --> 58:13.920
Or it also insinuates that anger is like a poison that should never, you should never have and you need to release it.

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
That's.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.920
And there's other, there's other potential connections.

58:16.920 --> 58:21.920
You talked a lot about sort of seeing in a new way and even inhabiting your body in a new way.

58:21.920 --> 58:27.920
And a lot of reason why people are like, they have trouble in physio is because of exactly that.

58:27.920 --> 58:30.920
They're not inhabiting their body in the right way.

58:30.920 --> 58:35.920
And if you could get people to say, Oh, like in both these places, I'm not inhabiting my body in the right way.

58:35.920 --> 58:37.920
And you could get those to talk to each other.

58:37.920 --> 58:42.920
You see, this is what, this is what I'm trying to get at this, this kind of right.

58:42.920 --> 58:47.920
And what Terry's got some research showing that if the patient is watching you and the other therapists,

58:47.920 --> 58:52.920
like co-create this language, especially in a way that's accessible to them,

58:52.920 --> 58:56.920
that has extra, that has extra therapeutic benefit to it.

58:56.920 --> 58:58.920
Well, they're watching integration happen.

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
So that's right.

58:59.920 --> 59:00.920
Yeah.

59:00.920 --> 59:01.920
Yeah.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.920
They are witnessing their inter-psychic play out.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
That's great.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.920
Yeah, I don't need to say it anymore.

59:07.920 --> 59:09.920
Look, look, others are saying it too.

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
Yes, yes.

59:10.920 --> 59:14.920
So therapy, John, we are trying to help facilitate them seeing that inside themselves.

59:14.920 --> 59:17.920
So a step two, that might be to see it in front of them.

59:17.920 --> 59:21.920
Oh, and these are also two people who, you know, hopefully know what they're talking about.

59:21.920 --> 59:25.920
So I can't just look away and minimize and rationalize out of this.

59:25.920 --> 59:32.920
And they happen and that, again, you know, even on unconscious level may start to help them to notice it inside themselves

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
and start to integrate inside themselves.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.920
Modeling goes deeper in the brain than propositions.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.920
Really, it really does.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.920
And this also speaks to group therapy.

59:41.920 --> 59:47.920
Like I've been thinking Terry too about, because I know you're thinking about sort of how are you going to take this and how can it be useful?

59:47.920 --> 59:52.920
You know, there's a lot of these pain protocols that are being used are done in a group setting.

59:52.920 --> 01:00:00.920
And I think it's a similar thing, you know, that being able to witness other people around you have their own wrestling match of this.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:11.920
And for some people, helps to see that more clearly within themselves and maybe helps them to then be able to do that more clearly for themselves.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Right, but it's a need to see it externally.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.920
Yes, I think hearing other people's stories is amazingly therapeutic.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:27.920
It allows you to go see something in it that allows you to then to open up yourself and say, I'm not that unusual.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.920
There is something, I have a connection with someone on something and I can actually say that loud.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.920
And that actually helps you to actually then, you know, consider it yourself.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Absolutely Terry.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:43.920
And I think for, you know, for people who are open in a particular way, that's true.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:51.920
I think there are also people who are highly motivated to avoid some part of themselves to any degree and to hear a story that should otherwise do that.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.920
For them, they'll find all sorts of ways to discount that story and dismiss it.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
This is part of what happens.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:03.920
The highly resistant patient is the one that, you know, something like ISTDP is really important for.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Whereas these sort of simpler forms that make up a pain protocol are going to be useful for another subset of people.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
The shared language.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.920
Yeah, the opening up the, yes, the inhabiting your body.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:25.920
So it's true that for many people that intellectualize and isolate emotional experiences being something that's like a word that pops up in my brain.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.920
They have no connection to what it feels like in their body.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.920
And so that is the work.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:36.920
The work is getting back into the body and they start to notice all these sensations in their body that they've never noticed before.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:45.920
I taught Tai Chi Chuan for a couple of decades and getting people to inhabit their body is a very difficult thing to do.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:57.920
And then people will often, if this is a big move for them, they'll often be the release of emotion associated with that, re-enhabiting their body.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:01.920
That's why they don't want to be in their body because it helps them to avoid the emotions.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.920
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.920
I mean, I would love to think about that shared language thing in some more depth.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.920
Because that is, yeah, that is the practical takeaway here, isn't it?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.920
That would be useful to what?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.920
Well, at least one.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.920
I mean, there's lots of practical people, but that's one, yeah, I would say.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.920
I think it's just something that we are collectively discussing.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:42.920
I think even just the action of discussing the need for a shared language is something that's, you know, really helping us go forward because it's a little bit more comes out each time we have these conversations, I think.

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:50.920
And I also think like the process of co-creating it in front of patient is valuable.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.920
So I've been trying to do a thing where instead of like, this is in the scientific domain, but I think there's some analogy.

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:05.920
Instead of just presenting the pristine final project, I've tried to do things where I'm working with other people collaboratively and they're seeing the scientific process.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.920
They're not just seeing the finished product.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:14.920
And they take a much more participatory role in that because they get involved with the generation of it.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.920
And they're not just pointing at the finished product.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.920
They're actually embodying it, right?

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.920
They're almost imitating it.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.920
Sounds like voice craft as well.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:29.920
That's been actually being part of these sorts of conversations.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
Yeah.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.920
No, absolutely, absolutely.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:42.920
I think to, I mean, I don't know if this will be useful or not, but in terms of that, the clinicians sort of talking together and what they're doing and what they're modeling.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:52.920
If they, I mean, part of this work is getting comfortable with our own emotional landscape and actually being forthcoming about that sometimes at key junctures.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:04:02.920
And I just don't know, it might be useful for them to at least be bringing some of that language in when they're talking in front of the patient about how they're feeling, you know, how they're feeling during this process.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:12.920
Just to normalize it for one, I mean, I'd have to think more on exactly how, you know, that might be utilized.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:21.920
But it would be strange if they were doing this in front of the patient with the goal of trying to model something and not be reflecting it all on their emotional experience, wouldn't it?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920
And just be up here.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:38.920
Well, hopefully, like I say, if they were involved in the process and not into the usual cultural drama of presenting the pristine product, that might make them more open to, like, you know, a participatory relationship to it rather than I am.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:47.920
Even to say, even to say to one another as they're doing it in front of the patient, you know, wow, as you point that out, I hadn't thought about that before and I feel anxious as a result, you know.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.920
Yeah, for sure, you should on the table.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:58.920
And, you know, but, you know, this is something we should look at and like to really do the wrestling with something in front of the patient as opposed to avoiding.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920
Yeah.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920
I agree.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.920
I mean, that's what I meant by modeling, right?

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.920
They're going to be modeling yet, right, to the patient and not just.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:16.920
And it's about, and it's about, it's also, you know, it models to the patient the idea of participating and trying rather, you know, because what we're often also held back in certain ways.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Because we, we carry around these, these, you know, sort of all or nothing mentalities.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.920
You either succeed or you're a failure.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.920
And that also impedes a lot of this kind of work we're trying to do with people.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.920
At least I find that with some of my students.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.920
They get, they get into this thing where they get very self-defeating, because if they can't give the perfect essay, then there's no point.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.920
And I'm trying to say, the word essay actually means to try, right?

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.920
Like you're supposed to be trying here.

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
Right.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.920
Right.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.920
That probably had very punitive authority figures in their past.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920
Right.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920
Very much not.

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.920
And I, and ongoing.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.920
It's, it's, yeah, there's very much, there's very much.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920
Yeah.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:59.920
If I.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:05.920
With an authority figure, the idea that you could express to them your anger or just pleasure or something that they're doing doesn't come into the equation.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:16.920
And so just noticing that you might feel some dislike or anger or irritation towards the person who's asking you to write this essay and asking you to put yourself out on the chopping block for, you know, being marked and evaluated.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.920
Natural to feel some anger towards that person.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.920
But they probably don't even realize that they just noticed their self attack.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920
It gets turned inwards.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920
Now I give myself.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:34.920
And it gets very twisted because that you can also find out indirectly that the parent is helping by trying to manage this problem.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
Right.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920
And coming in and right.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.920
And we can fix this.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:42.920
And it's like, well, maybe that's not what you should be doing here.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920
Yeah.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.920
Yeah.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.920
Yeah.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:46.920
Yeah.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.920
Yeah.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:59.920
And then you widen that out just to the local community around them and then to the wider experience that they're having with all the other, you know, metacrisis and things that we've got going on.

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:03.920
Then that is just all coming down on them at the same time.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:04.920
Oh, yeah.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.920
Yeah.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Yeah.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920
You know,

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920
It's a prime example.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920
Oh, yeah.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:10.920
It's already high as fever.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920
Right.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920
The bar is already so high.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.920
Most of them have got there through their own perfectionistic tendencies and self punitive tendencies already.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:21.920
And it's just, it's just, and, you know, what they have to do is continually be assessed.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:22.920
Yeah.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.920
And they're on Instagram seeing perfect lives that are.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.920
And they know propositionally they're fraudulent, but that doesn't matter to other parts of the brain, right?

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:33.920
No.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:34.920
No.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.920
And then it has huge, it has huge effects on them.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920
Mm-hmm.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920
Anyways.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.920
We'll talk a little about the presentation.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
Yeah.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
Yeah.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920
Yeah.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920
Yeah.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.920
We're coming to the end of our time and I want to thank you.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.920
I mean, that was just really, really.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.920
Well, I think we modeled to some degree we were talking about it became very collaborative.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.920
And of course, Terry, it's always wonderful to have you here.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:11.920
I'll give you two ladies a brief minute or two to do any summative or cumulative or provocative final words that you want to leave people with.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.920
Maybe, Terry, you first and then you, Appassia.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920
Yeah.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.920
Well, I just really appreciate the conversation.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.920
I think we've opened up a lot of avenues that still need a lot of exploration.

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.920
So I'm looking forward to those.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:38.920
I think I'm really interested to talk further about this moment of the action impulse and when that happens because the work we've been doing is really about this one turning point.

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.920
And I think that we touched on it and I really want to go.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.920
I think it might even need a whole nother session to go into this.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.920
What happens at this one particular moment?

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.920
I'm really keen to continue that discussion.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.920
But thank you both so much for this.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920
It's been great.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920
Thank you both.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:55.920
Thank you both.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:04.920
That really speaks this point that you're bringing up at the end, Terry, about the things most interested in following on about the impulse really speaks to the unconscious alliance.

01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:11.920
I think that's alive here with us because that by chance happens to be the area that I am most most fascinated by right now.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.920
And I'm actually yes, looking at that in all sorts of ways.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.920
I agree with you.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:24.920
I think that that is a pivotal a pivotal point in all of this and something that ISTDP has brought into the mix for me that I never.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:29.920
I never had with any other form of therapy that I'm trained and I trained in lots of models.

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:40.920
And that is the part of the part of the ingredient list that is making this form of therapy so much more transformative in the work that I do anyway.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:51.920
It's giving me access to do things in the room and for people to change in ways that I've never seen before in other forms of therapy that I've used.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:58.920
And I see some of that I think is being, to me, the action impulse is sort of liminal.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.920
It's like the point between the internal and the external.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.920
It's the bit right before it comes out of us and becomes action.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.920
And I think there's something really important about that.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.920
So yes, this has been this has just been such a pleasure and a delight.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:19.920
And I feel I feel that I've only really just scratched the surface of so many of the areas that I would love to to dive in.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.920
I hope it's been useful to have a tendency to go in 30 different directions.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.920
No, it was very great.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.920
It's been great.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920
It's been wonderful.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:29.920
Thank you.

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.920
Thank you so very much.
