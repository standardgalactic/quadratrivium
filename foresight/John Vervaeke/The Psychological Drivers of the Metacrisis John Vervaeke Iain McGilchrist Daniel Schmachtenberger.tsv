0	12000	Welcome everyone. This past September, September 2023, I had the great pleasure of sitting down in Oxford with Ian McGilchrist and Daniel Schmacktenberger, and we recorded this video.
12000	35000	It's an intense and deep and exciting discussion in which we use our collective attention and whatever collective wisdom we were able to muster to try and address the question of the metacrisis that's facing us.
35000	48000	This video has shown up on Daniel's channel and on Ian's channel, but I thought my audience should also have direct and specific access to it.
48000	62000	It's a long video, but we're getting tremendous amount of positive feedback on how it's worth the time put into it. So I'm going to thank you ahead of time for your time and attention.
62000	75000	So we are here today to discuss, I believe the title of this will be called something like the Psychological Drivers of the Metacrisis and what possible responses might look like.
75000	94000	And so I'll start briefly with what do we mean by metacrisis and then ask you to share some of the short version of the models that you have shared at great depth in your writing and your work, and ask you to also share
94000	105000	your opening frame so that people who aren't already familiar with your work can come along, though everybody should, if they're interested in this, go deeper. There's a lot of resources to go deeper.
105000	120000	I'm also not assuming, since we all just know each other a tiny bit, enough to have a sense of shared interest, but not enough that we've already done this. This is extemporaneous, which is part of what makes it very interesting to me.
120000	140000	So I'm not assuming that either of you share the exact same assessment of the metacrisis. That's not implicit in you being here, but I know from our conversations you both share a sense that the state of the world has problems and impending risks that are serious,
140000	155000	that are not automatically resolving themselves, that are novel in history. So we can just say the challenging state of the world, what in the nature of human mind, the nature of human conditioning experience,
155000	176000	we might even find that the term psychology or cognitive drivers are insufficient, which is fine, has brought us here, and what might a different relationship to human mind, psychology, cognition look like that might allow a more viable, better future.
176000	190000	So just briefly on the metacrisis frame, before World War Two there was no risk that we could very quickly destroy the entire habitability of human civilization.
190000	206000	That was brought into being with very powerful technology, nuclear weapons, and for the first time ever we had the ability to make a series of bad decisions and radically change the possibility space of the world.
207000	225000	Before the Industrial Revolution we didn't really have the capability of destroying the biosphere at scale, that's not as fast, that takes a few hundred years, but we're at the place where the planetary boundaries in terms of species extinction, in terms of chemical pollution, in terms of many planetary boundaries are being crossed.
225000	243000	The Stockholm Resilience Center published its update to the planetary boundaries framework just a few days ago that showed of the nine major boundaries they've identified we've radically crossed six already, which means who knows if we were to change the direction already what would happen.
243000	260000	And that was the result of the Industrial Revolution and the technology that it made possible, moving us from half a billion people before the Industrial Revolution to eight billion people, and increasing the resource consumption per capita by about a hundred X in the industrialized world.
260000	268000	So sixteen times the population, a hundred times the resource consumption per population, obviously without advanced tech we couldn't do that.
268000	292000	So there's something about the crises that we're facing and then obviously AI and synthetic biology and drones and cyber weapons and the radically complicated six continent supply chain that is all very novel human technological development that wasn't true in any previous age.
293000	305000	Without human technology there is no global existential risk that is human induced. There might be a meteor or something, but not anthropogenic catastrophic risk. So we're in a unique position in time.
305000	317000	The poly crisis is a frame that a lot of people have heard that says rather than just focus on climate change or just coral or just species extinction or just nuclear we have to focus on all these issues.
317000	326000	And we have to recognize that they can inter-effect each other, that one of these issues getting worse can cascade into other ones and that sometimes the solution to one can make other ones worse.
326000	343000	So the answer in World War Two to how do we not have nuclear war was mutually assured destruction and the Bretton Woods Global Financial System and a whole bunch of like the whole post-war order, which did mean we didn't have nuclear war between superpowers.
343000	353000	But it was also part of what led to the six continent supply chain and exponential growth connected to a linear materials economy that have pushed us to the planetary boundaries.
353000	357000	And so we can see solutions to some problems can end up leading to other ones.
357000	371000	The metacrisis frame, the slight distinction from that terminology from the poly crisis is that we're not just looking at the mini crises and how they can cascade, but that there are underlying dynamics that give rise to them.
372000	376000	Obviously humans are animals, we're part of nature.
376000	392000	We're also pretty obviously unique when you fly into London or into New York or whatever and you look at the world you see the Anthropocene in a way that the next most environment modifying creatures are things like beavers.
392000	397000	This is obviously a radically different scale of environment modification.
397000	408000	And so there's something about human technology that arises from something about human mind, both our capacity to create it and then also how we utilize it.
408000	412000	So some people look at the origin of the metacrisis starting with stone tools.
412000	420000	Some look at it starting with the agricultural revolution and the plow or the industrial revolution or various places that I think they're all interesting.
420000	437000	But if we simply say we have a bunch of risks to civilization's ability to continue, to continue well, that are real worth considering and different than they were historically.
437000	442000	It's also worth stating that most early civilizations don't still exist.
442000	451000	There is no more Egyptian or Ottoman or Byzantine or Mayan empire, and the collapse of those civilizations has been academically studied, but they weren't global civilizations.
451000	464000	So there is some precedent that civilizations have a life cycle. We have the first six continent global civilization, meaning the tech that is recording this can't be made in any country in the world.
464000	471000	The internet that is broadcasting this to people requires this global civilization to produce.
471000	478000	So metacrisis. I think everyone is aware of there's a lot of risks that we face.
478000	486000	And we can look at the economic drivers in terms of perverse incentives and externalised costs.
486000	493000	We can look at the game theoretic rival risk drivers in terms of arms races and tragedy of the commons.
493000	499000	We can look at the theory of technology, the way that technology itself ends up shaping mind.
499000	508000	We can obviously look at things deep in the nature of human psychology, our value systems, our cognition.
508000	517000	It's pretty clear when we look around that none of the other animals or plants are causing possible self-induced extinction of planetary systems.
517000	522000	There's no planetary boundaries as a result of the activity of deer or algae or oak trees.
522000	528000	So there's something unique about humans. Is this innate to human nature and there's no way of escaping it?
528000	533000	Is this something that human nature can do but is not the only thing it can do?
533000	540000	It can be conditioned, it could be conditioned differently. This is what we're here to explore today.
540000	549000	Ian, obviously your book The Master and his Emissary kind of answers this question in a way,
549000	559000	which is, though it's coming from a different angle, getting the master and emissary wrong would be said to be the cause of all the crises that we face, the situation we're in.
559000	568000	For those who don't already have that framework, do you want to share your introductory thoughts on the human condition that has brought us here?
568000	583000	Yes, I agree with you wholeheartedly that we need to look for underlying causes of a whole pattern of events that are not just unfortunate things that happen to happen.
583000	590000	We were doing very well and then suddenly people said the climate was changing and the seas were polluted and so forth.
590000	601000	There's a whole range of events that can be traced back to the inevitable consequence of a certain way of looking at the world.
601000	617000	And that way of looking at the world is, in my view, associated with and driven by a model of the world that is present to the left hemisphere in a way that is not the case with the right hemisphere.
617000	626000	In brief, the right hemisphere seems to be more in touch with presence, with what actually experience comes to us and what we inhabit.
626000	638000	Whereas the left hemisphere is providing a representation, no longer the presence, but a map, a program, a theory, a diagram,
638000	648000	but something abstracted, categorical, removed from and not having the characteristics of the world that it is intending to map.
648000	663000	Now, I mean, I should say that to anybody who doesn't know my work, you've probably heard that everything to do with hemispheres is wrong and that it's outmoded and science has got past it.
663000	670000	This is not true. If you don't know my work, then forget almost everything you think you know about hemisphere differences.
670000	673000	They're not the ones that you were told.
673000	680000	But there are, although we got the differences largely wrong, not entirely wrong, but mainly wrong.
680000	686000	That doesn't mean to say that there are no differences and it wouldn't be important to find out what those differences are.
686000	688000	That's something I've researched for about 30 years.
689000	704000	And in short, the difference comes down to ultimately a mode of attention, which is an evolutionary development that goes back pretty much as far as we can trace it.
704000	708000	We think back to trilobites and possibly even beyond.
708000	720000	So this is something in which there needs to be two ways of attending to the world that are both very important but appear to be mutually incompatible.
720000	725000	One is that with which we grasp things. We need to get things in order to survive.
725000	731000	We need to get food. We need to handle twigs to build a nest or sticks to build a shelter, whatever it is.
731000	735000	We need to be able to latch on to something, precisely target it and get it.
735000	746000	And that's so important that, in a way, one whole half of one's brain is largely geared to this particular end, that of power.
746000	753000	But if you pay only that attention to the world, then you will be very vulnerable because you won't see the predator.
753000	759000	You won't see your conspecifics. You won't see everything else that's going on of which you need to be aware.
759000	769000	And so, effectively, this is a difference in which one hemisphere pays a very narrowly targeted, precise attention to a detail in order to grab it.
769000	776000	And another kind of attention which is broad, open, sustained and vigilant and on the lookout for everything else.
776000	778000	Putting it very simply.
778000	781000	Those two kinds of attention change what we find.
781000	788000	No neurodigital world will dispute that the two hemispheres attend differently. It's very clear they do.
788000	793000	And no philosopher will dispute the fact that attention changes what it is you see.
793000	800000	So, at the end of this, fairly obviously, if we attend in two different ways, we see two different worlds.
800000	805000	I'm going to grossly simplify here.
805000	812000	But effectively, in one, that of the left hemisphere, the world is made up of little bits that attract attention.
812000	816000	And they're things that we're already targeted on because we know we want them.
816000	824000	They're isolated, they're decontextualized, they belong to categories, they're abstracted and effectively lifeless.
824000	830000	Whereas in the right hemisphere, it sees that everything is ultimately connected.
830000	838000	It's connected, obviously, to the context of things that are immediately around it, particularly powerful, but it's ultimately connected to everything beyond that.
838000	843000	That the world is never fixed in the way the left hemisphere needs to fix things in order to grab them.
843000	851000	It's not built up out of slices or pieces, but is, in fact, a whole seamless flow, a very important word.
851000	858000	And in this right hemisphere, implicit meaning is understood because that's contextualized.
858000	864000	And part of the context of that is emotion, the body, other people, the world at large.
864000	873000	You've got a kind of mechanistic reductionist world, subtended by the left hemisphere, which is just a representation or a useful diagram.
873000	881000	And you've got a living, complex world, on the other hand, which has characteristics which are very much harder to pin down,
881000	884000	but involve all the richness and meaning in life.
884000	891000	So what I believe, and in the masternities I'm assuming my earlier book I traced in the second part,
891000	899000	a sort of path through the history of the West from the ancient Greeks to the modern time, in which there were rises and fallings of civilization,
899000	906000	and in which what happened was that in each civilization, the two ways of seeing the world were used fruitfully together.
906000	909000	And this is not a difference just between science and the arts.
909000	913000	Science needs both kinds of attention. The arts need both kinds of attention.
913000	919000	And this is how they flourished to begin with and were highly creative, but over a length of time they overreached themselves.
919000	922000	They became too big. They became stereotypes.
922000	927000	They needed global administration that could be rolled out to parts of an empire.
927000	939000	And so we entered into a world very much like that of the left hemisphere and very soon the civilization, either the Greek or the Roman collapsed after this moment appeared.
939000	942000	I mean, a complex story, but that's it in our play.
942000	954000	And I think that we're in another, a third wave of this, if you like, in the West, which began in the Renaissance with an incredible flourishing
954000	966000	and almost unequaled anywhere in the world at any time of everything, of interest in the sciences, in the heavens, in art, in sculpture, in music, in poetry.
966000	969000	This is an incredibly rich time.
969000	980000	And then from about the end of the 17th century, very roughly, with the scientific revolution, we began to believe that we could understand everything in terms of mechanisms.
980000	988000	And this was a useful way to think and indeed let me be the first to say that we have benefited from it in many ways.
988000	992000	We have developments that very few of us would wish to be without as a result of it.
992000	995000	But unfortunately, it led to a philosophical error.
995000	999000	And it's not just as it were a philosophical error in an abstract way.
999000	1003000	It's one that runs deep to the nature of how we experience the world.
1003000	1012000	That is, we believe that the world is made up of parts and that we find reality by going down and down and down until we've got bits that are almost identical to one another.
1012000	1020000	Whereas in fact, almost the opposite is true, that everything happens out of the coming together into complex holes.
1020000	1031000	Now, when I say coming together, I'm suggesting that we do actually temporarily start from, or temporarily, from parts, but we don't.
1031000	1037000	In our minds, in the left hemisphere, we start from parts, but in reality, things are whole.
1037000	1042000	And what we call parts are holes of another level and they can't be understood only by the parts.
1042000	1051000	This is a theory which is sometimes called a Gestalt theory, because the Germans have this word Gestalt, which we don't have an exact equivalent,
1051000	1056000	or which means a hole which cannot be accounted for by the sum of the pieces, the parts.
1056000	1058000	We've lost that insight.
1058000	1068000	And I think that what has happened is that a combination of factors, and it's not exhaustive, but the rise of capitalism, the development of empires,
1069000	1082000	both geographical empires and commercial empires, thinking in terms of global generalizations have led us away from the reality,
1082000	1092000	which is always unique, implicit, wrapped up with value, not just being sort of facts on their own.
1092000	1101000	Which is not to say, by the way, that I don't have any tract myself with the idea that we all just make it all up to suit ourselves.
1101000	1102000	No, that's not the case.
1102000	1110000	But nonetheless, our reality is something we experience as a relationship between us observing and whatever it is that it's observed.
1110000	1111000	And this goes both ways.
1111000	1114000	We are affected by it and we affect what we see.
1114000	1117000	We literally change what there is there to see.
1117000	1126000	Now, that vision is quite different from the one we have, that if only we can master more and more using left hemisphere kinds of mechanism,
1126000	1132000	we will achieve power and power will make us happy, but the roots of happiness are very other than that.
1132000	1134000	I'm sure we'll come on to that.
1134000	1143000	But effectively, we think we've accounted for everything when we think in terms of matter, but much more important are values, a sense of purpose.
1143000	1146000	And as far as I'm concerned, a sense of the sacred.
1146000	1153000	That's really where we're at. And I think recovering some of what we've lost is critical to making any progress.
1153000	1156000	We can't just stick sticking plasters on the cancer.
1156000	1165000	We need to eradicate the cause and change the way in which we think about ourselves, the world and how we relate to it.
1165000	1174000	Before we move to John's opening comments for those who aren't familiar, would you explain why you use the term master in emissary?
1174000	1184000	This is a kind of a fable in which there is a wise spiritual master who looks after a small community so well that it flourishes and grows.
1184000	1193000	After a while, he realizes he can't look after all the business of the community himself, not just because there's now too much of it, which is part of it,
1193000	1202000	but also because if he's to maintain his overall vision and to see the whole, he mustn't get distracted by detailed bureaucratic concerns.
1202000	1211000	So he appoints his brightest and best to be his emissary and go about and do the administrative stuff, a high level assistant.
1211000	1219000	And unfortunately, that assistant is hubristic, knowing much less than the master he thinks he knows at all.
1219000	1222000	And he thinks, in fact, of course, he is the real master.
1222000	1230000	And because of his lack of knowledge of what it is he doesn't know, he, the master and the civilization fall into ruins.
1230000	1238000	And that obviously is an allegory, which could be applied, I believe can be directly applied to the idea of the relationship between these hemispheres,
1238000	1243000	because one of them actually sees much more is wiser.
1243000	1246000	And, you know, I'm not just using figures of speech.
1246000	1256000	We know, and in the book I demonstrate how we know that the right hemisphere is not just more emotionally and socially intelligent, which many people might assume is the case,
1256000	1259000	but also more cognitively intelligent.
1259000	1265000	So that where we have some evidence about what has happened to somebody's IQ.
1265000	1275000	We have measurements before and after say a stroke, where there has been a significant drop in IQ, the insult is almost always in the right hemisphere.
1275000	1281000	So it's very important that the right hemisphere should remain the position of the master.
1281000	1288000	And as long as the emissary follows the direction of the master that sees more, it's very helpful and useful.
1288000	1293000	It's a good servant of the very poor master.
1293000	1304000	So the question of why in the global civilization, the emissary became dominant relative to the master is something I want to get back to.
1304000	1307000	But thank you very much, those great opening.
1307000	1317000	And something I should have shared in the opening is I have tremendous respect for both Ian and John's work.
1317000	1333000	Both have done these kind of very deep histories of Western philosophy and very meaningful worldviews that address the nature of mind, the meaning crisis.
1333000	1336000	And yeah, I'm very honored to be in the conversation.
1336000	1343000	It's why I wanted to get both of your perspectives on the underlying drivers of the metacrisis that are inside of human mind experience and cognition.
1343000	1347000	So John, similarly, I would love to hear your opening thoughts.
1347000	1352000	You've done very deep presentation of what you call the meaning crisis.
1352000	1362000	Yeah, and what I'd like to do as well as I'm doing my presentation, I'd like to show some deep lines of convergence with Ian and I have spoken before.
1362000	1367000	And we've often realized that there's a lot of convergence.
1367000	1376000	And one of the things I'm hoping to do is in this with you, but for us to unpack that even more because we have more limited conversations in the past.
1376000	1381000	So I'm going to start, I will get back to the history in a minute.
1381000	1383000	I want to start with the present.
1383000	1392000	Okay, 2019 national survey, very comprehensive survey, 80% of people found that their lives are meaningless.
1392000	1394000	Interesting.
1394000	1406000	43% think that's because of financial reason and that goes against a lot of the data that we have that once your finances get you out of poverty, they do not contribute very much to meaning in life.
1406000	1416000	34% seem to be getting a little bit closer, at least in an intuitive way, when they they attribute their lack of meaning to anxiety.
1416000	1418000	And let's just be very careful about this.
1418000	1428000	Anxiety isn't the same thing as fear fear you have a definite object something the left hemisphere with very much there's the definitive thing I can point my attention to it and focus on it hard.
1428000	1432000	Anxiety tends to be more atmospheric.
1432000	1436000	It is generally associated with the right hemisphere.
1436000	1442000	And so what you've got with anxiety is you've got a negligent sense of disconnection.
1442000	1450000	And this brings with it a sense of concern arousal stress.
1450000	1457000	And of course, horror is exactly the aesthetic of when you feel like you're losing a grip on reality.
1457000	1460000	So anxiety is on the same arc as horror.
1460000	1462000	Most of our horror movies are not actually horror movies.
1462000	1467000	They're just startle movies where somebody something jumps out at you and scares you but genuine horror movies.
1467000	1469000	They give you a sense of what I'm talking about.
1469000	1472000	No, anxiety is low grade horror in that sense.
1472000	1475000	So people are drifting along.
1475000	1490000	And then what we can ask is there's what does that have significant consequences and we know from the extensive literature on meaning in life, not meaning of life, which I'll make a distinction in a few minutes, meaning in life or a related psychological literature,
1490000	1493000	especially the work of Kelly Allen, the sense of belonging.
1493000	1497000	You don't have meaning in life if you don't have a sense of belonging you're in serious trouble.
1497000	1508000	Psychologically, physiologically, socially, probably predictively your overall health, probably your social economic status is predictive of lots of stuff going bad.
1508000	1518000	Of course, it's ultimately predictive of anxiety and depression, which by the way are flip sides of the same overall disorientation, disconnection problem.
1518000	1520000	It's predictive of course of suicide.
1521000	1527000	Although Tatya and Chanel has found evidence that people don't have to go through clinical depression.
1527000	1533000	Contrary to what we think, they can just experience meaninglessness and go right to suicide without going through clinical depression.
1533000	1536000	So just on its own it's predictive too.
1536000	1548000	So 80% of a population has the state that we have pretty comprehensive evidence is very deleterious to their health.
1548000	1555000	And then you have a lot of sort of cultural sense that this is happening.
1555000	1562000	So the book I did with Christopher Master Pietro and Philip Misovic on zombies, what did zombies become so prevalent?
1562000	1573000	And the idea is zombies are a mythgram that has arisen to sort of express, not necessarily articulate or explain, but express meaning crisis.
1573000	1575000	We'll think about them, right?
1575000	1578000	They lead by definition meaningless lives.
1578000	1579000	They've lost intelligibility.
1579000	1581000	They can't speak.
1581000	1584000	They move in collectivities, but they form no communities.
1584000	1585000	They drift aimlessly.
1585000	1588000	Unlike other monsters, they don't have any supernatural connection.
1588000	1593000	They're just us decayed and perpetually decayed.
1593000	1599000	They're a perversion of the Christian myth of resurrection because they do not come back to the fuller life.
1599000	1601000	They come back to the lesser life.
1601000	1606000	And then they got, they got linked to another Christian myth, the apocalypse, which was supposed to be the renewal of the world.
1606000	1610000	But instead it's the ongoing endless decadence of the world.
1610000	1614000	So the zombie mythology is a cultural expression of this.
1614000	1617000	And you can also see all kinds of symptoms.
1617000	1619000	Of course, we have the mental health issues.
1619000	1626000	Death of despair in the United States and the UK are becoming serious, serious problems related phenomena.
1626000	1638000	The UK has set up this Orwellian thing called the Ministry of Loneliness, which is like, because the number of close friends we've been having has gone down.
1638000	1648000	And Eberstadt has shown in her book, how the West really lost God is this also has what you might call philosophical, even spiritual consequences.
1648000	1661000	Because there's a direct correlation between how much people live atomically and alone and how secular the society has become and how sort of shallow people's ontology.
1661000	1667000	Yes, I'm not sure about her causal picture, but the correlation is just undeniable.
1667000	1669000	So this is having huge effects.
1669000	1671000	You get it in the virtual exodus.
1671000	1675000	People want to live in the virtual world rather than the real world.
1675000	1678000	They express this as an explosive thing.
1678000	1682000	And I think we can get a bit of insight into what's going on.
1682000	1684000	What's missing in the meaning processes?
1684000	1686000	What are they finding there that they're not finding here?
1686000	1688000	But let me just finish a couple more symptoms.
1688000	1703000	We've got the weird political paradox that everybody feels disillusioned and disenfranchised, but the political sphere has been has been now reappropriated and filled with religious fervor and symbolic religious behavior.
1703000	1707000	And we've given over identity and a meaning in life to our political ideologies.
1707000	1711000	Even though we've lost faith in all of the institutions, weird thing.
1711000	1713000	You have positive symptoms though.
1713000	1715000	You have the mindfulness revolution.
1715000	1719000	People are seeking fundamental transformation in attention awareness.
1719000	1722000	You have the rise of ancient wisdom philosophies.
1722000	1726000	There are more stoics now alive than we're ever alive in the Roman Empire.
1726000	1741000	And of course you have the ongoing thing basically from Schopenhauer on of the increasing investigations into Asiatic philosophies in which philosophy and spirituality, knowledge and wisdom were not separated.
1741000	1744000	And so that whole symptomology.
1744000	1746000	Let's go back to the video game.
1746000	1752000	What are they getting in a video game that they're obviously lacking in the real world?
1752000	1754000	Well, what they have is they have a narrative structure.
1754000	1763000	There's a narrative structure that tells them what the story is and what part they play in it and audience them towards a purpose.
1763000	1765000	So purpose.
1765000	1767000	They have a nomological structure.
1767000	1768000	What do I mean by that?
1768000	1773000	They have a sense of there's a set of rules, laws and rules that make sense of that world.
1773000	1775000	So they understand how that world works.
1775000	1777000	This is intelligibility of coherence.
1777000	1780000	Second, that purpose coherence.
1780000	1782000	Third, what else is going on in that?
1782000	1784000	Well, they have a normative structure.
1784000	1786000	They know how to self-transcend.
1786000	1788000	They can level up.
1788000	1792000	There's a way in which self-transcendence is available to them.
1792000	1795000	And fourth, they get into the flow state.
1795000	1801000	They get into a state where they feel dynamically coupled and connected to their environment.
1801000	1802000	So what do we have?
1802000	1805000	These are the four factors of meaning in life.
1805000	1809000	These are the things that you have when you have meaning in life.
1809000	1811000	And contrary to what our culture says,
1811000	1815000	purpose is one of them, but purpose is not the synonym for all of them,
1815000	1817000	nor is it the most important of the dimensions.
1817000	1822000	You need to have purpose, but it's not the same as meaning in life,
1822000	1826000	nor is it sufficient for meaning in life.
1826000	1828000	The next, coherence.
1828000	1831000	The world can't be absurd to people.
1831000	1835000	Third, you need significance.
1835000	1840000	What that means is you need something that gives you a normative staircase,
1840000	1846000	something that gives you a way by which you can get in touch with the really real.
1846000	1850000	We've got from the psychedelic renaissance and the work in Mystical Experience,
1850000	1859000	and I'm involved in that, that people seek out for its own sake this relationship with the really real, the more real.
1859000	1863000	And once they get it, they will, they're willing to change their whole lives
1863000	1866000	so that they are in deeper contact with that really real.
1866000	1870000	And Yadin has shown their lives actually by many objective measures get better.
1870000	1872000	So that matters.
1872000	1874000	The third one, the flow state.
1874000	1878000	The flow state is a very powerful, and Chik-Sent-Maha'i has done a lot of work on that.
1878000	1880000	We could perhaps talk about that.
1880000	1885000	The flow state is a very powerful version of the fourth factor, which is mattering.
1885000	1893000	People need to feel that they are connected to something that has a reality and a value beyond their own individual existence.
1893000	1898000	So to find this out, you ask somebody, what do you want to exist even if you don't?
1898000	1901000	And how much of a difference do you make to it now?
1901000	1907000	You could grab all of these things together, and they all fold into this connectedness in sense-making.
1907000	1912000	We're connected to the world, we're ordered to the world, the world makes fundamental sense to us.
1912000	1917000	We fit into the world, we belong in the world, belonging, sense of belonging, sense of meaning, and love.
1917000	1927000	My proposal is that that can ultimately be understood as reflecting sort of the core of human cognition.
1927000	1929000	I talk about the core four.
1929000	1933000	I think we've split them up for analytic reasons, right?
1933000	1939000	Which is attention, consciousness, working memory, and fluid general intelligence.
1939000	1943000	But I think they're all just four different dimensions of an underlying core thing.
1943000	1948000	And there's good functional evidence, behavioral evidence, and anatomical evidence for that claim.
1948000	1954000	I won't review all of that, but I'll just take it that that could be agreed without much controversy.
1954000	1972000	What I think those, that general ability, that general intelligence reflects is it reflects two metaproblems that you have to solve whenever you're solving any problem you're trying to solve in the world.
1972000	1974000	And I understand there's two kinds of problems.
1974000	1980000	There's problems that are solved by having something, controlling it, and there are problems that are solved by becoming something.
1980000	1985000	From's distinction, which maps on a lot also to the left and right in many ways.
1985000	1987000	And we'll get back to that.
1987000	1992000	But what I think these two metaproblems are, and think about your intuition.
1992000	2000000	We tend to attribute intelligence to a creature the more we can see reliable evidence that it can anticipate its world.
2000000	2002000	Because, of course, an ounce of prevention.
2002000	2007000	The more you can anticipate the world, the more powerful your causal intervention.
2007000	2012000	If I can avoid the tiger, that's way less costly than fighting the tiger, just to put, right.
2012000	2027000	And so the thing is, as you push out sort of the light cone of your anticipation of the world, what you get is you get an explosion of the amount of information, all the possible alternative pathways to get into your goal.
2027000	2030000	This just explodes in possibility.
2030000	2033000	So even to take a very limited case, here's my initial state.
2033000	2034000	I'm starting a game of chess.
2034000	2036000	I'm trying to get to the end.
2036000	2041000	All the number of alternative pathways outnumbers the number of atomic particles in the universe.
2041000	2048000	And this is one of the core problems going back to Newell and Simon that is at the heart of the AGI project, right.
2048000	2050000	And so this is what you can't do.
2050000	2052000	You can't check all that information.
2052000	2055000	Think about all the things I could pay attention to.
2055000	2056000	It's overwhelming.
2056000	2058000	Think about all the things I could remember.
2058000	2063000	Think about all the different combinations of sequences of sounds and movements.
2063000	2070000	And yet what we're all doing is we're just zeroing in on it right now.
2070000	2074000	And what that means is it's not that you check everything.
2074000	2075000	You can't.
2075000	2077000	That would take the rest of your life.
2077000	2082000	Somehow, and this is really important, you ignore most of what's relevant.
2082000	2085000	Sorry, you ignore most of what's irrelevant.
2085000	2086000	You ignore it.
2086000	2088000	You zero in on what's relevant.
2088000	2091000	Now that's not cold calculation.
2091000	2096000	And this is where I, like, this is a matter of care.
2096000	2099000	We're different from AGI still.
2099000	2102000	How long is something we could potentially call.
2102000	2105000	We care about the information we're processing.
2105000	2106000	Computers don't.
2106000	2108000	We care about whether or not it's true.
2108000	2111000	Computers don't, right.
2111000	2116000	So it's not just that relevance is not just, it's not just a calculation.
2116000	2117000	It's a matter of caring.
2117000	2121000	It's a matter of commitment because whenever I'm doing this, I'm taking a chance.
2121000	2127000	I have to commit to this because when I'm paying attention to Ian, I'm not paying attention to what's behind me.
2127000	2128000	There's a cost.
2128000	2130000	There's always a cost.
2130000	2134000	So there's existential risk at whenever I'm doing it.
2134000	2138000	So there's caring, committed, connectedness.
2138000	2141000	And notice relevance is a connecting relation.
2141000	2144000	It's like biological fittedness, right?
2144000	2146000	Relevance isn't in the object.
2146000	2148000	It isn't in the subject.
2148000	2152000	Relevance is that would bind this objective and the objective together.
2152000	2154000	I call it transjective, right?
2154000	2165000	So that and for the name for all of that I use is religio, the sense of binding that carries with it a sense of profound meaning.
2165000	2180000	And I put it to you that when people have access to profound meaning in all of these dimensions, they get a sense of the sacred and inexhaustible fountive intelligibility that is not just an intellectual affair, but this connected living affair.
2180000	2184000	But here's the problem.
2184000	2192000	The very processes that make you intelligently adaptive make you perpetually prone to self deception.
2192000	2196000	This is my reinterpretation of the first noble truth, right?
2196000	2205000	Because the very process that gets me to be adaptive by focusing in and binding myself.
2205000	2207000	I mean this seriously.
2207000	2209000	This is normative for me and bound.
2209000	2210000	This is what I should do.
2210000	2212000	I should be paying attention to Ian.
2212000	2215000	It means I'm ignoring so much.
2215000	2223000	And often what we ignore can turn out to be the relevant information that we actually need to solve whatever problems we're facing.
2223000	2227000	So we are perpetually prone to self deception.
2227000	2231000	And I want to talk just a little bit about this is at multiple levels.
2231000	2236000	But what that means is and this is a trade off relationship.
2236000	2244000	Whenever you try and solve one way in which you're being deceived, you open yourself up to an alternative way in which you can be.
2244000	2246000	So I should pay attention to it.
2246000	2247000	No, no, no.
2247000	2249000	And then I'll lose the right.
2249000	2252000	I'm always in a trade off between what should I foreground?
2252000	2253000	What should I background?
2253000	2258000	And so it's a very complex process.
2258000	2259000	It's very complex.
2259000	2261000	It's very dynamic.
2261000	2266000	It's co-created by the world and me and also me and other people.
2266000	2273000	Very complex, very dynamic, very adaptive, very prone to self deceptive,
2273000	2277000	self destructive behavior, both individually and collectively.
2277000	2284000	So cultures across the world have had to deal with this really tricky problem.
2284000	2290000	How do we ameliorate the self deception without undermining the adaptive connectedness?
2290000	2292000	Because we can't just shut it off.
2292000	2293000	And we have all these trade offs.
2293000	2297000	We can't just pursue simple panaceas that will just do this.
2297000	2299000	So we have to get this complex.
2299000	2302000	I call it an ecology of practices practices that intervene.
2302000	2308000	And our cognition, our attention, our awareness in multiple places in checks and balances.
2308000	2312000	Very like think of the eight fold path of Buddhism.
2312000	2314000	It's this complex set of practices.
2314000	2319000	And they're represented by a spoke wheel because they all interconnect and they're all self organizing.
2319000	2326000	And when you do that, you need to set that within a community that homes you.
2326000	2331000	Because you need people who have been practicing it because this is just this is not a matter just of theory.
2331000	2333000	This is a matter of transformation.
2333000	2336000	And they need to be able to guide you along the way.
2336000	2340000	And then that community has to be set in a world view that legitimates it.
2340000	2342000	A world view that legitimates it.
2342000	2349000	So another way of understanding the meeting crisis is that unlike most cultures,
2349000	2352000	we don't know where to go to cultivate wisdom.
2352000	2358000	We don't know where to go to ameliorate that self deceptive, self destructive behavior, foolishness.
2358000	2362000	We don't know where to go to enhance the connectedness, the religious.
2362000	2365000	So it gets us into deep connection.
2365000	2368000	And we used to have a world view that gave us both of that.
2368000	2369000	This is how you connect deeper.
2369000	2373000	And this is how you overcome your fallenness of all use of metaphor.
2373000	2379000	And that was the sacred, the sacred canopy, the religious frameworks were the places that gave us world views,
2379000	2382000	traditions and ecologies of practices for addressing this.
2382000	2387000	And because of the Protestant Reformation, the scientific revolution,
2387000	2390000	actually I would even start it in medieval nominalism.
2390000	2391000	Yes, I agree.
2391000	2392000	Thank you.
2392000	2393000	And a lot of things.
2393000	2401000	And then this has just been put on methamphetamine basically since the advent of some of the hyper technologies.
2401000	2405000	We are in a position where we don't have a sacred canopy.
2405000	2408000	We don't have a, I asked my students, where do you go for information?
2408000	2409000	They have their phones.
2409000	2410000	Where do you go for science?
2410000	2412000	They're sort of hesitant, postmodern concern.
2412000	2417000	But I guess, you know, I go to science for knowledge, right?
2417000	2421000	That's the reasoning what the words Kansasia actually just meant was knowledge.
2421000	2425000	Then I ask them where they go for wisdom and they don't have an answer.
2425000	2437000	And they know that without wisdom, meaning in life is tremendously at risk.
2437000	2441000	There are so many things in that that I would love to respond to.
2441000	2444000	But I don't, I mean, perhaps Andrew, you would like to talk.
2444000	2448000	Yeah, I mean, I think we get to play with relevance realization in real time.
2448000	2452000	Because I would like to go into zombies and video games and all kinds of things,
2452000	2458000	but feeling into the highest useful, the questions on my mind,
2458000	2460000	I'd like to hear what's on yours is.
2460000	2462000	So thank you.
2462000	2465000	And both having shared kind of opening frames.
2465000	2470000	Two top questions for both of you is ideology.
2470000	2471000	So how did we get here?
2471000	2475000	How did we get to ubiquitous meaninglessness and nowhere to go for wisdom?
2475000	2478000	How did we get to the master and the emissary backwards culturally?
2478000	2484000	And what is the relationship between this interior psychological phenomena
2484000	2489000	and the objective environmental catastrophes, nuclear risk,
2489000	2492000	AI risk, economic issues that we have in the world?
2492000	2494000	So how did we get here?
2494000	2498000	And how does the interior and the exterior relate?
2498000	2501000	What are the kind of causal dynamics, both directions?
2501000	2505000	I would love to hear.
2505000	2508000	Perhaps you wouldn't mind if I don't immediately address those questions.
2508000	2510000	But you've got somewhere else.
2510000	2514000	Some more burning things that came up and we can come to that as you've announced them
2514000	2516000	and we will come to them, I'm sure.
2516000	2522000	One was a reflection on what you were saying at the end, John,
2522000	2530000	about we can only attend to so much, we can only remember so much,
2530000	2536000	and we all need to balance the benefits and risks of everything we do carry.
2536000	2542000	As Heidegger said, every revelation of truth is the hiding of something.
2542000	2545000	And I think that is really important.
2545000	2549000	And what this brings to mind for me is a couple of things.
2549000	2554000	One is that filtering is creative.
2554000	2559000	That if you like filtering of light is how we get coloured patterns,
2559000	2564000	we get films and so forth, life like a dome of many coloured glass stains,
2564000	2567000	the white gradients of eternity, Shelley.
2567000	2571000	So less is often more.
2571000	2576000	And part of shaping and intelligence is knowing what to get rid of
2576000	2580000	because you try to take too much and it wouldn't benefit.
2580000	2585000	The other thing about it is that it's not just a trade-off in the sense,
2585000	2587000	well, we need a bit of this and we need a bit of that.
2587000	2589000	That is kind of true.
2589000	2599000	But everything contains within it, if viewed in my mind anyway, if viewed as a whole.
2599000	2602000	It has a relationship with its opposite.
2602000	2605000	And it only exists because of the being an opposite.
2605000	2609000	So it's like the two poles of a bar magnet.
2609000	2613000	You can't have the north or the south because they coexist and co-create.
2613000	2617000	And so what one is trying to do is rather like in the magnet
2617000	2622000	or in a torched string of a musical instrument or the torched string of a bow,
2622000	2626000	is to hold two things together that both need to be held,
2626000	2632000	just go flabbily to a point in the middle because then the string goes slack
2632000	2636000	and you've got no power for the arrow to fly or the note to take off from the loop.
2636000	2640000	So I think that's something important that we ought to bear in mind
2640000	2642000	is this relationship between the thing and its opposite.
2642000	2649000	Actually, it also, if I may say, because I was listening to your talk last night,
2649000	2653000	or the night before, to the Consilience Conference.
2653000	2658000	And one of the things I think there was this idea that,
2658000	2663000	well, you made a lot of interesting points,
2663000	2668000	but one of them was to do with, I've forgotten it.
2672000	2675000	What was the transjective relating the subject of an object?
2675000	2676000	Yeah, there's a bit of that.
2676000	2679000	Well, there might have been something, and maybe because, let me try,
2679000	2682000	maybe there's a wrong, one of the things I was trying to emphasize
2682000	2684000	and one of the things that a recovery of Neoplatonism,
2684000	2686000	especially given filler's work on it,
2686000	2691000	can give us is a re-emphasis on the polarity rather than the poles.
2691000	2693000	And I was talking about this.
2693000	2696000	I try to use the Greek word tonos rather than tension.
2696000	2697000	I do too.
2697000	2700000	Yeah, because the English word tension is almost purely negative now for us.
2700000	2701000	Yeah, that's right.
2701000	2703000	Tonos, like Heraclitus, the tonos of the boat.
2703000	2704000	The tautness of the string, yeah.
2704000	2706000	And without the tautness, there is no energy.
2706000	2707000	That's right.
2707000	2711000	And whatever comes out of the tautness is orthogonal to the tautness.
2711000	2715000	And that's so the arrow flies off at right angles and notes come out in a way.
2715000	2718000	So it's a very important aspect of creativity.
2718000	2720000	I just wanted to reflect on that.
2720000	2725000	I wanted to comment very briefly on what you said about anxiety in the hemispheres.
2725000	2726000	Yeah.
2726000	2733000	I don't think anxiety and depression in my experience are just parts of the same thing.
2733000	2736000	I think they're actually, they can coexist,
2736000	2740000	but they're not the same thing at all and they don't need to coexist.
2741000	2743000	Anxiety, I think, is not lateralized.
2743000	2749000	So I think there is anxiety created by the left and by the right hemisphere and each of them holds it.
2749000	2754000	Depression is a complex one and I don't want to go into it in any detail,
2754000	2765000	but some depressions seem to me to be due to an unbalanced overactivity or unopposed activity of the right frontal cortex.
2765000	2769000	And that can be unopposed either by the left frontal cortex or by the right posterior cortex.
2769000	2770000	Yes.
2770000	2771000	So it's slightly complicated.
2771000	2774000	I just want to put that on record because people may go away and say,
2774000	2779000	well, I thought you said, you know, and that's not what anywhere I said, but...
2781000	2789000	I was just trying to, yeah, I was trying to indicate that the phenomenology tends to be much more atmosphere in both of those.
2789000	2792000	Depression and anxiety rather than narrow focus.
2792000	2794000	It's wide focused and ambiguous rather than...
2794000	2796000	To that extent, yes.
2796000	2800000	But actually in terms of where they originate hemisphere wise,
2800000	2806000	I think it's hard to be more specific in the way you seem to be saying.
2806000	2812000	And then there are just a couple of other things that I want to pick up because we don't have to exhaust them.
2812000	2816000	We can't exhaust them now, but we would want to sort of perhaps come to them.
2816000	2823000	One is about purpose and its nature and the other is about values and meaning.
2824000	2828000	So I agree with you that meaning and purpose are not the same thing,
2828000	2834000	but it's very important to make a distinction that will be familiar to all three of us,
2834000	2838000	but may not be in the minds of some people watching or listening.
2838000	2843000	And that is the difference between what I call extrinsic purpose and intrinsic purpose.
2843000	2846000	An example of extrinsic purpose is a photocopier.
2846000	2851000	Its purpose is it was created to copy a sheet of paper and make another image.
2851000	2856000	But the other thing is that the purpose doesn't lie outside itself, but in itself.
2856000	2859000	They are in themselves purposeful.
2859000	2864000	Actually, I believe the prayers of this kind, it's in itself valuable, not because it produces a result,
2864000	2869000	but also very obviously things like music and dance are not pointless,
2869000	2875000	but they're not validated by a purpose that comes out, we have better health for it.
2875000	2877000	No, they have value in themselves.
2877000	2881000	And the last thing I just wanted to raise and say that when we're going forward,
2881000	2886000	we can come back to and preference these things is that very often people,
2886000	2891000	I mean, you said that we need meaning and we need to be directed.
2891000	2895000	And I believe that values are things that draw us from in front rather than pushes from behind
2895000	2900000	and purpose also beckons to us from in front and draws us forward.
2900000	2904000	And of course, all our models are pushed from behind because they're mechanical,
2904000	2910000	but very importantly, these things exist as it were at the same time as our striving towards them
2910000	2914000	and actually cause us to strive towards them, not by pushing us,
2914000	2917000	but by calling to us, evoking a response.
2917000	2926000	And that we ought to be careful not to think that because of a frailty of the human spirit,
2926000	2930000	we must find meaning in a basically meaning those cosmos.
2930000	2933000	We must paint values on the walls of ourselves.
2933000	2937000	So you're not saying this, but I just thought it would be worth clarifying.
2937000	2944000	We don't have to sort of cheer ourselves up by painting pretty pictures on the walls of a hermetically sealed cell.
2944000	2947000	I reject that completely and I imagine you do too.
2947000	2955000	Indeed, we are contacting something which is real and I actually think that those values and purpose are essential to the cosmos.
2955000	2958000	They're not things we made up.
2958000	2963000	So I don't want to exclude Daniel from the conversation, but I feel called to respond, but I want to make this a place for you.
2963000	2967000	I have some questions I'll follow up with, but please go ahead.
2967000	2975000	So, yeah, I mean, that distinction that you made, and this is just to provide convergence,
2975000	2978000	like it's well established in the lit, you know,
2978000	2988000	Emma Bile talked about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and then the intrinsic motivation is much more predictive of creativity and insight than extrinsic.
2988000	2990000	But you actually need a bit.
2990000	2999000	Optimal creativity is to have a mixture of the two because you need the extrinsic when you're painting the Sistine Chapel and you're painting the blue of the sky and you just got to keep going.
2999000	3000000	Right.
3001000	3008000	And it also gives you corrective feedback because if you're just intrinsic, you don't have external judges and things like that.
3008000	3011000	But yes, I think that's important.
3011000	3014000	And I think that brings out an important difference.
3014000	3024000	I think the things that we think are intrinsically motivated, motivating are precisely the ones that get us into that state of connectedness, religio.
3024000	3029000	Optimal intrinsic motivation being realized as a flow state, you do the flow state to be in the flow state.
3029000	3031000	You don't do it for any other reason.
3031000	3032000	Right.
3032000	3038000	And that sense of it, one minute, that sense of super salience, that's the beginning of the taste of the sacred as well.
3038000	3051000	And so I think the sacred is how does reality disclose itself to us where we're in that mode of not work, but serious play that we're doing for its own sake because all we're doing like playing music or going to a play.
3051000	3052000	Yes.
3053000	3055000	We're playing with relevance realization.
3055000	3058000	In this serious sense, we're playing with it.
3058000	3064000	And we're playing with salience and we're saying, if I play with this, what kind of world is available to me?
3064000	3065000	And I agree.
3065000	3075000	I think, especially given the work of L.A. Paul and Agnes Calard and aspiration, that we need to bring back the aspirational dimension, that we are bound.
3075000	3076000	Right.
3076000	3078000	We're bound to the future in the right way.
3078000	3083000	And what's come out of this, and this is, it allows me to make another point.
3083000	3086000	And I know we have different language about this, but I think we converged.
3086000	3087000	It's interesting.
3087000	3092000	It's part of what's come out of the way to do this is to quickly describe an experiment.
3092000	3093000	Okay.
3093000	3102000	So you go into a bunch of academics and you say, you give them all the evidence, all the arguments that they should start saving for retirement right now.
3102000	3105000	Take any challenges, any questions.
3105000	3107000	You come back in six months, none of them are saving.
3107000	3117000	And that's to do with what's called hyperbolic discounting and the way our evolutionary machinery makes distance, things in the, in the distance, much less salient to us than currents.
3117000	3118000	And that's why you procrastinate.
3118000	3120000	It's why you eat the chocolate cake when you're trying to lose weight.
3120000	3121000	Right.
3121000	3123000	And it's very adaptive because you don't get that.
3123000	3125000	You're just overwhelmed by possibilities.
3125000	3126000	Right.
3126000	3131000	But now you come back to them and you say, okay, what I want you to do is I want you to practice this every day.
3131000	3133000	Notice it's a practice, not just a belief.
3133000	3135000	I want you to practice every day.
3135000	3149000	I want you to practice like imagining and we should talk about two kinds of imagination at some point, but I want you to imagine your future self as a family, a beloved family member that you've always cared for and you need to continue caring for them.
3149000	3151000	And you have a lot of compassion and love for them.
3151000	3153000	And I want you to do that every day.
3153000	3156000	And you come back in six months and you find two things.
3156000	3157000	Now they're saving.
3157000	3163000	And the ones that do the practice more regularly and more vividly imagine it.
3163000	3165000	Save more.
3165000	3176000	You see what this is showing that the imaginal augmentation of the aspiration to do something actually is a constitutive part of being rational.
3176000	3184000	Descartes reduced logos since making rationality to computation.
3184000	3186000	And we've lost the fact.
3186000	3187000	No, no, no.
3187000	3194000	If I'm actually going, and this is Agnes Kellert's argument, if I'm trying to become more rational, that's an aspirational project.
3194000	3197000	That's me trying to become somebody other than whom I am.
3197000	3200000	I have to bind myself to my future self.
3200000	3201000	This is religio again.
3201000	3203000	I have to get religio with my future self.
3203000	3206000	And that's not something that I can do just inferentially.
3206000	3208000	I have to do this using imagination.
3208000	3210000	I have to use this with connect.
3210000	3218000	I agree with you profoundly that even the, even the attempts to be more rational require an aspirate.
3218000	3222000	So aspiration and rationality have to be rebound together.
3222000	3223000	Yeah.
3223000	3236000	One thing I want to push back on, but just because I know you've got, see, I'm hesitant around the word value because the notion of value comes up basically in the enlightenment.
3236000	3241000	And it's part of the is, ought distinction and things like that.
3241000	3242000	Okay.
3242000	3244000	Do you want to challenge that?
3244000	3252000	Because you don't, you don't have, you don't have this notion sort of predating the idea that value is right.
3252000	3254000	I think we're talking about terminology.
3254000	3255000	Okay.
3255000	3259000	It would be hard to say that Plato had no allegiance to the values of beauty, goodness and truth.
3259000	3260000	I don't call those values.
3260000	3264000	Well, you can call them what you like, John, but you know, let's not know what I mean.
3264000	3267000	I mean, it's not a lot of people would use different words, but you know what I mean by values.
3267000	3269000	Well, I do and I don't.
3269000	3272000	And this is what, but I want to do what you did with one of my terms.
3272000	3274000	I think most people don't hear.
3274000	3277000	See, Plato doesn't think we value them.
3277000	3279000	Plato thinks we love the transcendentals.
3279000	3280000	Right.
3280000	3284000	And value is a statement of, right, of choice and preference.
3284000	3293000	This is how Locke introduces it and makes, and you can actually see him change from, we are called by the world to we choose.
3293000	3295000	And he introduces the notion there.
3295000	3300000	And what I want to say that is because I want to make the argument again.
3300000	3305000	And this is part of the overall that love is not a purely subjective matter either.
3305000	3306000	Love is not a feeling.
3306000	3308000	Love is not an emotion.
3308000	3309000	Right.
3309000	3311000	When I love somebody that can make me happy.
3311000	3312000	It can make me.
3312000	3315000	I miss my partner right now because I love her so deeply.
3315000	3318000	It can make me angry, frustrated.
3318000	3320000	Love isn't an emotion.
3320000	3323000	It's a way of binding myself to another person.
3323000	3331000	And I think when most people hear the word value because of its enlightenment history, they hear choice and preference and what they want.
3331000	3335000	And I don't think if we think we can choose the true and the good and the beautiful.
3335000	3336000	Okay.
3336000	3337000	So clarification.
3337000	3338000	Yes.
3338000	3339000	Yes.
3339000	3341000	We don't understand that we don't choose them.
3341000	3345000	We are called by them and we are called by them to ask to aspire.
3345000	3346000	Right.
3346000	3351000	Now, I understand you're not using the word that way, but I think most people when they hear value are using it.
3351000	3352000	Well, thanks for clarifying that.
3352000	3353000	Yeah.
3353000	3354000	Yeah.
3354000	3355000	That's not what that was.
3355000	3356000	Yes.
3356000	3359000	And, you know, there's an important relationship between love and value.
3359000	3366000	Both Pascal and Shayla said that you can't actually value something until you love it.
3366000	3370000	And most people would think you don't love it until you know how to value it.
3370000	3373000	But it's an interesting alternative way of thinking.
3373000	3374000	Anyway.
3374000	3375000	I don't want to say that.
3375000	3382000	But what I want to bring in that people don't usually hear when they hear value is like Murdoch's point, like in the sovereignty of the good.
3382000	3387000	Love is the painful recognition that something other than yourself is real.
3387000	3392000	There's a connectedness to realness that's important if you're actually loving something.
3392000	3393000	Absolutely.
3393000	3394000	Yes.
3394000	3399000	Well, you know, perhaps we should go to love already, but it's a huge topic.
3399000	3403000	I mean, and I don't want to lose whatever it was Daniel was going to say.
3403000	3404000	Yeah.
3404000	3411000	But I think this was valuable because I think we took a lot of sort of the common language
3411000	3416000	of modernity and even of postmodernity, subjectivity, objectivity, all this stuff.
3416000	3426000	And we sort of put pressure on it and shown that the presupposition that this is just the natural way thought unfolds needs to be challenged.
3426000	3427000	No, no.
3427000	3431000	And above all on the subjective, objective divide, which is not to say that the terms have no meaning.
3431000	3432000	Of course not.
3432000	3436000	But I like you believe that everything comes into being out of a relation.
3436000	3437000	Yes.
3437000	3439000	There's never just that or just in here.
3439000	3440000	Yes.
3440000	3448000	But it is the coming together and encounter in fact, which is the root cause of our experience and of our love and our valuing actually.
3448000	3449000	Yes, yes.
3449000	3453000	But anyway, yeah.
3453000	3461000	So there's something challenging in what we're trying to do here, which is as we've seen what we take words to mean,
3461000	3468000	which words we use, what ontologies, what references, what epistemologies, we haven't had time to all sync these.
3468000	3474000	And as we probably all experience, I certainly have when I want to do generative work with someone that has a different background,
3474000	3479000	that's where we have to start and realize some of our disagreements are because the word means something different.
3479000	3481000	And that takes a long time.
3481000	3488000	And so I'm noticing that you mentioned intrinsic and extrinsic purpose.
3488000	3492000	You said purpose and meaning are not identical, but you didn't make the distinction.
3492000	3498000	John responded talking about intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, which is not the exact same as purpose.
3498000	3501000	And then there was a conversation around values.
3501000	3503000	There's a conversation around love around beauty.
3503000	3507000	So these are all related, but not exactly synonymous topics.
3507000	3515000	They all obviously indicate something that we value, but we're wanting to speak to value being intrinsic to reality,
3515000	3520000	not just something we make up, which is you saying we're not just painting values on a meaningless universe.
3520000	3528000	There's something about the ontologies that give us a meaningless universe that are part of the problem that we want to come to,
3528000	3534000	that I think is core to the meaning crisis, core to the place we find ourselves in and why you have to say something like,
3534000	3538000	hey, it's not that the reality is a meaningless universe that we have to paint meaning on,
3538000	3543000	but that reality has something like intrinsic purpose to it.
3543000	3551000	So I'm just acknowledging all the really fascinating topics that I'm not going to ask questions about or say anything about,
3551000	3564000	because in the short amount of time we have, feeling into what has the highest meaningfulness, beauty, worthiness of love, purpose, value,
3564000	3571000	without making further distinctions on which of those it is.
3571000	3579000	You said something about the intrinsic versus extrinsic purpose that I wanted to click on a little bit,
3579000	3587000	because extrinsic purpose being an instrumental or utilitarian concept, the purpose of X is defined by its utility to Y,
3587000	3589000	and we're assuming Y has value.
3589000	3597000	So when someone takes that definition of purpose, they take purpose first rather than meaning or value or beauty or love.
3597000	3602000	They take purpose as the thing that we're looking for, which is itself a very interesting question.
3602000	3609000	They take the relative utilitarian extrinsic definition, then they ask what's the purpose of it all.
3609000	3617000	It's obviously a meaningless question, because there's nothing outside of it all to say it is relevant with respect to,
3617000	3624000	and so it's easy to say, oh, there's no purpose to anything and come up with nihilism as opposed to just recognize it was a category or you were using too small a concept.
3624000	3629000	Now you're talking about intrinsic purpose or intrinsic beauty or intrinsic something.
3629000	3636000	Intrinsic something that is worth something, and you're saying that it also has a pulling quality or a telos, right,
3636000	3643000	that all that is has something like purpose, that is not defined with respect to anything else.
3643000	3649000	It may be hard to define it all, which the Tao would say, which sounds very much like the Tao, it has a nature, right?
3649000	3657000	So does the direction of reality or universe reveal something about its nature that is worth aligning ourselves with?
3657000	3661000	I think it's very interesting.
3661000	3671000	I want to ask, I want to propose what I think is the generator of the metacrisis in your framework,
3671000	3674000	in here your response, and then here you build on it.
3674000	3691000	But I want to just hear first the definition of purpose as extrinsic, that the philosophy of science can orient to.
3691000	3697000	So you have Big Bang where the laws are why they are, because who knows, and the constants are what they are,
3697000	3705000	and at some point consciousness pops out, and it's very easy to get nihilism in that model.
3705000	3709000	One could say that model is left-hemispheric dominance epistemically,
3709000	3715000	and that the left-hemispheric dominance can't understand purpose or meaning.
3715000	3719000	Is that how you would say it?
3719000	3730000	When we talk about, or I talk about values, I'm thinking of a hierarchy drawn up by Max Schaler,
3730000	3738000	the German early 20th century philosopher, in which he had a hierarchy of values, the base of which was utility.
3738000	3742000	And this is the lowest level of his values.
3742000	3759000	There came things like, he called them values of life, but these were values of fidelity, magnanimity, generosity, bravery, and so forth,
3759000	3762000	a lot of which seemed to have gone out of fashion.
3762000	3767000	And then above that came beauty, goodness, and truth, the spiritual or the geistic of Arthur,
3767000	3771000	and then at the top of the apex of the pyramid was the sacred.
3771000	3777000	And I think that structure has been incredibly helpful to me in seeing what we're getting wrong,
3777000	3783000	because the value, the only really driving value of the left hemisphere is utility.
3783000	3788000	It's evolved in order to serve utility for us.
3788000	3793000	And of course we need it because it's very useful.
3793000	3806000	But we mustn't think that this answers our questions or this sort of level of value is going to give us the fulfillment that is promised to us by our culture,
3806000	3814000	which is all about acquisition and greed and competition, typical values of the left hemisphere.
3814000	3821000	So when we come to talk about purpose and its relationship with meaning,
3821000	3827000	what I would say is, first of all, to make the distinction which we've really made,
3827000	3834000	but it's the distinction between Cass's finite games and infinite games.
3834000	3837000	Finite games have a purpose and when you've achieved it, the game is over.
3837000	3844000	Infinite games are things that have the value in being performed at all and therefore eternally have that value.
3844000	3853000	We've got locked into the type of belief that everything is a finite game, which it very clearly can't be.
3853000	3868000	And the things that give us meaning, I think, are for very obvious reasons not specifiable as extras it goes.
3868000	3871000	We should try and do this and make that and so on.
3871000	3878000	There's a level at which we have to guide ourselves and think, well, we need to make a conscious effort to shift our values.
3878000	3882000	But in the end, these things are not going to be of that kind.
3882000	3885000	They're going to be openness to an attractive force.
3885000	3894000	And those attractive forces are many, but they can boil down in some ways to three incredibly important things that give meaning to life,
3894000	3901000	each of which has been more or less trashed by our current civilization.
3901000	3913000	The first is our relationship with society are being bound to one another in the sense of religio.
3913000	3924000	The business of sharing one's life with people who share your values, whom you can trust, whom you can confide in, whom you can eat with, play with,
3924000	3931000	and generally share a culture which may be based on a religion but has common rituals that we all understand.
3931000	3942000	That is one thing and it is extremely difficult to find any such coherence in modern society for a host of reasons which most people will be able to fill in for themselves.
3942000	3949000	But we don't have that kind of cohesion anymore and we're increasingly isolated, partly by technology.
3949000	3951000	And we live lonely lives.
3951000	3961000	The UCLA loneliness index has shut up in recent years and I think we mentioned loneliness already.
3961000	3967000	And it's one of the key things that people say when you ask them about their lives, they say, they're lonely.
3968000	3980000	Now, meaning can't come from any purpose in being with others and belonging in the social world and contributing to it in some sort of obvious extrinsic way.
3980000	3983000	You can't specify ahead of time what that value will be.
3983000	3986000	You only know it in the experiencing of it.
3986000	3989000	This is the problem, it's the swimming problem.
3989000	3992000	You can't have a manual that tells you how to swim.
3992000	3994000	You sit on the bank of the river reading.
3994000	3996000	Now I know how to swim.
3996000	3998000	You have to get in the water.
3998000	4006000	The second is our relationship with the natural world in all its complexity and beauty.
4006000	4015000	So for most people until very recently, it was almost impossible for their lives not to be enmeshed with the surrounding natural world.
4015000	4021000	Only in the last perhaps 150 years also have we become isolated from nature.
4021000	4028000	And this is a really important divorce, a very, very important one.
4028000	4030000	The divorce from one another is very important.
4030000	4042000	The divorce from nature and the sense of it as an environment, which is a technical term for something that surrounds you, but not what you are born out of, which is what nature really means and what you return to.
4042000	4048000	And the third is the relationship to a realm of something beyond this.
4048000	4055000	Again, we've mentioned this, I believe, but it is the transcendent realm or the realm of the spiritual or the sacred.
4055000	4072000	And this, to a lot of people now, they've been trained to think that this is a rather negligible issue, that it really is a kind of vestige of something that hangs over from a primitive time when people weren't properly educated and they invented superstitions to try and explain life.
4073000	4082000	And I mean, that is such a terrible, terrible diminution and tragedy of what it is, travesty of what it is I'm talking about, and it is a tragedy.
4082000	4094000	So those three things are what I believe fundamentally are most important for bringing meaning to our lives.
4094000	4101000	And I can't specify, obviously, what the meaning is, you know, what is the meaning of life, a question you cannot answer, although I believe it's 43.
4101000	4106000	But that's what I would say about that.
4106000	4115000	And it relates to the hemispheres in this way, that the left hemisphere is designed only for acquisition and pleasure, getting stuff, having fun.
4115000	4118000	It's more of an energetically driven than the right hemisphere.
4118000	4122000	It's more associated with addiction than the right hemisphere.
4122000	4128000	And it's certainly more associated with getting a kick out of power and acquisition.
4128000	4138000	Whereas the right hemisphere is more able to open itself to the sacred and to these other higher values that I specify when we cap them now.
4138000	4147000	So I think there is a very important thing there that we've guided by something that literally doesn't see what it is that's pulling us or should be pulling us forward.
4147000	4157000	That sense of direction or purpose in life and the values that call us forward.
4157000	4174000	So I want to say something about this that I feel like is me restating how the hemispheric model ends up getting imbalanced, almost obligately gets imbalanced in a way that leads to the world situation we have and see if you agree with that.
4174000	4178000	And I'm very much curious to hear related thoughts.
4178000	4182000	So you mentioned that the primary left hemisphere value is utility.
4182000	4198000	And you also mentioned the word power, which is very important for because then civilizations have a relationship with each other that we can use social Darwinism to describe where there's a selection process defined in war and defined in population growth and things like that.
4199000	4212000	Where if a civilization has a relation, has our relationship to each other, our relationship to nature and our relationship to the sacred, all maximizing utility, right?
4212000	4221000	So we think of human resources, we think of natural resources and we think of religions as kind of narrative weapons to be able to coordinate.
4221000	4231000	Then the culture that has those utilitarian power oriented views in all those areas will win that war.
4231000	4250000	It will basically see nature as a commodity, extract more from nature to grow its population, to increase its resource consumption per capita, to grow its technological base, to utilize humans, to use the, you know, Norbert Wieners, the human use of human beings in the development of cybernetic systems.
4250000	4253000	That are then seen as inexorably in competition with each other.
4253000	4257000	So they're going to, so we have to kind of mentality.
4257000	4271000	And then there's either no sacred, there's just that which is good is that which doesn't lose, which is kind of, I think it's very interesting that game theory was developed by von Neumann at the same time we developed the bomb at the same time we developed AI.
4271000	4292000	And it was game theory and economics as kind of the height of the reductionist experiment saying based on a kind of is out distinction that you'll negate which I'm very interested in that says since philosophy of science is going to say what is and can't say what ought then our best basis for ought is that which doesn't lose in an assumed competitive
4292000	4299000	dynamic so game theory is the only thing guiding and I would argue that if your only ought is game theory.
4299000	4311000	And you have the ability for recursive technologies that turn into exponential technologies that are in an exploitative relationship with the environment which even the term environment or natural resources of crazy term.
4311000	4317000	And in arms races with each other that that civilization is self terminating.
4317000	4330000	But it's also hard to it's easy to see how it won right how it emerged that way because any civilization that oriented itself that way a little bit more was going to grow its population.
4330000	4344000	More was going to advance its tech was going to win wars and then other ones kind of had to do similarly so what the values or the sense of sacred or the connection to nature or each other that the Native Americans had before colonizers went there didn't matter that much if
4344000	4355000	weaponry and technology and whatever was not going to compete so the left hemisphere might be less intelligent in some very important ways because wisdom.
4355000	4361000	I've never actually heard anyone give a good definition of wisdom that doesn't involve restraint.
4361000	4373000	It always ends up involving restraint and binding in some ways and but the utility emphasis of the left hemisphere is very good at game theory.
4373000	4380000	And then it creates almost an obligate trajectory and then nobody wants climate change but nobody can stop it.
4380000	4382000	Nobody wants species extinction.
4382000	4388000	Nobody wants desertification but nobody can stop it the overall topological features defining our world.
4388000	4398000	Nobody wants but the game theoretic relationship between we can't price carbon properly because if the Chinese don't they'll economically be thus therefore we have to externalize the cost.
4398000	4408000	That game theoretic relationship creates a topology that is actually driving us in a self terminating direction and nobody steering because there is no sacred.
4408000	4416000	There is no we're very good at solving problems and not very good at defining is this the right problem to solve right is this the right goal to achieve.
4416000	4429000	That's actually why I was so drawn to your work is because that I wasn't thinking of it in terms of hemispheres but I was certainly thinking of it in terms of capacities and predispositions of mind.
4429000	4443000	The nature of mind that oriented to parts was very good at Techna and was very oriented to power and the power Techna thing together was going to win over the other ones and then create this kind of obligate trajectory.
4443000	4447000	I would love to hear you respond to that.
4447000	4450000	Very little in what you said that I would disagree with at all.
4450000	4455000	We're in a bind which is to nobody's benefit really.
4456000	4467000	Why we get these things wrong and we need to find a way out of this which involves restraint.
4467000	4473000	I loved what you said about that and in fact it's our lack of restraint that means that we're not wise.
4473000	4479000	It's very unwise and there are two levels to that.
4479000	4490000	There's restraint in general and self restraint and the idea of self restraint used to be intrinsic to the rise of most civilizations.
4490000	4501000	They were founded on a generation or several generations that were prepared to make sacrifices on a personal level in order to achieve something greater.
4501000	4508000	That has moved out of the picture because the value now is about our personal gain.
4508000	4516000	But sometimes if we can restrain ourselves from just pursuing personal gain we could produce an outcome which would be far more beneficial for all.
4516000	4523000	Of course this is very famously a difficult thing to achieve because some people defect from the program.
4523000	4532000	We're in a situation where we need everyone ultimately to come around to a certain way if it's a survive.
4532000	4536000	Now how can we do that? Can we do it at all?
4536000	4552000	I don't know but I believe that if enough people are committed enough and model their lives on the shift in relations with society, with nature and with the divine.
4552000	4565000	If they can reorientate their values and stop seeking fulfilment in a very simplistic and direct way which doesn't actually achieve its goal and worse is destructive.
4565000	4572000	Then we could produce an outcome that would be satisfactory. I don't know if we can achieve that.
4573000	4587000	It sounds like we'd have to convince everybody. Really if we convinced probably about 3% of the world's influential people then we might be on to something.
4587000	4598000	So I want to come back to why the world's influential people might be the psychologically least likely to be able to be convinced based on what it took to become influential.
4598000	4608000	I want to come back to that in a moment because you said maybe we only have to influence 3% but a moment before you said if we're practicing self-restraint then anyone defects.
4608000	4615000	And they don't restrain so they do the more short term power thing than they win and then they create a world that orients to that thing.
4615000	4620000	So defection, sociopathic narcissistic defection is pretty key to this thing.
4620000	4638000	I'm really curious to hear your thoughts, reflections on any of this but also specifically how do we, what are the criteria, what is the evolutionary niche for the sociopathic narcissistic property to be selected for
4638000	4649000	and how would we close that niche because promoting wisdom where it will always lose game theoretically is not that interesting.
4649000	4663000	So there's something about the relationship of wisdom and power and I would even say wisdom has to bind, it's a master emissary thing and I know this is very uncomfortable as it should be but if the master doesn't bind the emissary then everything's broken.
4663000	4671000	And so that which is power seeking has to actually be bound which requires power by something that is not power seeking in the same way.
4671000	4680000	Which is why Daoism says the one who wants to lead everybody should run away from, the one who doesn't want to lead and everyone pushes into leadership maybe you can listen to.
4680000	4690000	So curious to hear your thoughts on wisdom binding power, closing the evolutionary niche on power seeking, those types of things.
4691000	4709000	So much. Yeah, so the, I mean, I think the, I agree with, first of all, what you did was brilliant and I really appreciate it. I'm likely and I'm a very significant agreement with it.
4709000	4728000	John Keeks made a distinction between goals and ideals and the word purpose equivocates between them. A goal is an end state that everything else is in the service to and it's the utilitarian where an ideal is not an ideal is something that is part of the grammar by which you interpret and make sense of yourself in your life.
4729000	4736000	I agree. And we even did that with the sacred that we took sort of transcendent imminent and then we made this world.
4736000	4745000	This is the Nietzschean critique only had a utilitarian value for that that world. And then when we stop believing in the upper world, this world seems to have no value.
4745000	4752000	That whole framework, I think has to be rejected, which is not a rejection of the sacred. I just want to make that very, very clear.
4752000	4763000	And so why I'm, I'm, I'm sort of on that is because I think that this is part of the answer. You can break game theoretic circumstances in which, right.
4763000	4774000	You get people to remember certain things. So you can get some very core ones, like you go in a situation where you take $20. Oh, sure.
4774000	4782000	And the situation where you take $20, but here's two people, but I got to give that person 40. So they're 60 and they get 40 and you get 20. Will you take it?
4782000	4788000	And if you don't take it, nobody gets it. No, I won't take it. So people, there's a symbolic thing that they're oriented towards.
4788000	4798000	And it's something like they, they want to, they want to belong to a world that is a just world and that is more important to them than their own individual immediate gain.
4798000	4809000	That's the first thing. So there's a symbolic aspect to, and Robert Nozick made a good point about this that we, we didn't put that into a lot of and for good reasons.
4809000	4822000	We didn't put it into a lot of the game theoretic modeling because it messes up all that modeling in a lot of ways. And then that connects to we don't actually super value.
4822000	4836000	This is the sociopath, right? We will, we will, we will significantly undermine subjective well being if we have a reasonable belief that we will get enhanced meaning in life.
4836000	4849000	This is part of our evolutionary heritage as mammals, we're also primates, we're also sociocultural and the prototypical instance we do this is have a kid.
4849000	4865000	When you have a kid, all of the measures of subjective well being go down. Your health goes down, your sleeping goes down, your finances go down, your social connections go down, your amount of sleep you're getting is going down, you're sick all the time, your partner doesn't like you anymore.
4865000	4880000	And you're in a constant stress situation and you ask people, well, why are you doing this? Like, you couldn't pay most people. Well, why are you doing this? Well, because it's making my life more meaningful because they're connected to something again that has a reality beyond themselves.
4880000	4883000	Right. I'll use your term of value beyond themselves.
4883000	4886000	He used another term, interestingly, which was sacrifice.
4886000	4887000	Yes.
4887000	4889000	Which has related etymology to sacred.
4889000	4890000	Of course.
4890000	4897000	And something you can't say that you know something is sacred if you aren't willing to sacrifice for it. So please continue.
4897000	4906000	And this, and this is another thing to remember that the arrow of relevance for us does not point to just how are things relevant to me.
4906000	4918000	Yes, we do have to feel connected to ourselves because if we don't, we're dissociated or agencies undermine. But as Ian said, we have to feel fundamental, not how I'm, how are you relevant to me, but how am I relevant to you?
4918000	4929000	How am I relevant to us? And how are we relevant to the world? And yes, how is, are we and the world relevant to something that grounds that world?
4929000	4941000	What Plato would call the good, right? And so I think that if we can get people to remember, this is what I would want to say. I don't, I don't even like the word remember.
4941000	4950000	I want people to be able to fall in love with all of these dimensions of being again, because this is one of the, this was Spinoza's big insight, right?
4950000	4962000	The way you overcome a powerful motivation is what another powerful motivation is. We can get people to fall in love again with being within, between and beyond.
4962000	4971000	We can, we can, we can break the game theoretic. This is what Christianity did in the Roman Empire. Christianity went out and it didn't.
4972000	4984000	Unlike Stoicism that tried, I'm not saying we shouldn't try and get the government, but that tried, right? And it had some success too. But Christianity went and said, there's a new way for you to love yourself.
4984000	4995000	You are not the non-person the Roman Empire says you are. Here is a new way, agape is a way in which you can love yourself. And it's not a hedonistic, egocentric power.
4995000	5001000	Here's how we can love each other. And here's how we can love God.
5001000	5013000	And it captured the world. And it captured a world that was one of the epitomies of a world driven by power, competition, the lust for glory.
5013000	5023000	So we have historical examples of if you give people, if you can get them out of meaning starvation, so they're not in a scarcity mentality.
5023000	5031000	When you're a scarcity mentality, you drop into left hemispheric. I think Ian's right about that. You're short term, utilitarian, right? What do I need?
5032000	5056000	Because this is emergency mode. But if you can get people out of a scarcity mentality and get them to fall in love with being again, connecting this to themselves and others, then you can get, you can call them to something that gets them to remember that they actually do value trying to use your language, right?
5056000	5059000	Connectedness more than success.
5059000	5080000	I really like the must fall in love with, I want to play with the scarcity thing for a minute, because the people that are pursuing power the most are not in any actual economic scarcity, though they are in the perceived relative scarcity relative to the next guy competing with them.
5080000	5095000	And there are plenty of people who under scarcity share more. I've always found fascinating that when there's a disaster, either the best or the worst of people can come out. And so scarcity can go either way and abundance can go either way.
5095000	5105000	So there's something about what is sacred that is actually deeper than that even under scarcity can have someone sacrifice and that even under abundance can still have someone totally self centered.
5105000	5114000	Yes, but I did want when I was using scarcity that was talking about meaning scarcity. Yes, not economic distinction. And one of the things that happens.
5114000	5127000	For example, as people go up, the, this is an experiment, as people go up a corporate structure, and the corporate structures tend to favor people who have sociopathic tendencies.
5127000	5140000	What you also see is a measurable decrease in the ability of them to take the perspective of other individuals. Yeah, the ability to take the perspective of others individuals is strongly predictive of how many deep connections you can form in your life.
5140000	5153000	And they are actually suffering a very profound kind of scarcity as they go up there a bit there can, if you allow me to coin for their suffering connectedness scarcity in a profound way.
5153000	5164000	And, you know, what what what what I what I've been fascinated with is the number and I sure this is happening to both you, the number of people who are in these positions and positions of power, who have reached out to me and said,
5165000	5177000	I feel disconnected and there's there's that element of almost a horror and absurdity. I feel disconnected and I want like, and I want to be and I don't want it and the people I talked to in Silicon Valley, I don't want my kids to go through this.
5177000	5193000	I don't want my kids to go. And this is what I mean, there is alternative motivations to, and I think they have also an evolutionary provenance to the game theoretic motivations and I don't think the game theoretic motivations are are metaphysically necessary.
5193000	5202000	I think there are other ones that have an equal power to motive and because we have historical evidence we have current evidence that we can tap into those.
5202000	5213000	But I think there's two poles to this for us to fall in love with being again. That's that's the agent pole, but the world as an arena in which we cannot, it has to be sacred to us.
5213000	5218000	Sacred is sacred is the how the world is to us when we are falling in love with it.
5218000	5230000	I want to go into sacred. I want to say something about what you said. You said that as people move up in positions, as we look at places where power is concentrated and we move up the power hierarchy.
5230000	5240000	It is there are exceptions to this, but it is generally the case that the people who are at the top of the power hierarchies are people who are both attracted to and good at power games.
5240000	5251000	And there are certain other things that are attendant and deficient that tends to go along with that and power, whether it's economic, social or political, follows a power law distribution.
5251000	5264000	So one of the things I find very interesting is that I think there's a mistake that a lot of sociology makes where we look at certain human traits like rationality or empathy or whatever on a Gaussian distribution.
5264000	5276000	And then say humanity is the result of this where realistically the actual power influencing things says that a tiny percentage of people that are three standard deviations psychologically different than almost everyone have most of the determining power.
5276000	5285000	And then they create conditioning environments that everyone else is conditioned by. I think that's really important. We, you know, hyperagency.
5286000	5302000	I have found that, like, we had a term psychopathy and then sociopathy and now it's ASD and the DSM, anti social personality disorder, that there are types of people there that have higher and lower ability to take others perspectives.
5302000	5314000	And so there are people who have sociopathy or whatever you want to call it that have lower ability to take other people's perspectives, but there are ones that have higher cognitive empathy but lower embodied empathy.
5314000	5320000	And the higher cognitive empathy means I know how to play you and how to say what you want to hear in virtue signal.
5320000	5329000	And it's a very important point from a hemisphere point of view, because that cognitive empathy is more based on the left frontal cortex.
5329000	5331000	It's the simulation of real empathy.
5331000	5333000	Yes, exactly.
5333000	5339000	And the real empathy or the emotive empathy is more based in the right hemisphere.
5339000	5352000	But also we know that sociopaths have deficiencies in the right ventromedial frontal cortex, which is an area that's terribly important for forming any kind of emotional relationship with anybody else.
5352000	5367000	Whether this is a thing that they're born with or not is not finally concluded, but I think it pretty clearly is something that they are born with that it could be a result of a certain kind of deficient parenting.
5367000	5383000	What we're coming back to there is that, again, there is this contrast between a connected world, a relational world in which the values come out of the relations, and another kind which is a linear world of target getting, goal getting,
5383000	5389000	in which we think that what is valuable will come out of completing that goal.
5389000	5393000	And it doesn't.
5394000	5401000	I want to pick up on what you said, because I think that distinction is very important that you made.
5401000	5410000	And here, there's an ambiguity in taking a perspective. You can take a perspective in that calculative way, you said.
5410000	5417000	That's different from taking off a perspective in which you care and you try to see the world from that perspective.
5417000	5426000	This is the danger in teaching people to perspective take like the way rhetoric can do it, because you can create a very good lawyerly person.
5426000	5431000	What I've found is that people who are best at perspective seeking are either empaths or sociopaths.
5431000	5439000	They're good at perspective seeking because they really feel what other people feel and they're seeking to, or because they actually don't have any binding to anything real.
5439000	5444000	They can take whatever perspective happens of utility without caring about its relationship.
5444000	5449000	And that's the thing one has to really watch out for, is the simulation of empathy.
5449000	5453000	And it brings up something. So you were talking about Christianity binding game theory.
5453000	5461000	I'm not a Christian scholar, so I'm just going to, from the outside say, the fact that in the name of Jesus Christ who said,
5461000	5468000	let he who has no sins cast the first stone, we were able to do the Inquisitions is a really interesting act of mental gymnastics.
5468000	5479000	And so I see that wherever there is a relationship to the sacred that is authentic, and it starts to develop the ability to really move people,
5479000	5485000	there's power in that, then those who are seeking power seek to capture it, and corrupt it.
5485000	5491000	And so then all the religions become these mixed bags of an authentic beautiful thing, and the way power ends up capturing them.
5491000	5497000	And if they don't orient to power, then they usually lose in a holy war, their population doesn't become very big or something like that.
5498000	5508000	I would love to hear, because there's, how do we have a proliferation of the sacred for which someone will make real sacrifices,
5508000	5517000	and for which whole populations will, that doesn't lose to other populations that don't do that, and that doesn't get captured by power and perverted and distorted?
5517000	5521000	Right. Okay. So first of all, agreed.
5521000	5526000	But I want to, I want to, I want to say,
5526000	5529000	Well, the notion of restraint.
5529000	5540000	Christianity was successful in pretty much keeping it as part of the cultural cognitive grammar that people other than the male citizens were actually persons.
5540000	5547000	It was successful at turning infanticide into an accepted practice into something we find horrific.
5547000	5553000	So, yes, I'm not saying that, you know, the power structures came in.
5553000	5571000	But there were, there was also enough, I mean, we, we are running on the fumes of the Christian sacred canopy, and it's been what has been still keeping some restraints on this otherwise Milwaukee and machine that's running.
5571000	5577000	And I want to, what I'm trying to say is,
5577000	5586000	I want to, I want to, I want to give us a sense of hope about this, that it's not the sacred emerges, and then it gets consumed.
5586000	5594000	The sacred emerges, there is the, there is the pushback, there's the reframing, there's the power consumption.
5594000	5599000	But some of the underlying cultural cognitive grammar has been fundamentally changed.
5599000	5601000	We haven't gone back to the Bronze Age.
5601000	5605000	We're still post-Axio, we haven't gone back to the pre-Christian age.
5605000	5607000	We're, right, that that's not what happened.
5607000	5614000	And so I'm saying, I'm not denying that, right, I'm not denying that there's the threat.
5614000	5632000	Well, what I'm saying is, but if we could be more clear about what gets preserved across the, I don't know what they're calling the re-entrenchment of the power dynamics, and could we better, more better this time, focus our attention there,
5632000	5640000	focus our cultural and even our political commitments, we could perhaps do it better this time.
5640000	5655000	I mean, I think we must, this exactly brings up a question I wanted to ask you is, in the parable that you told of the master and the emissary, I might argue that the responsibility for the failure of that civilization or tribe,
5655000	5657000	or whatever you want to call it, was the masters, not the emissaries.
5657000	5659000	Because the master obviously misassessed.
5659000	5661000	The master would probably have agreed with you.
5661000	5662000	Yes.
5662000	5677000	And so, rather than say the master was wise and the emissary wasn't, so he did a Dunning-Kruger thing and messed it all up, the master was missing a certain kind of wisdom in his assessment of the actual realistic capabilities of the emissary.
5677000	5684000	There was some stuff in his noticing the whole that he wasn't noticing that was really critical for him to ultimately still hold responsibility.
5684000	5689000	So there's an uptick in the master capability that could have kept that relationship right.
5689000	5690000	Yes.
5690000	5700000	So there's something about needing to be power literate, to be able to keep power from corrupting a relationship with the sacred.
5700000	5714000	I mean, rather than say that the master was deficient in some way, one would say that there was an important relationship here which required a certain degree of vulnerability.
5714000	5726000	So the master couldn't remain invulnerable because he realized that he needed to not concern himself with certain things, if things were to survive.
5726000	5730000	So there isn't a squeaky clean answer to this.
5730000	5732000	He had in a way to trust.
5732000	5741000	In some ways it's very like the story of God and Satan, that Satan was Lucifer, the lightbringer, the brightest of the angels, God's right hand.
5741000	5748000	And because of his power hungriness and his envy of God, everything fell to ruin.
5748000	5755000	But at the end of that story isn't ruined because Christianity, again, I'm becoming more and more convinced during our conversation.
5755000	5765000	If nothing else comes out of it, how very, very important the sort of overarching effect of a religion such as Christianity is for the survival of a civilization.
5765000	5769000	I mean, I've always felt that, but I see it more and more in what we're talking about.
5769000	5778000	And what you've adverted to earlier was the necessary sort of supervision.
5778000	5785000	And that is a difficult balancing act as it is for the master and the emissary.
5785000	5794000	And there's another fable which I tell at the beginning of part three of the math of it things, which is an Onondaga legend.
5795000	5805000	And they have the story of how, you know, because creation was waning, there were these two brothers who were sent to sort of regenerate the power of the universe.
5805000	5810000	And these brothers are not equal, like the master and the emissary.
5810000	5815000	One of them is wise and he is called the one that holds the earth with both hands.
5815000	5820000	The other is called hard as ice, the flint.
5820000	5827000	And his value is that he's got a tool that his father gave him, which is speech.
5827000	5831000	And the other is an arrow with which he can shoot.
5831000	5838000	And this is an extraordinary, just starting there, division between, as it were, the writer has left out a bit.
5838000	5841000	But the story gets better and better as it goes on.
5841000	5849000	I can't tell the whole thing, but those are interested in recording on YouTube of me reading the introduction of this chapter in which we tell the story.
5850000	5858000	But effectively what the good brother realizes is the bad brother tries to imitate the good brother, because he's envious of him.
5858000	5863000	He sees the good brother creating all kinds of wonderful things, birds and beasts and flowers.
5863000	5868000	And he tries to create and he produces only thorns and flies and bats.
5868000	5874000	And there's a sort of sense that he is dangerous left to himself.
5874000	5884000	But he must also not come too close to the good brother, because the good brother needs to preserve a degree of his independence without which he is no longer himself.
5884000	5890000	So they can't fuse, but one needs to be subservient to the other, the one needs to have power over the other.
5890000	5894000	But that is not something that can ever be secured 100%.
5894000	5895000	Right.
5895000	5900000	So you could never have the situation where the one that is wise has that power,
5900000	5905000	because one of the terms on which wisdom exists is that it sees beyond power.
5905000	5914000	Now, I know that you've made a very good point that there needs to be a certain degree of sort of watchfulness and awareness.
5914000	5915000	I agree about that.
5915000	5921000	But quite how this is managed in a way that doesn't actually appreciate the whole business of wisdom,
5921000	5928000	because in most cultures wisdom is associated with, well, in Chinese with Wu Wei, within action.
5928000	5932000	The master does nothing, but nothing is left undone.
5932000	5937000	These remarkable and beautiful sayings of the Taoist literature.
5937000	5943000	So we have to somehow find a way of making that work.
5943000	5947000	And I don't know what your ideas about how that could be made to work are.
5947000	5952000	A close friend and colleague of mine that you both know, Zach Stein,
5952000	5963000	talks about the distinction between power differentials in educational setting versus in most traditional power settings.
5963000	5969000	Specifically, he's talking about educative authority versus propaganda in terms of information asymmetries.
5969000	5978000	And that the key distinction, and this gets fuzzy, but the key distinction is that someone who has information asymmetry relative to someone else
5978000	5985000	who could use that asymmetry to maintain the asymmetry and grow it, which is the impulse of power traditionally.
5985000	5991000	In the educative example, the educator recognizes that they have an information asymmetry,
5991000	5998000	but they're in a kind of fiduciary relationship where their goal is to actually bring the student up to symmetry with them and even beyond.
5998000	6001000	So their goal is not to maintain their power asymmetry.
6001000	6005000	They use the power asymmetry to close it.
6005000	6014000	And whereas in most power dynamics, if someone has an economic asymmetry, they use that increased economic power, political power to both maintain it and grow it.
6014000	6021000	And so we would say the first one is an ethically legitimate utilization of the reality of a power differential.
6021000	6024000	The second one is not a legitimate one.
6024000	6035000	But what that also means is let's say that the educator who's trying to bring this person up to competence recognizes that there's someone else who's trying to exploit them.
6035000	6043000	The educator now has some ethical responsibility in their fiduciary responsibility to the student to also do something over here, to do something in that relationship.
6043000	6053000	And that is where I think it's very interesting is if those who are pursuing the true, the good and the beautiful,
6053000	6061000	those who are pursuing a deep relationship with the sacred and wisdom don't do anything,
6061000	6069000	and don't develop any levers of technological or economic or other types of power, low deceiving, so to speak,
6069000	6077000	then they're leading the direction of the world to those who maximally seek power orientation for the illegitimate use.
6077000	6083000	And so then you have to say, is it really wise to say I seed power of the world to the sociopaths,
6083000	6089000	including in the risk of eminent extinction and the destruction of the sacred and not just the future destruction,
6089000	6093000	but that 10 to 20 animals go extinct every day from human action,
6093000	6101000	that there are two orders of magnitude, more mammals and factory farms and in the wild today.
6101000	6108000	There's some ethical obligation of those who give a shit about that to have that give a shit do something, to be actual, as you say,
6108000	6115000	actual meaning that it acts. So are our values actual? If they're actual, do they have a causal effect?
6115000	6118000	Yeah. Well, are they obligated to?
6118000	6128000	I mean, if I may just respond to that. I'm not suggesting that we just sit back and roll over and let everything go to hell in a hand cut.
6128000	6139000	That's very far from what I'm saying. But what I'm saying is that even if we were to find ways of reducing certain kinds of harm,
6139000	6147000	unless they were accompanied by a growth in wisdom, that really wouldn't achieve what we need to achieve.
6147000	6153000	We would leave the psychopaths in charge, actually. So it is a difficult one.
6153000	6160000	I mean, your analogy is not meant to be perfect, but for example, with the teacher bringing the pupil up to his standard and maybe beyond,
6160000	6170000	which I like that idea, and I think it's a real one. But if the student is, in fact, basically psychopathic,
6170000	6179000	then has he done good by doing that? I mean, once you start looking at the outcomes of actions rather than the motivations behind actions,
6179000	6184000	you get famously into trouble.
6184000	6194000	There's three things I want to respond to. One is I'm hearing, we've been talking a lot about the master versus the emissary,
6194000	6201000	but it seems to me that we're in a weird problematic here. And I know this isn't an accurate representation of your thought,
6201000	6206000	but I want to pose it. But I want to also state all three things because they belong together.
6206000	6213000	One is, yeah, but that also requires that the left hemisphere has some reverence for the right hemisphere,
6213000	6221000	but reverence is probably a property of the right hemisphere. And so you've got this weird catch-22 thing going on.
6221000	6231000	And then I think part of how we have done this, and this is why I'm bringing up the educator, is important, is we've done this by saying,
6231000	6238000	there's another variable in here, which is there's not only individual cognition, there's the collective intelligence of distributed cognition.
6238000	6249000	There's something that comes out in a week, like what's here, that doesn't belong to you or to me, but it takes on a life of its own.
6249000	6256000	And of course, this is the whole tradition of the Ecclesia and the tradition of the geist and the tradition of the logos.
6256000	6265000	And the Socratic Dialogue, we follow the logos wherever it goes. And what that does is, this is Plato's pivot problem.
6265000	6273000	Because the example you're talking about is exactly the problem that Plato was wrestling with with Socrates and Elcibiades.
6273000	6280000	Here you have the most attractive, not physically, but the most attractive representation of wisdom.
6280000	6289000	And here you have this, you know, glorious figure who is attracted to Socrates, but is ultimately, properly, you know, a psychopath, Elcibiades,
6289000	6299000	is willing to screw anybody over for his own personal work and betray everybody. And Plato really is vexed about how, why doesn't he turn?
6299000	6306000	What makes somebody pivot towards that? And then Plato wrestles with this and he has sort of two answers.
6306000	6322000	One is, there's a sort of seduction, and I hate to use that term in our charged atmosphere, but there's a seduction, which is, you basically get sort of the left hemisphere really involved with the kind of stuff it likes to do,
6322000	6333000	running arguments and discussions. But as it's doing that, you use that as a way of getting it to pay attention to the non propositional, right, in very, very powerful ways.
6333000	6343000	And this is why Plato writes dialogues, because the drama and the character development are as important as the argument. We did a great disservice that we just took the arguments out and stuck them over.
6343000	6352000	All right. But if you do that, that's that that that's part of the answer. And then in that, what what part of the seduction is.
6352000	6358000	And it's not, like, if you try to make somebody follow the sacred, it's not sacred. Right.
6358000	6379000	The seduction is like, again, how, how we fall in love, right, is if you put people into these circumstances where they can catch the fire of the logos, then they will often feel called to reorient themselves.
6379000	6390000	They will do the Plato's pivot. It's not an algorithm, because it was an algorithm, it wouldn't be the thing we need. We can't make it an algorithm and we're looking for something algorithmic where we're fundamentally
6390000	6403000	misapprehending the ontology that has to be at its basis. But I've seen this when we do these dialogical practices, people say, and this is regardless of where they come from, religious or secular, they're saying,
6403000	6416000	this is a kind of intimacy I've always been looking for, but I didn't realize it sounds like platonic and amnesis, right. And then and then if they go longer, right, they start to they start to move beyond the intimacy between they say,
6416000	6432000	there's the we space or the guys or the logos and they start to feel intimate with and then they're called to that. And then some people are called beyond that they're called to through all of that I get a sense of intimacy with being itself and they get the possibility of falling in love again.
6432000	6450000	But I can't argue them. I can put them into a place where there's orientation going on, where there's conceptual reflection going on. But this thing, we have to structure it with a lot of finesse, so it takes on a life of its own, and can draw us in so we can get people to do the platonic pivot.
6450000	6459000	That's, that's how I would address what logic has this compulsory kind of nature, if you like that it's trying to compel a position.
6459000	6466000	Yes. And what you rightly are pointing out is that the things that really matter like wisdom and love can't be compelled in this way.
6466000	6474000	No. And if they are there, no longer wisdom or love. There was always a vulnerability involved here. That's terribly important in my view.
6474000	6487000	And it's not necessarily anybody's fault if that vulnerability leads as it usually does eventually to some kind of a downfall. But without actually taking the risk, we can't have the great things that we have had.
6487000	6497000	So it has its own value and purpose, even if we can't actually always guarantee what kind of an outcome there's going to be.
6497000	6506000	Okay, but I want to pick up on the seduction. I agree with what you're saying. But what I want to say is, can we get, I'm trying to use your language because I want to play with you.
6506000	6516000	Can we get the left hemisphere involved with speech and logic, and it likes to play this. This is what happens. But it gets drawn, it gets drawn into something that is beyond itself.
6516000	6530000	It does. And that takes me back to a point you made early on that how can it ever be that the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere have that right relationship because the left hemisphere has this intrinsic loss of reverence or whatever.
6530000	6540000	But I don't think that's necessarily the case because I think the problem comes when we give too much power to the emissary in that myth.
6540000	6551000	So to begin with in civilisation, the left hemisphere and right hemisphere work very well together. The left hemisphere is given exactly that kind of a job that it's good at.
6551000	6559000	And if you like to put it this way, I'm being ridiculous at the anthropomorphic, but it's happy to be in that role and to contribute.
6559000	6568000	But the problem comes when we start to lose, I'm going to come back to this thing about the value difference between the right and left.
6568000	6575000	I think it's absolutely essential to the situation we're in. It's our complete loss of orientation towards the right values.
6576000	6592000	And what happens then is that the values of the left hemisphere are encouraged and the left hemisphere starts to see only its own point of view and it thinks itself in a Dunning-Kruger-like way to be more intelligent than it is.
6592000	6599000	Okay, and I agree with this wholeheartedly, but I want to say something that overlaps with Daniel, what he's saying.
6599000	6609000	Because one of the things that the Enlightenment, why it takes off, I would argue, is it gets a way of really clarifying the difference between authority and power.
6609000	6617000	And this is one of the things, you know, so you've got Kant, and then I want to correct it with Hegel, but Kant is basically saying, I know,
6617000	6628000	authority is when I recognize you as being able to say something that I will fundamentally be persuaded of as true.
6628000	6635000	So I recognize that you are, you know, this is a Kantian model, his language is dangerous, but just let me use it for now.
6635000	6644000	I recognize you as a rational being, and therefore I should acknowledge that what you say, I should take it seriously and allow it to possibly persuade me.
6644000	6652000	And then when I do something because you have persuaded me, I do it because I have recognized you and you have recognized me.
6652000	6663000	And then Hegel said, oh, but this reciprocal recognition, which is what you get in the student and the teacher that you don't get in, because the master sleigh, this is Hegel,
6663000	6667000	you don't have reciprocal recognition, right?
6667000	6671000	And importantly, that is not the relationship between the hemispheres I talk about that.
6671000	6682000	Exactly, exactly. And this is exactly so one of the things I think the one of the things why the Enlightenment takes office because it brought this tremendous liberating clarification about wait, wait, wait.
6682000	6697000	We want, we want, we want all the governance, even myself governance to be based on authority, which is based on reciprocal recognition and Hegel says not only moment to moment, but all of the people before you, and all the people that are going to come after you,
6697000	6708000	the biggest possible distributed cognition machine you have, you want, you want to be like listening to them and you want to be trying to get the future to listen to you and you get this tremendous model of authority.
6708000	6724000	And I think that was tremendously liberating. Now, the, the, and then what I see happening is that some of the things that came along with that is how the, the right hemisphere started to seed power or not realize that power is getting seeded.
6724000	6743000	Because once you give, right, this, this priority to this, right, then you start to give a, it's very easy to get into the idea, oh, but all the, all that the reasoning is all of the, all that the rationality is it's not a way of being, it's just a way of calculating
6744000	6757000	Hobbes proposes this, right. So, right, the enlightenment gives us something that is tremendously of value and I don't, I don't think we want to go back to and give that back again. We don't want to go back to master slide.
6758000	6773000	And so we have to get to that, that, that point where no, no, no reason isn't about calculation, it's about being with each other in a way that we are reciprocally responsible to each other.
6773000	6776000	So we are governed by authority rather than by power.
6777000	6798000	That's, I'm trying to answer you that that is, that is possible for us. There was two things in the enlightenment that got inappropriately bound together. I think the very legitimate understanding of the difference between authority and power, and then the illegitimate reduction of rationality, not as a way of being with each other, but as a way of calculating each other's behavior.
6798000	6822000	Which is, in my terms, the handing over of reason to mere rationality, rationality being schematic logic as a way of understanding things, whereas the reason is a way of balancing rationality with the intuitions that come from a life where we live from experience.
6822000	6832000	And that is what is reason. It was always thought to be the main purpose of an education for 2000 years in the West to produce a reasonable person.
6832000	6833000	Yes.
6833000	6838000	And that's what one would expect of a wise judge or a good politician, but we don't have that.
6838000	6848000	Right. So my language for that, and I don't think it's in any way different. I talk about the ancient notion of logos and with Descartes, you get it reduced to logic.
6848000	6860000	And then we reduce reason to just logical manipulation of propositions. And we lose all the other. We lose the perspectival and the participatory notions.
6860000	6870000	So you said something at the beginning I want to come back to, which is how can the left brain have reverence for the right if it doesn't have reverence as a capability?
6870000	6871000	Yes.
6871000	6883000	And I think this is something I said to Ian when he and I had a brief visit yesterday is what Gertl did with the incompleteness theorem was use math to show the upper boundaries of math.
6883000	6884000	Sure.
6884000	6891000	But that's the Socratic project. That's what Socrates does, almost all of the dialogues end in a poria, for that reason.
6891000	6895000	And it's what the Guyanayog path and the Vedic tradition did.
6895000	6897000	Exactly, of Poans in Zen.
6897000	6908000	It's what Tarski did with formal logic, using formal logic to show the upper bounds. And I think it's exactly what Ian is doing in describing the master emissary relationship in a way the left brain can understand.
6908000	6918000	Because, you know, I was saying earlier, wouldn't the master be the more responsible party? I think they're both responsible, right? And so there is a reverence the left hemisphere has to have for the right.
6918000	6926000	There is a recognition of the developmental maturity capacity and relationship with the environment the right needs to have, right?
6926000	6934000	And we're of course using left and right hemisphere than the individual to also represent forces in the world, distribution of people and like that.
6934000	6949000	And I think the very best thing that the parts based, one of the best things the parts based mind can do is recognize its own upper boundaries being insufficient to what is actually worth caring about.
6949000	6957000	In which case, it has its own kind of transcendence, right? It has its own recognition of something beyond itself worth listening to.
6957000	6971000	So, again, evolutionary provenance for this, right? I think one way I would say of Ian's histiography is like the what should be properly opponent processing and I'll explain what I mean by that has become adversarial processing.
6971000	6987000	And this is also the problem at the level of our distributed cognition. If you look throughout our biology, you have opponent processing going on opponent processing is when you have two systems that have complimentary biases, and then you lock them together so that each is the best
6987000	6998000	the best corrector of the other. So, non controversial example is the autonomic nervous system. You have the sympathetic system biased in one way that views everything as a threat and opportunity.
6998000	7009000	The parasympathetic is everything is right. And they're like this. And so your level of arousal is constantly evolving and there's doesn't have to be any king or emperor over this, because it is a self correcting system.
7009000	7022000	Your attentional system, the task focused default, you're constantly moving between focusing your attention and varying opponent processing opponent processing between foregrounding and backgrounding and I can go on and on.
7022000	7034000	Why does nature keep coming to this because it is how you solve the no free lunch there every heuristic has a complimentary bias. This is a mathematical theorem or proof.
7034000	7046000	But, and this is one of the things I put in my original 2012 paper, but if you put two complimentary heuristics together, they can toggle between each other, and you don't fall prey to the no free lunch.
7046000	7061000	You can escape the trap that you have to constantly fall into the bias from your heuristic nature figured this out. And I think I would put it to you if we understand it the way I've explained it to you that the proper relationship between the
7061000	7078000	left hemisphere could be opponent processing, rather than adversarial processing, if each hemisphere could come to see the other hemisphere as a valuable source of self correction, because as you say they solve different sets of problems well defined
7078000	7088000	problems left hemisphere, very ill defined gestaltish problems in the right hemisphere. And but this is also something not at the individual level democracy history.
7088000	7105000	Democracy requires this commitment, which is not game theory, but it is has evolutionary provenance, you are the best possible entity for me overcoming my self deceptive bias because you have alternative biases, and I am the best for you.
7105000	7118000	And if we both commit to the guys the logos between us, we can get the best self correcting system, which is what democracy is supposed to be but not just for individual cognition, it's supposed to be for cognition, distributed cognition.
7118000	7130000	But again, I'm trying to offer you the theme you have that I keep wanting to answer is there's evolutionary providence for the alternatives that are being discussed here that can be tapped into.
7130000	7159000	Yes, I want to propose something in relationship to this in here, both your thoughts. One very simple way I would sometimes describe the generator of the metacrisis is that humans have radically beyond evolutionary capability via technology development and still using relatively close to evolutionary motivations.
7159000	7172000	That you can't apply apex predator theory to sapiens and have a biosphere that doesn't self destruct, because a polar bear can't make nukes, and an orca can't kill all the fish in the ocean, but we can do both.
7172000	7188000	And so we're obviously not an apex predator, we're, we obviously are something well beyond that, because the evolutionary process, having most of the adaptive capacity and the other animals be corporeal and very slow evolving and slow evolving through processes that create co selection.
7188000	7197000	Creates a symmetry of power, whereas the orca gets faster sort of the tune and they get away and as the polar bear gets faster, the walruses get bigger and all that kind of thing.
7197000	7213000	And with the complexification of our cognitive processes that could start to do technique and I would say, I'm just going to call it technique in general, both physical technologies and language, capitalism, etc.
7213000	7225000	That our adaptive capacity and our predate of capacity increased rapidly faster than any of the rest of the environment, increased its resilience or relative capacity.
7225000	7232000	And so I would put the origin of the metacrisis not with evolutionary processes, but with the beginning of stone tools, right.
7232000	7236000	And it's stone tools were pretty slow evolutionary curve.
7236000	7240000	And so then with the agricultural revolution, we got a big bump.
7240000	7253000	And then the industrial we get a big bump. I think we get a big bump in the upper pillar of the transition and that's my response to, which is we get a big bump in the upper pillar of the transition in which we seem to get the advent of the appreciation of the sacred that goes along.
7253000	7267000	It is so into some of our biggest cognitive, cognitive advancements. So you have the technology like you said is like this, right. And then we get this bump, and we get projectile weapons, we get calendars.
7267000	7274000	We get, but we also get music. We also get representational art. We've seen it.
7274000	7279000	Here, here's my argument actually it's a you're, you're making it.
7279000	7296000	Okay, humans have been a very mixed bag in from a ethical perspective of the only creature that really scientifically optimized tortured of the most subjective suffering possible, but also the only one that will sacrifice itself for other species and that can make the
7296000	7307000	value of the Bodhisattva, right. Our abstraction allowed us to search a very wide search space. So the most kind of beautiful, numerous stuff and the most kind of horrific stuff.
7307000	7317000	What I'm arguing is that that mixed bag that we have been with exponential tech near planetary boundaries self terminates, and that we don't get to keep being that mixed bag.
7317000	7330000	And this now comes up to the vulnerability of if the relationship to the sacred is forced or compulsory, it's not actually a relationship to the sacred. If you remove choice, it's not ethics anymore, it's mechanism.
7330000	7336000	And so there's a vulnerability in the recognition of actual choice and in the honoring of choice.
7336000	7344000	But we have to do that and fundamentally differently than we've ever done because if you say how well have we stewarded our power historically.
7344000	7356000	If you ask the other species that we inhabited the planet with or the lower classes within civilizations or whatever, that mixed bag stewarded it pretty poorly in many places.
7356000	7371000	But we couldn't split atoms, and we couldn't change genomes and we couldn't make AI. So the question comes. And so let's take AI for a moment because splitting atoms takes
7372000	7384000	G8 nation state level capacity to do it actually does and the G8 has made sure nobody else gets to use it through the AI and making sure that if anyone even tries to bomb them preemptively because we don't want the power to get distributed.
7384000	7394000	And yet we're distributing the power of synthetic bio and AI rapidly that is every bit is destructive to not just other state actors but anybody in a way that is unmonitorable.
7394000	7411000	So when you have decentralized catastrophe weapons and things that can create the catastrophe even by the intentionally good use but with mistaken externalities from doing too much narrow problem solving and not enough is this a good goal is this the right problem orientation.
7411000	7417000	And anybody does the AI weapon everybody has to do the AI weapon or they lose by default those types of dynamics.
7417000	7432000	And I would argue that that our abstraction capacity exploring that whole search base, the power sides of it end up and you know, Robert writes non zero.
7432000	7443000	Of course you have in you have a selection for increased coordination within an in group that can do sometimes coordination with an out group that we call trade but sometimes zero some more negative some competition within out group.
7443000	7453000	And there's a shelling game where I'll coordinate with you when it's in my benefit while reserving the right to defect on you and that's in our benefit and if anybody does that then everybody's in that kind of game theory.
7453000	7462000	And if someone says well we'll just sacrifice ourselves comprehensively great and there's just no more of those people those people are gone and the people who made it through the people who won the game theory thing.
7462000	7475000	What I'm saying is that both through conflict theory people who want to do messed up stuff with this much technological power and through mistake theory people who are just, I don't want to cause climate change but I want to do stuff that requires energy,
7475000	7480000	multiplied by the content imperative of there's a billion people all wanting to do the same thing.
7480000	7490000	We go extinct in all those scenarios or we at least radically lose civilization any definition of civilizational progress anybody could want to argue I would already say when you talk about the enlightenment.
7490000	7501000	If you ask how was the enlightenment and how was civilizational how is generally the narrative of civilizational progress to the Native Americans, or to any of the indigenous species that works, you know, indigenous people that were
7501000	7507000	extinct or any of the other species or whatever the progress narrative is a very challenging narrative.
7507000	7512000	And I'm not going to throw out all of the baby with the bathwater but we have to hold the complexity of it.
7513000	7528000	The question that I'm really curious about is, given the amount of technological power that we have and that we're rapidly getting, and given how much that power has already eroded the biosphere to the point of tipping points,
7528000	7535000	and given how distributed all the people are and there is no one king of the world I'm not saying we would want it, who can make choices.
7535000	7543000	Can we imagine a humanity that has the wisdom to steward that power, reasonably well.
7543000	7552000	Well, here's my here's my challenge back to you, because you've made this argument before and I find it compelling but I also find it frustrating, because the argument is set up.
7552000	7568000	It basically says, we have no examples from the past that we can rely on, and then asked us to imagine the future, where, how can we possibly imagine the future without relying on the past examples.
7568000	7572000	It's a request to do, and I know you're not trying to do that.
7573000	7589000	I would argue that we have examples from the past temporarily that were able to use restraint via wisdom, via relationship to the sacred, adequate to have their own population and some relative sustainability with its environment and some reasonable quality of life producing.
7590000	7602000	I have indigenous scholar friends who've said that the early indigenous wisdom traditions, we're talking 40,000 years ago, actually emerged in relationship with human extinction of megafauna.
7602000	7610000	And that they had already messed up and were like, whoa, we're too powerful to be this dumb, we have to be a lot wiser, men are not the web of life, we're a strand within it, whatever we do to the web we do to ourselves,
7610000	7615000	that the first wisdom traditions were already their response to the anthropogenic crisis.
7615000	7627000	And so then they might have had a while of relatively good binding of that level of tech, then someone else got a higher level of tech, didn't have the same binding, and then those people got wiped out or had to join the thing.
7627000	7633000	So I'm not saying we have no precedent of people doing a wisdom binding power thing.
7633000	7639000	I'm saying we have no adequate precedent to the current situation, because obviously we have a totally different power dynamic.
7640000	7645000	But it's okay to say that new stuff is required, right?
7645000	7647000	So this is an innovative question.
7647000	7654000	It's an innovating in the domain of wisdom question that, of course, draws on but is not limited to what we have done so far.
7654000	7657000	So to my ear, this just sounds like an exactive proposal.
7657000	7661000	Can we take stuff totally that's been working one way and repurpose it?
7661000	7664000	Like the way the tongue has been repurposed for speech.
7664000	7666000	Am I understanding you correctly?
7667000	7669000	Because sometimes I've heard...
7669000	7670000	It has to be exactive.
7670000	7671000	Right, okay.
7671000	7672000	So it is...
7672000	7675000	I don't think we were evolutionarily selected to wisely steward AI.
7675000	7677000	No, I don't think anyone would argue that.
7677000	7682000	So we were evolutionarily selected to have hemispheres that do this stuff, and it created...
7682000	7687000	In the same way, I don't think we were evolutionarily selected to cause the Anthropocene and all of the problems and cause climate change.
7687000	7688000	Right.
7688000	7693000	So I think the problems and the solutions are both exactive to the evolutionary capacities.
7693000	7694000	Right, okay.
7694000	7695000	Excellent.
7695000	7696000	Okay.
7696000	7711000	So the question is, how much hope can be placed in the sapiential, the wise oriented acceptations, compared to, like, let's call them the power dynamic acceptations, the technological power dynamic acceptations.
7711000	7714000	And it's difficult to know where we...
7714000	7715000	I'm not trying to be difficult.
7715000	7720000	I'm just trying to say, for me, it's like, where would we stand to ask that question?
7720000	7724000	Like what would be the place in which you see us being able to...
7724000	7731000	Like where are we standing such that we can look at these two and say, I can make sort of...
7731000	7740000	I don't want to say objective, but a relatively neutral evaluation of these two and say, here's how we can place hope here.
7740000	7742000	Because you're not just asking people to place hope.
7742000	7745000	I hear you saying, can you give me good reason to place hope?
7745000	7747000	Is that fair?
7747000	7748000	I think...
7748000	7763000	So, you know, my process coming to this with regard to global catastrophic risk obviously involved recognizing none of the other species were causing global catastrophic risk and people with stone tools couldn't cause global catastrophic risk and people with bronze tools couldn't.
7763000	7773000	So it was a relationship to human mind, our mind's ability to create vast economic, industrial communication, educational governments, technological systems.
7773000	7784000	The way those systems in turn reinforce patterns of mind, they lead us to a novel situation of self-induced global catastrophic risk that is increasingly eminent.
7784000	7795000	And then saying, what do all these different risks have in common in terms of the patterns of human experience and behavior, individually and collectively, particularly collectively, that give rise to them?
7795000	7805000	Because if we can identify those generative dynamics, then we can say a future that is not described by these catastrophes has to deal with these generative dynamics.
7805000	7815000	And so we talk about the third attractor of like neither a future defined by increasing catastrophe nor a control response to that that gives dystopias what's left.
7815000	7825000	And so really it's a what are the necessary criteria of a civilization that could steward the amount of technological power we have well.
7825000	7833000	So then this is great. This is helpful. I think Ian and I have been trying to point out what some of those underlying generative dynamics are.
7833000	7834000	Exactly.
7835000	7841000	And I don't mean to put words in your mouth. So if I say something inappropriate, please intervene.
7841000	7858000	But proposed, you know, these ideas of wisdom, correct interest, cerebral, intra psychic relation, correct distributed cognition, replacing adversarial with opponent, bringing back love of virtue, love of the transcendentals,
7858000	7868000	just every fairy, they have an evolutionary provenance so we can depend on deep motivations to empower them. But I sense that you're still sensing an inadequacy in this.
7868000	7871000	Well, I think at an individual level, these are good thoughts.
7871000	7872000	Right.
7872000	7885000	At the, how do you have those define the way AI is developed and rolled out and the way synthetic biology is developed and rolled out and the way that NATO and Russia engage over Ukraine is different.
7885000	7900000	So one is saying, what would more why, like, is there a basis? There's a philosophical questions. Is there a basis in reality for intrinsic purpose or meaningfulness or sacred?
7900000	7908000	Is there, are there different capacities, maybe hemispheric orientations within humans to understand that better?
7909000	7920000	IE, are there ways of developing wisdom that could steward power better? That's like the philosophic and then developmental at the individual level.
7920000	7932000	But then it's the, you pointed out the word defection earlier, right, which is the defection from the wisdom that is directing the power that can end up leading to these kind of slippery things.
7932000	7940000	You can never totally close that. But in the time of stone tools or bronze tools, the worst thing it could do was way less bad than the worst thing it can do now.
7940000	7958000	So I'm asking for better thoughts on what would it take to develop wisdom at the scale necessary to actually have a human, a continuing human presence on the planet that doesn't destroy itself or totally suck.
7958000	7977000	I've offered an answer to that, I thought. Okay. But my proposal is we need to basically co-opt and exact the machinery of religion because religions have been able to do, they've shown that they are proper distributed
7977000	7987000	indigenous and collective intelligent machines that can fundamentally reorient at a civilizational level. They can do that for good or for ill.
7987000	8000000	And that what we need is something like that, and I'm not proposing that I'm going to start a religion because that's a ridiculous proposal, but I'm saying we have done this in the past.
8000000	8018000	Yeah. And of course, nobody makes a religion. There's an algorithm. There's a way in which I'm sort of high to Gary about that. The sacred has to somehow break through the way the complicated has failed in the face of the complexity of reality, and speaks in a new way, and something is called to that.
8018000	8031000	And then we have something like, but it can't be like the axial religions. It has to be as different to the axial religions as the axial religions were to the Bronze Age religions. This is the proposal I'm making.
8031000	8041000	Okay, great. So this relates to what Ian said a few moments ago when he said, if I'm getting anything out of this conversation, it's how powerful something like Christianity must be.
8041000	8061000	So you were speaking to this hierarchy of values and the utility values at the bottom, which obviously is not how the world is oriented currently, and some sense of the sacred at the top.
8061000	8075000	We mentioned wisdom being something that has a concept of restraint bound so that utility is not always maximized, that power is not always maximized in service of something that is other than utility.
8075000	8076000	Absolutely.
8076000	8086000	You're proposing that religion has served this function before, and that something like that is probably needed.
8086000	8099000	What, obviously, we know the history of why church and state have been separated. We know all of the critiques of religion that are worthwhile.
8099000	8117000	What do we imagine the relationship to some sense of sacred that is developable, that creates something like wisdom, that creates something like restraint and power binding, that creates something like increased felt meaningfulness,
8118000	8124000	increased sense of coordination that is other than game theory.
8124000	8145000	What might that look like, because it probably won't be just religion as its own domain, it'll probably be how it relates to the educational system, and to media, and even how it's encoded in economics, and what are some of your thoughts on what the criteria of such religion might need to be,
8145000	8154000	and what it might look like, and what the transition from here to there or its development might look like.
8154000	8167000	So I really want to be really clear that I am not proposing the founding of a religion or anything ridiculous like this, because relevance is not subjective.
8167000	8180000	It has to be co-created by reality, and thus, religion has to be co-created by reality. There's a sense in which reality has to disclose something to us, so I just want to reiterate that contextualization.
8180000	8185000	Now within that, what I've been trying to do are two related projects.
8186000	8201000	One is to try and look for what can be exacted from the past, and I want to use that language very carefully, and see some of the central things that come out of that.
8202000	8207000	These are both very long arguments, so it'll be very compressed.
8207000	8218000	One is, you take a look at what becomes pretty much the spiritual backbone of the West, and Arthur V. Lewis I think has argued this very well, which is something like Neoplatonism.
8218000	8233000	Neoplatonism has this tremendous capacity to enter into reciprocal reconstruction with Judaism, with Christianity, with Islam, with science. It does this at the beginning of the science.
8233000	8252000	So it has this tremendous thing, and I think Filler, in his wonderful book, in his series of essays, has made a very clear case, a very good case, that what Neoplatonism is trying to get us to do is give up a substance-based ontology.
8252000	8271000	And I mean substance, not just in the Cartesian sense, but the Aristotelian sense, that we think of the world. The most real things are spatio-temporal physical things to which properties bind, and that relations emerge out of these things.
8271000	8286000	And that what Neoplatonism is trying to say is, no, reality is ultimately about intelligibility, or we can use something analogous from our modern thinking. We have to play with it, though, information, and this is inherently relational.
8286000	8309000	Intelligibility, information are inherently relational, and so reality is fundamentally, primarily relational, but it takes a lot of transformation of individuals for to get them into seeing the ground of being as that the relations have ontological.
8309000	8328000	Don't think about this temporally, because that's a mistake, but they have ontological priority over the velata, the things that are bound in to the relations. And that way you can ground intelligibility and information as fundamental, well, I don't see any word I use in appropriate, but fundamental features of reality, even that word is inappropriate.
8328000	8350000	And then what you see, and it's this sort of grand, unifying field theory of Western spirituality, then you see Zen gathering together elements of Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintoism, and also coming to a very convergent kind of, no, no, underneath it, right, is it, right?
8351000	8369000	It's actually the interconnectedness and the interconnectedness and time, relationality is the deepest ground, and you have, you have like a philosopher in the West like Heidegger trying to open us back up to that, and then you have the Kyoto school in, right, in Japan, trying to bridge between this.
8369000	8385000	And what that brings back, what that brings up is the possibility of what I call the philosophical Silk Road. The Silk Road belonged to no one, and it allowed people to commerce, not only a commerce of things, but a commerce of ideas, but they needed a lingua franca.
8385000	8400000	And it was sort of Neoplatonism from the West, and Zen from the East, and then there also seems to be interactions with Vedanta and other things. And what it gives you is it gives you, right, nobody owns this.
8400000	8420000	No, just like nobody owns English, but it gives people a grammar, right, a deep grammar by which they can, right, they can enter into these large scale recreations of fundamental understanding of human being in the world.
8420000	8436000	And so I think that's a real possibility for us. And we, by the way, there's a, there's a, there's a long history of trying to bridge between, there's, there's a, there's like 40 years of history in the West of what's called Zen Christianity, where people have been mapping Zen.
8436000	8458000	This is something that people are, are, are. No, I'm not saying that the religion of the future is Zen Neoplatonism. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is these two could be brought into, because they have important differences, they could be brought into a profound opponent processing that could be that from which the
8458000	8475000	acceptation can occur. That's that side of the project. The other side of the project is, can we build ecologies of practices? Can we build networks of communities like what happens in the early Christian church? Can we, can we, and can we get them integrated with our best understanding of meaning making of religion?
8476000	8489000	Can we build these communities? Can we build these ecologies of practices? Can we network them together? And I'm invested in involved in creating that and trying to get, can we get this and this going together? And the hope is, out of that can emerge the possible
8489000	8499000	acceptation. And it has to be as different from the Axial religions as the Axial religions were from the Bronze Age religions. That's the proposal.
8500000	8521000	It's a project, even. Now notice what I'm not saying. I'm not saying I'm going to make this. What I'm going to say is, can I get the very best of what drew everything together, draw it together, put it into a living community, living ecologies of practices, so that there's a possibility that the sacred could speak to us again. That's what I'm proposing.
8522000	8527000	I think the sacred is beginning to speak to us again. That's my observation.
8527000	8528000	Yes.
8529000	8552000	And I notice one of the nice things for me is that a lot of young people are very interested in my ideas and extremely dissatisfied with the thin gruel of, if you can call it a philosophy, by which our civilization now lives or fails to thrive.
8552000	8573000	So I think there's a thirst for it. And I think it can't be compelled in any way. I don't believe we can invent religions at will at any rate. I think they grow organically or are founded by communities in a way that we don't need to think about reinventing religions.
8573000	8601000	There are religious traditions, wisdom traditions, spirituality traditions that are very robust. I've become less enthusiastic about a kind of spiritual sense that is sort of made up to do with, you know, I don't want to sound patronizing, but there are some kind of almost pseudo religious cults that are growing up,
8601000	8618000	that I think could be quite worrying, actually, because a religion carries with it a lot of power. That's why it's one of the few ways in which we can exert power, not we can exert power, but power can be exerted through us for good.
8618000	8640000	I'm not saying it couldn't be for bad as well. That is part of what I'm saying. But if we have to think of the things that we really need, like this closely or more closely bound society in which we learn to trust one another and share values, that's extraordinarily important.
8640000	8658000	I can't remember his name, but I think a third century Chinese emperor said, for a civilization, there are three things that are important. Guns, food and trust. If you have to give up one, give up guns. If you have to give up another, give up food. But if you give up trust, you cannot survive.
8659000	8674000	And that is what we are losing very, very fast. There's a sort of way in which people now think which is that if I can get away with it, I should. So in other words, we're relying on external pressures, external constraints, external restraints on us.
8674000	8696000	And if they aren't there, then we can just do anything, which is not, obviously it's not any kind of morality, but it's also very dangerous because at some point faced with that kind of philosophy, it will be impossible to constrain and restrain everybody who wishes to do wicked things.
8697000	8718000	So I think that's, I want to just say a few things. It may take a few minutes, but so I think it will provide many things. It will provide a kind of structure, philosophical framework, a sense of a tradition through which we can re-experience something very beautiful.
8719000	8728000	Beautiful good and true in my view, which is what the greatest art of our civilization has produced.
8729000	8740000	And I'm not here excluding other civilizations as anyone who reads my work will know I derive a lot from Chinese, Japanese, Indian and other kinds of cultures.
8740000	8769000	So there's that. And I think also there is something highly motivating, which is, I think it's very important that we get away from the idea that we are simply passive here in this world, that we come into it and certain things sort of are blasted at us and we are receptive or non-receptive to them rather like a photographic plate or a sound recorder.
8770000	8783000	I don't believe that's the way it works on a whole number of levels. The first is that I think we have responsibilities on several levels and this needs to be said because it's not known anymore.
8784000	8791000	One is, and I know you would share this, that the way in which we attend to things changes what there is to attend to.
8792000	8813000	And that means that we are, whether we like it or not, we have a moral responsibility to be careful about how we use and how we dispose our attention because we can create bad things by attending in a certain way or we can produce a good result by attending in another way with a different disposition of one's heart and mind.
8814000	8833000	So I think that's one. I think another is that we may actually in some sense help to bring about, at a more cosmic level, a turn for good, for promoting the sacred.
8834000	8855000	So my model of whatever it is that we mean by the divine ground of being is not that it's just sort of sitting there passively, but that it is interacting with its creation, the creation that it has grounded, and that it is coming to know more of itself and its creation is coming to know more of itself in the dance of evolution that the two do together.
8856000	8864000	This is really a Whiteheadian idea, but it's one I find compelling as I find much of Whiteheads philosophy deeply compelling.
8864000	8877000	And I think there are other ways to that we can help prepare things in a way which is, even if we don't succeed is a fine project to devote our lives to.
8877000	8899000	So, in the Lurianic cabala, there is a story of creation which is rather different from the one in Genesis, but it begins with the divine being the ground of being ends off, bringing something into existence because ends off is essentially relational, the foundations of everything are relational.
8899000	8909000	And I believe, and I think you have said this too, that I certainly think the relationships are prior to Relata relations are the foundations of everything.
8909000	8917000	And the Relata come out of the network of relations at the intersection points. We see things that attract our attention. There's a thing.
8917000	8928000	So if that's the case, then anyway, you'd expect this divine being to want to create something that was other than itself in order to have a relationship with it.
8928000	8945000	And if God is as is held in almost all spiritual traditions, love, then love needs to have another and it needs also not to compel that other, because it cannot, it cannot love something that is under entirely predictable and under its control.
8946000	8963000	So that view of the cosmos, which I think is wonderfully developed in Christianity through the idea of a God that makes himself vulnerable by a creation that is free, either to reciprocate his love or not reciprocate it.
8963000	8972000	I want to come back to the cabalistic story. So the first act of this creative God is not to stretch out a hand and make something happen.
8973000	8981000	It's to withdraw. It's to rein itself in so that there's a space for something other. That's called Sim Tsong, which simply means withdraw.
8981000	8995000	And then the second phase is called Shepharat Hekellim, which means the shattering of the vessels, because in this space that's been created, there are 12 vessels and a single spark comes out of it and it often lands on the vessels and shatters them.
8995000	9003000	In fact, it only shatters eight out of the 12, explaining why it would take me too long. So let's just accept that.
9003000	9020000	And then the third phase, in which humanity, according to the Judea tradition, has a particular role that only it is capable of carrying out, which is to repair the shattering, to couldn't repair.
9020000	9032000	And the idea is that we are tasked with creating again these vessels so that they are more beautiful than they were before they were shattered.
9032000	9049000	And the image that always comes to mind for me here is the Japanese art of Kintsugi, whereby a piece of ceramics that is broken is repaired, sometimes with lines of gold, and is considered more special, more precious, more beautiful afterwards than it was before.
9049000	9070000	Now, if it is true that we have the capacity to see how to repair things, and no other beings can see that, and I think that is probably right, there's no disrespect to the rest of animal life, that probably we have this ability to see other things and see beyond and foresee things in a way that they probably don't.
9070000	9086000	So I think if that's the case, then we have a special role there, and we may even have a role in bringing about the existence of God, because that may sound very strange, and possibly blasphemous, but the way in which I think this works is like this.
9086000	9101000	We all know Pascal's wager, Pascal's wager with a simple one, either there is a God or there isn't. If there is a God, then it's very important that we should recognize and reciprocate our relationship with that God.
9101000	9106000	If there is no God, then it won't do us any harm to behave as if there was a God.
9107000	9125000	But I think there's a third possibility, which is McGilchrist's wager, and it has the first two of Pascal in it, but there was a third one, which is that maybe we play a role in the development, the evolution, the furtherment, the fulfillment of whatever is divine.
9125000	9139000	So if that's the case, then once again we have an incredibly ennobling obligation, which is to make sure that we do help that good progress in the world.
9139000	9150000	So on various levels to do with how we dispose our attention, the role we play in repair, the role we play in furthering and bringing about the divine, we can influence things.
9150000	9166000	And we may not be able to stop certain specific wars or whatever, but that's never been part of what is imaged here. Part of what is imaged here is that we, like it or not, are gathered up into something that we have to respond to.
9166000	9177000	And I believe that the reason for the being life at all, and especially human life, is because whatever it is that is the ground of being needs response, it needs that response.
9177000	9189000	And while it can be satisfied by the response of the inanimate world up to a point, what life brings, because I believe all life is sacred, but also the inanimate is sacred as well.
9189000	9206000	The difference is not that one suddenly is involved with consciousness and the other isn't. I think they're both manifestations of consciousness, but the thing about life is that it can respond enormously much faster and to a greater extent so that things can move
9206000	9223000	instead of having to wait for this very slow, slow process with creatures like us that can be an acceleration of the evolution of the cosmos and the divine being that grounds that cosmos together.
9223000	9239000	So, all in all, there is an enormously optimistic in my view and real and I'm a skeptical person in many ways, but I'm also skeptical of skepticism when it rules things out that we should open ourselves to.
9239000	9252000	And if I'm honest about my thinking, my reading, my experience of life as a person, as a doctor and so on, I do believe that this is the way the cosmos is and how we relate to it.
9252000	9260000	And that is surely something that brings hope, brings dignity to the human condition.
9260000	9270000	And it also takes the burden of having to solve certain specific problems. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to solve those specific problems. We must.
9270000	9282000	But it's innocent secondary. It's like the role of the the the emissary is to get on and find ways of, you know, purifying the oceans. This is terribly important.
9282000	9292000	But it mustn't stop there because as I say, you could purify the oceans. You could save the rainforest. And the only reason we did that was for our own economy and for our own flourishing.
9292000	9311000	We would have lost the main reason, which is because these things are powerful, beautiful, rich, complex entities that have their value in themselves. They are intrinsic in their nature, not of extrinsic use to us.
9312000	9315000	Do you have a question or do you want to reply?
9315000	9317000	Go ahead.
9317000	9329000	First of all, I share that vision in a lot of ways. As I mentioned, Kabbalah comes out of the intersection of Neoplatonism with Judaic thought.
9329000	9343000	But what I what I would like to try and afford and not make, and there's a big difference, you don't make wisdom, you cultivate it. You don't do nothing. You cultivate the conditions and it has to take us and it has to flower.
9343000	9345000	Right.
9345000	9356000	I would like to afford something that can work at the global level that needs to be addressed here, given the novelty of the global level of the problems that Daniel is.
9356000	9367000	So I'm trying to find something that is properly pluralistic. So running through Whitehead and running through Kabbalah and running through Sufism is this Neoplatonic framework.
9367000	9376000	And then running through many things in, for lack of a better word, I don't like the word, but the East, right, is its end sensibility.
9376000	9377000	Absolutely.
9377000	9385000	And then there's ways in which really helpfully they converge, but they differ. So proper opponent processing between them is possible.
9385000	9396000	And the idea is this could take on a life of its own such that something could, well, it exact out of it, emerge out of it. That's what I'm proposing.
9396000	9412000	So I think that's needed because we need something where, like the Silk Road, everybody can participate in it, but the Christian can go on the Silk Road and then return with their Christianity enriched.
9412000	9425000	The Buddhists can go on the Silk Road and return and Buddhism is rich, but there's also something that's alive at a global level that is also affording something new to be born.
9425000	9427000	That's the proposal I'm making.
9427000	9432000	I agree with you. And there was nothing in what I said that suggested that it was restricted in its scope.
9432000	9433000	Yes.
9433000	9446000	In fact, I was talking about the way in which we actually have power, which is not mechanistic and therefore to do with the effects of individual actions.
9446000	9447000	Yes.
9447000	9459000	It's a relationship with the cosmos, in fact. And, you know, one of the great sayings, of course, is to live the change or be the change that you wish to see.
9459000	9467000	And so in all these movements, I think there has to begin with one's own orientation and one's public commitments.
9467000	9468000	Yes.
9468000	9469000	These two go hand in hand.
9469000	9470000	Yes.
9471000	9474000	You can't instill wisdom. It's not like that.
9474000	9480000	But you can follow people or admire people or model yourself on people.
9480000	9495000	We all do this whether we realize it or not. We have people that we have thought exceptionally inferential and venerable that we don't somehow have rules about how to be that kind of person.
9495000	9502000	We know intuitively there is this kind of a person and we get moved towards what that is. And so, sorry, do you want to come in?
9502000	9506000	Well, there's two things about that. One is, yes, there's empirical evidence supporting this.
9506000	9507000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9507000	9518000	That the singularly most predictive of people aspiring and carrying out an aspirational project, properly aspirational, not utilitarian, but I should be better than I am.
9518000	9519000	Yes.
9520000	9521000	Yes, absolutely.
9521000	9523000	That's the thing and that's the perspectival.
9523000	9524000	Exactly.
9524000	9535000	And then the second thing is, you know, what Thich Nhat Hanh said, the next Buddha is the Sangha. I think there's a way in which the role model doesn't have to necessarily be an individual.
9535000	9539000	It can be a community in a powerful and new way that is also something.
9539000	9540000	We also need that.
9540000	9541000	Yeah.
9541000	9549000	And if there's going to be regeneration and, you know, tomorrow I'm going to Bristol to take part in the local futures symposium.
9549000	9557000	The idea there being that if there's a future for us, we must generate it locally. We mustn't rely on the global everything to supply us.
9557000	9571000	We must start growing our food locally and trusting and using the contributions and gifts of those around us, not just through an abstract machine like Amazon.
9571000	9577000	Now, I mean, that may be difficult, but it's an important aspiration and I think it's necessary too.
9577000	9581000	So we need to be balancing in the sense of opponent processes.
9581000	9582000	Yes.
9582000	9589000	We need to be able to pick up the things that need to be done at a global level, but we also need to be modeling that at the local level.
9589000	9596000	And what we need to do is create the circumstances in which wisdom can grow because it can't be made to happen.
9596000	9606000	All you can do is stifle it or permit it. It's like a gardener cannot make a plant. The gardener can either permit the plant to flourish or stifle it.
9606000	9611000	This brings up a place where I was wanting to go, which has to do with more local religion.
9611000	9612000	Yeah.
9612000	9623000	First, I just want to acknowledge you were kind of reifying choice that we're not just receptive beings here, but we have choice and inherent to reifying choice was obligation.
9623000	9629000	And that obligation was not imposed from the outside, but was the result of the kind of recognition.
9629000	9637000	And I really like that. I think that's an important thing, that obligation, wisdom, restraint, I think are all going to be critical topics.
9637000	9645000	And as you said, we can't impose that on people. We cannot mechanistically make it, but it can be cultivated.
9645000	9657000	To your project, the idea of a deeply respectful giving the benefit of the Tao inquiry into the previous religious, philosophic endeavors that had some success.
9657000	9668000	And some kind of synthesis, not homogenization, but a synthesis that recognizes that they might orient towards different but meaningful things and holding those together useful.
9668000	9673000	I think this is really good. And I am appreciating that you said Western and certain Eastern things.
9673000	9680000	But what comes to mind is that both what we call the Western and Eastern traditions are very new relative to most of sapient history.
9680000	9688000	And there's a reason I'm saying this that isn't just kind of like the obligate point to point out that there is a global south and there's things pre-civilization.
9688000	9698000	There's actually a really important reason I bring it up is if we've had some hundreds of thousands of years of sapient existence,
9698000	9703000	and we've only had these kinds of religious, philosophic structures for some small number of thousands of years.
9703000	9708000	Most of human experience is in this other thing. And a big part of it was that it was always local.
9708000	9713000	And that means that it wasn't trying to create a mimetic structure that's scaled.
9713000	9725000	And there's something intrinsic to mimetic structures that scale that goes along with techno-economic military structures that scale that I think is worth exploring a little bit.
9726000	9734000	You were mentioning in one of your talks that intelligibility is not just about abstraction, where all the differences go away.
9734000	9739000	Being able to notice uniqueness and instantiation and distinction.
9739000	9744000	Difference has to be as real as sameness. And that's the fundamental challenge to reductionism.
9744000	9749000	Reductionism says only what things haven't shared is the same, counts as real.
9749000	9756000	So there's something about scale, standardization, and reduction that go together very well.
9756000	9760000	This has been pointed out that this is deep to the post-modern critique.
9760000	9764000	And wisdom cultivation is always unique to the moment. It's not trolley problems.
9764000	9769000	It's instantiated what is a good choice in this moment utilizing all of the capabilities.
9769000	9773000	Left hemisphere, right hemisphere, all the chakras, however you want to think about it.
9773000	9777000	And also unique to this person, unique to this time and context.
9777000	9787000	So I find it interesting that almost every indigenous wisdom tradition that developed in much smaller contexts,
9787000	9791000	where everyone had much more intimate relationships to each other, rather than abstracted relationship,
9791000	9795000	we're all Christian, we're all Hindu, whatever, that they were all animistic.
9795000	9803000	And so in terms of the Catholic and Hindu conversation around is God transcendent or God eminent,
9803000	9809000	if anything aired on the eminent side, right, that the Creator is indwelling within the creation.
9809000	9813000	And if the Creator is indwelling within the creation, maybe also beyond any part of it.
9813000	9817000	So transcendent, not meaning elsewhere, but beyond any aspect.
9817000	9824000	But in dwelling in each aspect, then any destruction of anything is sin, is a violation of the sacred.
9824000	9829000	There's something about airing in the direction of eminence that is less dangerous.
9830000	9832000	Airing in the direction of eminence, yes.
9832000	9839000	And there's something about also at the small scale, like we're talking, we're having a conversation,
9839000	9843000	a lot of people are going to get to see, but we're not necessarily taking people through a practice
9843000	9848000	that is inducing the kinds of states, the right hemispheric state where the numinous is there, right?
9848000	9853000	Where the sacred is there, where the intimacy is there, and I don't want to violate something I'm intimate with.
9853000	9859000	There's something about the small scale that has high intimacy, high touch,
9859000	9864000	in which I'm not relating to the abstract concept of they're Christians, they're on my side,
9864000	9866000	they're not Hindus on the other side or whatever.
9866000	9869000	I'm relating to this unique person, and this one, and this one.
9869000	9872000	It is inherently, I think, hemispherically different.
9872000	9881000	I was also thinking about, so I'm curious how much you see hemispheric dominance having to do with scaling is one question.
9881000	9886000	I'm also very curious about, and I've had other friends want to ask you this,
9886000	9891000	if matriarchal and metrophocal cultures had any difference in this particular way,
9891000	9901000	given the, is there a evolutionary difference in tending the babies and tending life at warrants in this way?
9901000	9907000	And then we come back to the challenge that we have global scale problems that have global drivers.
9907000	9912000	If the Chinese are, the US has to, and because the US is, the Chinese have to, we have to deal with that.
9912000	9921000	But scaling, if it involves standardization, abstraction, and a loss of instantiation, is inherently part of the problem.
9921000	9927000	So how do we get something that is profoundly instantiated, profoundly unique, profoundly local,
9927000	9933000	and also cultivate that in a way that has the distribution that it needs?
9933000	9940000	Yeah. I'm sympathetic to animism.
9940000	9953000	And one interesting thing here is if you experimentally suppress the left hemisphere for, say, 10 or 15 minutes,
9953000	9959000	people describe things that they would normally consider inanimate as animate.
9959000	9966000	So they see the sun as animate moving across the sky and giving energy.
9966000	9974000	And if you do the opposite and suppress the right hemisphere, they see things that we would normally think of as living as not.
9974000	9980000	So people are like bits of furniture, like zombies or simply machines.
9980000	9986000	So there is a clear difference now. I'm so fascinated. I'm a panentheist.
9986000	9996000	I think that's an important analogy, if you like, but it goes further than animism and it manages to bring together eminence and transcendence.
9996000	10000000	So pantheism simply says God is all the stuff that there is.
10000000	10006000	Panentheism says God is in all the stuff that there is, and all the stuff that is, is in God.
10006000	10021000	I think that is a, maybe we don't need to explore that too much, but I would say that is a very, to me, important and sounds to me, feels to me a wise way of thinking about the world.
10021000	10035000	And would also, if taken seriously, stop us fighting between religious groups and would stop us just spoiling the natural world and would instill the sense of proper reverence.
10035000	10041000	And there's nothing, of course, in religion that says that we've got to see ourselves over and against other people.
10041000	10046000	In fact, in many religions, your first duty is those who are not of your kind.
10046000	10052000	I mean, I know that's part of Zoroastrianism, actually, but it's also in Christianity.
10052000	10059000	And that doesn't mean that the history of these religions has not been a war between those who really understood the mystical meaning of it,
10059000	10072000	and those who used it as a lever for power and influence and for adversarial approaches, paragraphs.
10072000	10076000	So, all of that, now you said something else.
10076000	10079000	How do we, what was the first thing that you did?
10079000	10080000	Scale.
10080000	10089000	Yeah, the thing about scale actually brings me to something that I was thinking when I was listening to your talk to the Consilience Project or conference,
10089000	10108000	which is that you made the important point that what gives something a sense of reality and tells us something about itself is in the differences, not in the sameness.
10108000	10113000	But of course we need to be able to aggregate things in order to be able to live.
10113000	10116000	We can't experience everything as new and original and unique.
10116000	10117000	Of course.
10117000	10121000	And both hemispheres generalize, actually, but in different ways.
10121000	10135000	So the left hemisphere generalizes by, there's a feature here that they have in common, whereas the right hemisphere generalizes by there being a sort of what Wittgenstein called a family resemblance.
10135000	10140000	There being a general gestalt holding together of things.
10140000	10161000	But what's it really intriguing is people think that because the left hemisphere is focused on detail, that it must somehow not involve generalization and that because the right hemisphere sees the whole, it's neglectful of the individual case.
10161000	10169000	It turns out that to understand the unique case is very strongly dependent on the right temporary parietal region.
10169000	10171000	It's the right hemisphere that understands uniqueness.
10171000	10178000	The left hemisphere doesn't understand uniqueness because it's already categorized things as I see it's another one of those and goes in that box.
10178000	10189000	So there's a huge literature on that and some of it that I reported in my previous books, but the point there is that there are two ways of thinking of the small if you like.
10189000	10192000	One is the tiny part that is a detail.
10192000	10197000	The other is the uniqueness of something which is not strictly measurable.
10197000	10200000	It's how big is the uniqueness of your wife?
10200000	10204000	You know, excuse me, this is not a sensible question.
10204000	10215000	And also in generalizing the right hemisphere doesn't generalize in the sense of trying to find a way in which it all fits a known schema, but sees the bigger picture.
10215000	10222000	Whereas the left hemisphere manages to get that wrong by not seeing the bigger picture but seeing lots of examples that can be generalized.
10222000	10234000	So the conflict between sameness or oneness on the one hand and difference and multiplicity on the other crosses the hemispheres in a recognizable different way.
10234000	10244000	And I think what's important about union and division is that we need them both, not just one, but we need them to be unified, not divided.
10244000	10249000	So the meta level union trumps division, but it must not abolish division.
10249000	10259000	So we need in our in our ontology to be able to at least distinguish, but that distinction doesn't mean there's an irreparable separation.
10259000	10272000	And unfortunately, the way we talk we often think that if we differentiate we've completely divided and sundered, whereas it's very important to realize that distinction is enormously important to be able to discriminate differences.
10272000	10290000	Is what we have a mindful functioning of and how we come to experience the multiplicity of life, but it doesn't entail us in in in a sort of abandonment of a sense of the togetherness as well.
10290000	10294000	Well, I'd like to reply to that and reply to both of you.
10294000	10306000	And again, and the argument I was making at the Consolian's conference is that intelligibility is actually the complete togetherness of the integration and the differentiation.
10306000	10307000	Exactly.
10307000	10308000	So that's good.
10308000	10309000	Yeah.
10309000	10313000	But like there has to be both for there to be intelligibility.
10313000	10314000	We agreed then.
10314000	10315000	Right.
10315000	10322000	And then the neoplateness we're very much on about that the one is that it is not the one of the numerical sequence.
10322000	10328000	We're not only using that word because they're so they go on and on about this is not the numerical one.
10328000	10336000	This is not we're talking about the oneness of of integration and differentiation, which are very hard.
10336000	10338000	There is no logical oneness between them.
10338000	10345000	There is the deeper oneness of intelligibility upon which logic rest logic logic presupposes that deeper thing.
10345000	10347000	And therefore we're called to it.
10347000	10356000	And what they get to see we we were Cartesian and we think the appearance reality distinction is just the inner outer the subjective objective.
10356000	10361000	The ancient world has had a different way of understanding the appearance reality distinction.
10361000	10364000	It was the one mini, which is the problem we're talking about.
10364000	10376000	And it and what it did is it said, there's a deep reflection of neoplatonism on intelligibility and the one in the midi, the emergence up the emanation down to completely
10377000	10394000	right. What it came to in like the coincidence of the opposites is this idea, right, that skiancia intuitiva, right, that you have to be able to see the whole and every part and the part as properly participating in all of the whole.
10394000	10399000	You get the same thing in the Zen, not the same thing. Sorry, wrong word. That's a logical word.
10399000	10405000	You get something convergent from the Zen tradition in Indra's net, how everything is the center of everything else.
10405000	10408000	And that it's a different way of framing things.
10408000	10420000	And I would also say the transcendent and imminent have to be completely interpenetrating and you see late neoplatonist like Nicholas of Cusa and like Erogeena proposing this.
10420000	10433000	I'm worried about our category of animism because for me it sounds like us trying to capture this transjectivity and this transjectivity and then stick it into substantial things, which I think is, I'm worried about that.
10433000	10443000	For example, I don't think life is a property of an organism. I think it's a property of an organism in relationship to its environment in a profound way.
10443000	10462000	And so again, I think we're agreeing and I'm just trying to say that I think that if we can teach people sets of practices that get them to realize this is a deep ontological truth, then they will be called to new ways.
10462000	10469000	And we can't say what they're going to be, but they can be called to new ways of bringing the small and the large.
10469000	10477000	I'm not happy with even those words, the imminent and the trans, but they'll be called to new ways beyond our current grammar for how to bring them into relation.
10477000	10482000	That would be, that would be for me evidence that the new religion is emerging.
10482000	10485000	What do you think about that?
10485000	10498000	Well, I'm curious, because the term new religion is provocative and especially, right, especially in the presence of there being existing religions that have billions of people in them.
10498000	10504000	I don't think you mean that has to replace or supersede those existing ones. I think it can reify them.
10504000	10505000	Yes.
10505000	10517000	And I think, you know, we probably all agree that all of the religions have different ways of interpreting them, some of which lead to holy war and some of which lead to sacred responsibility in different ways.
10517000	10531000	And so the question of, because it's very interesting, obviously, Zen and Vedanta and Lurianic obelism and Christianity are culturally different historically, mytho poetically.
10531000	10539000	But you could say that there might be certain underlying structures they all have to have to orient the human adequately.
10539000	10542000	There's almost like a meta-metaphysics that is necessary.
10542000	10550000	Where does it get the relationship of the one and the many? Does it get the relationship of the determined and the free? Does it get all of those things?
10550000	10570000	And it might be that those meta-dynamics have both the capability of giving rise to new philosophic inquiries as well as reifying the versions of the existing ones that are capable of being in a harmonious relationship with the other ones
10570000	10576000	and capable of being able to understand and steward the power of our technology well.
10576000	10587000	Which I would say, if a religion doesn't do that, it's not adequate for the purpose of being able to orient humans in the world today to steward the world.
10587000	10589000	You almost sung that and it was beautiful.
10589000	10590000	Yes.
10590000	10591000	Sorry, I got into that.
10591000	10605000	So then I think one question I have for you, since you've been thinking about this project, but for all of us, is how might we imagine the reification of the existing religions
10605000	10618000	in a direction that allows them to have something meaningful to say about ecological overshoot and planetary boundaries and AI and synthetic bioregulation and the war in Ukraine and whatever?
10619000	10629000	To orient them to be able to play a role in the stewarding of the world, in the development of the wisdom individually, but the stewarding of the world locally and not just locally, because it's all that.
10629000	10639000	How might we see the reification of those religions and the development of new ones or at least new philosophic metaphysical systems?
10639000	10646000	And then how do we see the interface of those with the other systems of human coordination?
10646000	10650000	If I value things differently, does my economic system change?
10650000	10656000	If I have a different relationship to what is a good problem to solve, does my tech design change?
10656000	10660000	How does education and media change since those are affecting the nature of human minds so profoundly?
10660000	10673000	So the reification of the religions, the development of new philosophic traditions, but also the development of those, when we say you can't force it but you can garden or nurture it, how do you imagine being able to garden and nurture
10673000	10677000	the type of adequate wisdom moving forward in all these ways?
10677000	10681000	Can I just ask you a little terminological thing? You used the word reify and reification a lot.
10681000	10683000	He uses it positively.
10683000	10685000	I know, but do you mean validation?
10685000	10686000	Sure.
10686000	10691000	Because reification to me means making it a thing, and of course that's what we don't want to make it.
10691000	10694000	So I mean...
10694000	10695000	...signifying.
10696000	10708000	So when I was saying to reify, I mean to be able to interpret the religion in a particular direction that is commensurate with what it must be, given the constrained humanity faces.
10708000	10713000	So there's kind of like a pragmatic forcing function on the metaphysics.
10713000	10722000	It's like ray in the respect, looking at it, probably, right? That's how I was getting it, and you're nodding, so I think that's lining.
10723000	10726000	What is the real interpretation is what the scholars will argue on.
10726000	10731000	So there's an interpretation of what does this really mean that can be different.
10731000	10740000	And also, as you said, we're not just painting meaning on the walls of a meaningless universe, but there is actually something intrinsically real they're pointing to.
10740000	10744000	There is, but there's no one way as you were saying it.
10744000	10745000	That's very important.
10745000	10754000	That's what I was saying, is that there's something like almost like how every personality, very healthy, psychologically healthy people don't all become the same.
10754000	10757000	Right? As we become psychologically healthier, we don't become the same.
10757000	10763000	Cultures also wouldn't become the same, but they would be, and the culture is almost like the psychology of the many.
10763000	10765000	The religion could be thought of that way.
10765000	10770000	Yeah, but that's how proper pluralism differs from the relativism.
10771000	10773000	Let's use a biological analogy.
10773000	10777000	There are universal principles of evolution, but evolution doesn't say that all the creatures are going to be the same.
10777000	10783000	It in fact tells you that all the creatures are going to be very different and intellectually sensitive, not only spatially, but temporally.
10783000	10789000	So there can be universal principles that predict why you must be contextually sensitive.
10789000	10790000	Yes.
10790000	10793000	And I think that's the kind of thing I'm trying to point us towards.
10793000	10802000	And then what you can do with, I mean, I think Ian has said this off camera and me too.
10802000	10811000	I got a lot of people that come to me and say, you've given me a language so that I can go back and re-home myself in the religion I was brought up in.
10811000	10818000	And then you can think of, and you can think about that homing process is a much deeper kind of education than what we now have.
10818000	10823000	It's closer to what Zach is talking about when he's talking about education as an installment, et cetera.
10823000	10828000	So let's talk about that kind of education and then we could properly empower people.
10828000	10831000	Let's do a concrete example.
10831000	10838000	Okay, let's see the proposal I've been making, not just me, people like Filler, a whole bunch of people, Carson, I think all these people are wrapping into this in powerfully.
10838000	10841000	But Filler makes this argument, and one of his reasons for focusing.
10841000	10850000	Look, really try to get, really, really, try to get that the trinity within Christianity is saying that relationality is primordial.
10850000	10851000	Really get it.
10851000	10855000	Don't think of this as three guys stuck together.
10855000	10865000	Think about them completely interpenetrating, interconnecting, relationality, intelligibility, the logos, the reality, the indwelling in people, the spirit.
10865000	10868000	See, all of that is deeply profoundly relational.
10868000	10873000	Go back and start to practice your practices that way, live that way.
10873000	10880000	And then people are going to find different things relevant and salient in the world and their relationship to the world.
10880000	10886000	And it could open up, like it could switch people from the having mode to the being mode.
10886000	10894000	It could make a difference in their relationship to their spouses, but also in their relationship to economic systems.
10895000	10897000	You understand this.
10897000	10898000	Yes.
10898000	10909000	The pragmatic question I'm asking is, so let's say the Vatican calls you up and says, we agree.
10909000	10919000	We would like to have a uniquely Catholic version of this, and maybe we're stoked if there's a uniquely Muslim and a uniquely Hindu kind of enlightenment of similar types.
10919000	10922000	But we would like a kind of Catholic version.
10922000	10926000	How would you change the way we approach our practices, philosophy, et cetera?
10926000	10935000	Or let's say that the minister of the Department of Education reached out and said, we want to implement K through 12, a wisdom development process.
10935000	10945000	I'm very interested to hear your thoughts on how could the institutions start to actually implement wisdom development practices.
10945000	10952000	Insights, philosophies, such that rather than just we're compelling the person on YouTube.
10952000	10955000	So this is where I think it's different from Zach.
10955000	10965000	I think we have to create enough ecologies of practices within the community before a reformation of education becomes possible.
10965000	10973000	Because unless the lived normativity of the culture changes, attempts to change the education will just be co-opted by the current machinery.
10973000	10977000	So we have to start inside education long enough to see how that works.
10977000	10982000	Everybody gets, you've got to do stuff with the parents, and you've got to do stuff with the culture.
10982000	10985000	If the kids are getting trained for the market, that has inherent limitations.
10985000	10989000	So it becomes tricky because to change anything, you have to change everything.
10989000	10990000	So there's some sequencing.
10990000	10991000	You can't start with one thing.
10991000	10993000	You've got to do lots of things together.
10993000	10994000	Exactly.
10994000	11002000	Which if you change the grounding that has led to the problems we have, will lead naturally to these things flourishing at the slightly higher level.
11003000	11008000	But how we do that has got to be through an implicit process.
11008000	11017000	Because if we try to, as I'm constantly saying, if we try to instigate the things we think are valuable into people, we have not instigated those things.
11017000	11023000	Instead, we've instigated a kind of chain of thought, which is actually contrary to the way in which we...
11023000	11025000	This is your very first book, right?
11025000	11026000	Yeah.
11026000	11027000	Yeah, exactly.
11027000	11030000	Cannot make implicit things explicit without damaging them.
11030000	11031000	Yeah, that's right.
11031000	11032000	Because again, it's criticism.
11032000	11033000	Yeah.
11033000	11036000	So Apollonia's argument was...
11036000	11039000	And this is Plato's argument, too.
11039000	11041000	You can't make people wise.
11041000	11048000	You can properly, again, seduce them so that they can come to love with stuff.
11048000	11050000	But I was getting on to say that, really.
11050000	11053000	I mean, all I was going to say is we can't do it by a direct approach.
11053000	11058000	But we can do it by a more implicit and less direct approach.
11058000	11068000	And that approach is actually, sadly, not original, but it is actually to start re-educating.
11068000	11071000	I mean, or educating, what I'm trying to say.
11071000	11075000	I think we stopped educating children about 40, 50 years ago.
11075000	11082000	We started indoctrinating them and giving them information and testing them on how much of that they've retained.
11082000	11086000	But we didn't do the really important things, which are relational.
11086000	11092000	All the people who really inspired me and taught me did so by their being who they were.
11092000	11098000	And by the way in which the spark jumped across the gaps in the way that Plato describes in the Seventh Epistle,
11098000	11102000	that this is how philosophy is done, not by writing it down.
11102000	11107000	I mean, mysteriously, Plato completely betrayed psychocraties into doing this.
11108000	11114000	So we need to reimagine what an education is.
11114000	11119000	That would mean freeing up teachers from a dead weight of bureaucracy.
11119000	11123000	In fact, that's one of the very practical things that could be done tomorrow,
11123000	11129000	which would be go around universities, go around hospitals, go around schools,
11129000	11135000	and look very critically at all the superstructure of management and so on.
11135000	11140000	And I reckon about 80% of that could go tomorrow and nobody would suffer.
11140000	11144000	In fact, there'd be a lot more money for doing the things that we really want to do.
11144000	11153000	We've become sucked by a parasite, if you like, which is the externalization of the left hemisphere's drive for control,
11153000	11156000	which is administration.
11156000	11160000	And so, I mean, that's a practical answer to the question.
11160000	11167000	But also, we need, apart from freeing up teachers to teach in a way that is individual responsive
11167000	11171000	and alive rather than just a carrying out of procedures,
11171000	11177000	we need actually to, I'm sorry, give people back their cultural tradition.
11177000	11180000	They need to read literature.
11180000	11184000	It's not fashionable to say this, but they need to understand the last 2000 years,
11184000	11186000	otherwise they don't know what they're doing here.
11186000	11188000	They have a very shallow rooting.
11188000	11197000	So we actually do need to teach history, literature, philosophy, music, all like, not just IT,
11197000	11206000	not just procedural learning, but actually creative, empathic understanding of other people,
11206000	11210000	not sitting in judgment on our forebears or on other cultures,
11210000	11214000	but in fact, trying to see our way into how they saw the world.
11214000	11216000	But I'm stupider than we are.
11216000	11218000	And they might actually have seen something we've lost.
11218000	11224000	Okay, so I have a proposal specifically, more practically, about this, which is,
11224000	11228000	first of all, I'll put a pin in something.
11228000	11235000	The problem we face, of course, is the bureaucracy has wrapped itself around a pseudo-religious ideology that justifies this.
11235000	11236000	Absolutely.
11236000	11237000	Tremendously.
11237000	11238000	So that's problematic.
11238000	11239000	It's a pseudo-religion.
11239000	11240000	Yes, very much.
11240000	11246000	And what I would want to say is, I don't think we should have teachers in any one institution.
11246000	11250000	So if you look, I'll just take the West, but there's parallel things elsewhere.
11250000	11256000	You had the university, you had the monastery, and you had the church, and they were all interrelated.
11256000	11260000	And one is a knowledge institution, but it has reverence for the wisdom institution,
11260000	11261000	or that's the monastery.
11261000	11266000	And then you have the church, and the church is, oh, but all of these ideas and all of these philosophies have to be,
11266000	11269000	have to transfer to real lives.
11269000	11271000	If I may just add, also hospitals.
11271000	11273000	Yes, yes, yes.
11273000	11284000	And what I think we need is we need to have teachers in multiple kinds of institutions that are acting again in this opponent processing with each other,
11284000	11285000	not adversarial.
11285000	11289000	Part of the problem is, you know, and then the Protestant Reformation comes in and splits them from each other,
11289000	11291000	and we get all that, all that.
11291000	11298000	But the proposal is, because what we have is we have this idea that teachers are only legitimate if they're in this one,
11299000	11304000	institution, and that, and if we have anybody out, I face this.
11304000	11308000	But the stuff I do outside of the university is like, why are you doing that?
11308000	11309000	Why are you doing that?
11309000	11310000	All right.
11310000	11318000	And I know lots of excellent teachers that can't find a home in the university because they want to do the kind of stuff that universities
11318000	11320000	don't any longer do.
11320000	11321000	Right.
11321000	11331000	And I think we need to think about, we need to think of a living system of teaching institutions where you've got people sort of,
11331000	11335000	but they're bound together in a field again where the relationality is important.
11335000	11340000	This is the pole of knowledge, this is the pole of wisdom, and this is the pole of life.
11340000	11342000	And they have to all, and we have that.
11342000	11350000	And I think that's also something that we need to think about bringing back in terms of institutional structures that can actually transform society in the way we're talking.
11350000	11362000	And I'd like to just add, sorry, we need to encourage and provide institutional support for people who are bright to oversee the whole picture to some extent.
11362000	11363000	Yes.
11363000	11365000	That doesn't happen in our culture anymore.
11365000	11375000	It used to happen, and it used to happen in this university, but now everything has shifted here as everywhere else in the Western world towards ever greater specialization.
11375000	11376000	Yes.
11376000	11379000	And now we need specialists, of course we do.
11379000	11380000	It's not one or the other.
11380000	11388000	We need people who also are able to take the broad right hemisphere view and see, Cracky, look what's happening here.
11388000	11392000	And, you know, I believe that what I've done, if I've done anything in my writing, is to open people's eyes.
11392000	11393000	That's what they're writing here.
11393000	11397000	Of course, once you see it, you see what's going on here.
11397000	11400000	And we don't have any institutions that do that.
11400000	11407000	Back in the 60s, I think the Rand Corporation and others sort of put money behind people that they thought were going to be good.
11407000	11415000	And they just gave them a desk and an office and a Xerox machine and said, you know, do what you want.
11415000	11422000	And out of that came a lot of, you know, genuinely innovative creative thinking.
11422000	11424000	And we need to bring that back.
11424000	11426000	Could I respond to just one thing?
11426000	11440000	So, because this is dear to my heart, because I represent the discipline that is all about the synoptic integration across the disciplines, cognitive science.
11440000	11441000	Right.
11441000	11451000	And trying to create the lingua franca between neuroscience and information processing, machine learning, psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy.
11451000	11473000	And trying to do that. And the, I mean, there, there has been a turning, an increasing recognition by some about the value of this because the specialization went into psychology in which we incentivized people to innovate something that nobody else had discovered before,
11473000	11485000	finding the effect, the new effect. Right. And this is one of the driving motivations of the replication crisis because if you don't pursue synoptic integration, you don't work out your theoretical grammar.
11485000	11502000	Well, your conceptual vocabulary is vague and equivocal. And what you and then you're the fact that you get empirical data is almost irrelevant because if you get a vague enough construct that isn't bound responsible to anybody else's work of course you can find empirical verification.
11502000	11511000	The replication crisis has basically started to put up a flag. Some people are recognizing it that we need the synoptic integrators as much as we need the specialists.
11511000	11513000	So, that's, I just want to put that.
11513000	11525000	You both made this point. And I think when people look at the arguments about all the things that are supposedly getting better in civilization, some of which are they relate to things that specialization does well.
11525000	11535000	And when we look at the things that are getting worse and heading towards global catastrophic risk, they look at the lack of integrate, they arise from the lack of integration across specialty areas.
11535000	11540000	I think that's actually very important.
11540000	11555000	So, you were speaking to that the existing educational institutions have a history that we actually want to revive some things from and that we've actually lost some very important aspects.
11555000	11572000	You were also speaking to not just the educational institution as a single thing but lots of them. You didn't mention guilds but also there that education needs to be many institutions and maybe in light of the current situations of the world some new institutional design as well.
11572000	11582000	But you said something else that I found really interesting when you talked about cutting some of the bureaucracy and administration which was almost like an externalization of left hemispheric dominance.
11582000	11586000	What David Graber calls bullshit jobs.
11587000	11602000	There's this recursive relationship between kind of left hemispheric process and building a world that is the result of that that in turn conditions that and that kind of recursive relationship means we're not just asking how can we develop things that will give people more wholeness,
11602000	11615000	more integration, more numinous, more sacred but also how can we undo some of the things that are excessively making us hypertrophic on the wrong modes of mind and I think we have to do both.
11615000	11625000	One good thing that might come out of a scarcity crisis is that we find quickly what are the things we can dispense with and what we can't.
11625000	11639000	At least if we maintain enough right hemisphere overview of what's going on but I fear that now the power is concentrated in the hands of frankly mediocre people who occupy administrative jobs.
11639000	11652000	And they're not willing to really relinquish that power and it's their validation but we do desperately need to do it and you're quite right with what happens in a culture like that.
11652000	11667000	People are trained to go into jobs like that and the people who fit the role best are not the people you'd want to be making big decisions about our lives but they go into it and the thing is a positive feedback loop.
11668000	11684000	So how do we break the positive feedback loops that orient us towards the futures nobody wants and how do we or at least weaken them and how do we simultaneously develop other positive feedback loops because they have to have some positive feedback where they won't be able to do anything
11684000	11696000	that move us in a recognition of the sacred wise individual and collective governance. We did not answer that question in full.
11696000	11706000	We spoke to different elements of what it might need to entail but the clock is saying that it is time that we must wrap.
11706000	11716000	Well there are questions that we can answer questions that we can offer a direction for and questions we simply can't in the nature of things answer.
11716000	11719000	So I think we've done the best we can.
11719000	11720000	Yes.
11720000	11726000	And I'd like to think that we could shout this from the rooftops and people some people just a few might listen.
11726000	11737000	So this is my kind of closing question is if some people do listen and respond and there's interest maybe we'll deepen this conversation and explore some of these.
11737000	11750000	How do we weaken the existing positive feedback loops. How do we deal with the fact that power is entrenched in certain ways currently like there's a lot of very interesting open questions we could get into further.
11750000	11772000	But in closing thoughts of I guess now for the listeners who have made it through all of this any closing thoughts that might give them some sense of orientation or agency in the relationship to all these topics.
11772000	11774000	Well I'd say.
11774000	11776000	Don't despair.
11776000	11781000	That is achieving nothing whatever and it's bad for the soul.
11781000	11790000	So we have a duty to see what is hopeful and do we not ask nobody has asked to do the impossible.
11790000	11803000	We can only do the bit that we can and that means doing things in our own life and with our own life and furthering larger causes in the way that we are best in a position to do.
11803000	11813000	But we all have a role and I think one of the things I try to emphasize was that although the materialist reductionist picture.
11813000	11822000	Results in a vision of the cosmos as a heap of junk with no meaning beauty or purpose and that we have no role here I would.
11822000	11838000	You know I go to my death to defend the opposite point of view that actually it is beautiful is rich and it is our pleasure duty and something we should be grateful for to help further that.
11839000	11848000	I like that you said I would go to my death that's the sacrifice and service of the sacred.
11848000	11859000	I would want people to hear that the love of wisdom and the love of being are real possibilities that there are already.
11859000	11875000	People of good faith and good talent doing this individually and collectively and that that opens up a possibility for a kind of transformation so that.
11875000	11888000	As you fall in love with being again instead of the reciprocal narrowing that we've been just been talking about and how we get addicted because that's what addiction is reciprocal narrowing a reciprocal opening is equally possible.
11889000	11906000	This is what Plato proposed with the Anagaga and that that is still actual and there are people and communities and practices that you can go to to actualize that to realize that and there is nothing stopping you from doing that right now.
11907000	11911000	May I make a hemispheric comment.
11911000	11917000	The left hemisphere closes down to a certainty the right hemisphere opens up to a possibility.
11917000	11928000	And so what you've really said is we need to further the processes of the right hemisphere which are always expanding and exploring rather than those that close down to the arid bit of something we think we know.
11928000	11932000	Yeah I don't want I'm not proposing cognitive closure I want continuity of contact.
11932000	11935000	I know you.
11935000	11952000	I think the religion the concern about religions that many people have actually has to do with people orienting to certainty with them and then close mindedness and holy wars and whatever as opposed to the exact opposite holding the mystery at the center holding
11952000	11956000	the unspeakable the unknowable but the real.
11956000	11960000	And so there is an epistemic humility that is built in forever.
11960000	11963000	We spoke about this yesterday and you said don't despair.
11963000	11979000	We actually I liked in our conversation you're saying when we are actually open to the beauty of reality there's a sense of awe and gratitude and humility that comes with that.
11979000	11987000	But when we're open to the beauty of reality being harmed which is in the factory farm and on the war field and whatever we're also.
11987000	11999000	Feel the suffering of others such that it's overwhelming and the overwhelm in the suffering and the overwhelm in the beauty are related because if the reality wasn't beautiful you wouldn't care.
11999000	12005000	And both of them make you transcend your small self and both of them motivate the sacred obligation.
12005000	12017000	So there's something where the sacred obligation just comes from seeing clearly letting yourself be moved by the beauty of reality and associated with that the meaningfulness to protect it.
12017000	12032000	And the role of the new religion philosophy whatever in so far as it can help people be more sensitive to both the beauty and sacredness and thus a protective impulse towards reality is what I am hoping people take away.
12032000	12034000	Excellent.
12034000	12035000	Well, thank you face.
12035000	12037000	Yeah, likewise.
12037000	12038000	This is joy.
12038000	12039000	It has been a great pleasure.
12039000	12041000	I really enjoy the interview.
