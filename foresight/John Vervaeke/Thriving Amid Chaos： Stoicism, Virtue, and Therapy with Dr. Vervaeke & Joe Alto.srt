00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
John Varvakey and Sean Coyne have together authored a new book,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,840
Mentoring the Machines. It's a book about artificial intelligence and the path forward

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,120
that further develops the arguments of how to align artificial intelligence to human flourishing,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,280
and it sets those arguments into beautiful and accessible writing. It's an incredibly

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,240
timely book. In fact, it will be released August 1st, 2023, as a four-part series that will culminate

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
into a final volume. You can pre-order today a special edition copy that will include a

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,840
signed hardback edition. Pre-order in the link in the description below.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,160
Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Varvakey. I'm very excited here to be talking with Joe

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
Alto. We are going to be doing an interesting thing. I'll let Joe talk about it a little bit more.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,280
Although he's on Voices with Varvakey, we want you to consider that this is, I'm also on Joe's

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,640
channel. We're sort of going to be interviewing each other and talking for both audiences in

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,880
integrated fashion. Welcome, Joe. Thank you so much for having me, John. Just a quick introduction,

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,240
I guess, about myself. As John just mentioned, I have my own YouTube channel called the Gist

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
with Joe. That channel is really dedicated to talking to what I consider great minds in the

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,240
fields of psychology and philosophy, theology, really just culture in general. I essentially

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,800
ask my guests, what's the gist of their intellectual, their artistic, their spiritual

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:31,520
project? We know that distilling what your project is to the gist is a good practice. I like doing

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,400
this with my guests, and it usually blossoms into a really beautiful and meaningful conversation

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,520
afterwards. That's going to be one part of our conversation today. As John said, I'll be on Voices

20
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,920
with Varvakey. John will be on the gist with Joe. Obviously, my channel is much more teeny tiny than

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,000
John's. I guess even further introduce myself. I'm currently studying clinical mental health

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,120
counseling. I am the campus minister at a public university in Cleveland, Ohio, and just very

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:20,640
interested in pursuing what my, as a Catholic man with the church fathers or what other great

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,360
thinkers in philosophy in general would consider the good, the true, the beautiful. I'm on that

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,720
search myself. It's a hard, long search, but having conversations with great thinkers is

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,200
something that helps me with that endeavor. I'm just really honored to be on today. Thank you so much,

27
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Jen. Thank you, Joe. Let me go first. I'll happily answer your gist question. On my side,

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,360
I guess what I'm really interested in hearing from you and talking about it a bit is how does

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,680
my work intersect with your pursuit, your quest as a Catholic man to track the true, the good, and

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,200
the beautiful? How does my work, like, does it help? Does it afford? Does it challenge? Is it a

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,400
problem? Well, it definitely does a lot. It definitely does a lot. Challenge is one really

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,080
good thing. Help is another. It helps a lot. And so, you know, as a Catholic, I will explain,

33
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,800
so, you know, I'm a Catholic campus minister, but I'm also studying intensively right now.

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,160
I'll be able to practice next April. I actually start my clinical internship in a couple weeks,

35
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,680
so I actually start seeing fiction soon. So I'm on this journey right now as I stated in clinical

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,760
mental health. And, you know, I don't have any plans of ever advertising myself, per se, as a

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Catholic counselor. I actually think, and you know what, anyone who does religious specific

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,480
counseling, that's very needed. And I laud, you know, anyone who's watching who does, like I said,

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:10,160
religious specific counseling. However, given just my charisms, my personality, just what my

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,760
goal in this profession is, I don't necessarily plan on ever advertising myself as a Catholic

41
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,920
counselor. However, I do believe that in my, it's in my opinion that counseling, you know, psychotherapy

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,240
is, one can consider a spiritual or religious endeavor. There's many Christian, there's many

43
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Buddhists, there's many Islamic, there's many Jewish, there's really all, every major, you know,

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
world religion and the ethos of that religion, you can see elements of that in the counseling

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,440
profession, right? And so, it's not going to ever be explicit, but you know, it's more so in the

46
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:02,000
implicit of my counseling, that I want to, well, that I will express or exude my Christian faith

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,040
that ever, without ever, possibly ever stating, hey, I'm a Christian man. And so, John, what is

48
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,640
your work coming in for this? So, although I've only had a couple encounters, right, with people

49
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,920
coming to counseling, but in my, in my time in classes, in my work reading the great thinkers of

50
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,920
both, you know, just the psychological field and just even the counseling field, I do know that,

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,200
and although I don't have any stats to prove it, this is more operating the anecdote right here,

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,400
I do know that many people go to counseling, not for, well, what we would consider, what the DSM

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,280
would consider, you know, a particular disorder, right? So, not everyone, so people who are depressed

54
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,800
don't always have a major depressive episode or major depressive disorder, right? People who are

55
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,760
anxious don't always have a specific phobia or generalized anxiety disorder, and that's actually

56
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,480
one of the downfalls of the current field of counseling, in my opinion, is, you know, the

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:11,200
overdiagnoses of these diseases. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. You said it, and again, I don't know the,

58
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm going to misfire on the exact quote, but you once said that in all of his time counseling,

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,360
around something like 60% of the patients he ever saw were never dealing with an actual

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,240
psychological disorder, but they were dealing with, and John, this is where you come in, a crisis of

61
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:35,520
meaning. Yes, yes, yes. And, you know, your work has been so influential in what I want to do when I

62
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,760
hopefully knock on wood, right? Either I work with a group or I open up my own practice one day,

63
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:49,840
I want to create really this psychotherapeutic model that invites the individual to think more

64
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,120
deeply about virtue, and that's one thing that I really think plagues so many people. It's like,

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:06,720
if you could just realize, right, how virtues can be, virtue cultivation, how virtue cultivation

66
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:17,520
be so profound and have such a reformational, such a reformational influence on your life,

67
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,640
if you pursue these virtues, I believe that a lot of what people are coming in for, if those

68
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,760
individuals are not suffering from a particular disorder that you could diagnose via the DSM,

69
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:36,000
I do believe that something like virtue cultivation could be a serious modality to really help, you

70
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,880
know what, I'm trying to think what's the word that Aristotle uses in eudaimonia, to get to this

71
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,640
eudaimonic state, right? And that's really the goal of all mental health counseling is you want

72
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,360
the individual to reach this eudaimonic state, you want the individual to be happy, right?

73
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:00,080
And I won't get into like the happiness that is more, well, it's the more profound, it's more

74
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,640
joyful than it is happy, right? Eudaimonic, you want people to be joyful, and yeah, I do believe

75
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,040
that one way that we can reach joy is by the cultivation of virtues, and so yes, your work,

76
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
I think in a lot of what you've been doing with the Beaning Crisis and what you've been doing

77
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,680
with After Sacrities and what you're doing in general is really in alignment with what I'm doing

78
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,680
and I would hope to use your work and to pick your brain a lot, you know, now and in the future

79
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,040
to help me with this effort. Wow, that's a very well-explicated and thoughtful answer.

80
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,160
There's a lot in there. So I'm going to ask a question and it might sound like a challenge,

81
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,840
but I honestly, it's not. So one thing that's happened in response to, and I agree with all the

82
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,840
stats you were laying out, you know, the particulars might be move around a bit. I think the general

83
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,160
point I think is well stated. So one of the ways in which there's been a response, and I know people

84
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,480
that do this like Rick, Rick Rapetti, they've taken up philosophical counseling as a way of trying to

85
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,720
address the people that are coming in not because, I mean the slogan is they're not pathological,

86
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,280
they're confused and they're not sick. They're finding that they're being too foolish in their life

87
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,200
and those are not the same thing. And of course, there's nothing that prevents them from both

88
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,920
being comorbid either. Often you can have both and they're making each other worse

89
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:44,320
in really obnoxious fashion for the person. So are you planning on getting any training

90
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,560
in and incorporating the philosophical counseling into what you're doing because it sounds like

91
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,360
it would also be helpful for you? Yeah, no, I've most definitely looked into it

92
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,920
and I think it would be helpful. And I've already been tapped on the shoulder by a few to pursue

93
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:10,000
things like, you know, become maybe like a union analyst or to, like you said, maybe journey down

94
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
that avenue of what we would consider philosophical counseling. And I'm sure many people who are

95
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,240
watching don't even realize that there might be like this very specific type of counseling. Yes,

96
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,960
it is. Usually the individual who is the counselor usually has a higher degree in philosophy.

97
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,360
Yes. And it's almost like this, you know, I always think, I tell people, many people this

98
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,400
before, you know, I think the greatest counseling relationship that we've ever seen in human history

99
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,320
has been the counseling relationship between Virgil and John today. I really can't believe that

100
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:52,000
that is quite frankly the most beautiful vision of what a counselor should be. It's like, hey,

101
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm going to help you get here. Realize, though, that I can't go with you to that. I can't get to

102
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,080
that same place that we need you to get. But I know that you need to get there. And I have to leave

103
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,760
you behind. And it's going to be sad, right? When we terminate, that's like the counselor,

104
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,680
counselor, when we terminate our relationship, it will be sad. And we have learned a lot from

105
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,720
each other, and we may not ever see each other again. But, you know, realize that again,

106
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,960
this relationship has been reformational, that it's like this beautiful, like,

107
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,360
vocation that we have journeyed on together. But to answer your question more directly,

108
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,440
yes, I have thought about pursuing it. But here's my only issue with that. I want Mike,

109
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
I was talking, so it's actually funny, because I was actually approaching this question with my

110
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,480
wife, literally last week, and I was like, hey, because, you know, it's all about the

111
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
particularities. It's like, okay, well, there's some very practical things that we have to do,

112
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
right? So like, I'm going to open up my own business. So you got to take out a small business

113
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,280
loan and yada, yada, yada. So it actually does, you know, this is, it's not just a me decision,

114
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,680
it's a family decision. And how is this going to affect my wife and my kid and all these things

115
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:11,200
that we were talking. And my vision has always been working with very high insight in individuals

116
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,000
with high insight, right? So individuals who possess high insight. And when you do philosophical

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,960
counseling, you're usually working with individuals with high insight, because who is going to a

118
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,560
philosophical counselor, other than that, other than the individual who has probably is somewhat

119
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,240
learned in, you know, Western, more than likely, Western continental philosophy, right?

120
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,920
And so I was telling her this. And, you know, she said, you know, very wise, she said, well,

121
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
you're really just missing the mark then, at that point. I was like, what does that mean?

122
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:51,600
She said, Joe, you know, you virtue cultivation is not just for the intelligentsia. It's not

123
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,680
just for those in an academic side, right? Virtue cultivation sometimes is needed more

124
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,560
by the individual who don't, who doesn't realize that you cultivate virtues. I mean,

125
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,360
people don't even know if we were to go out on the, our respective cities sidewalks,

126
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,200
we say, what's virtue? Who the hell would be able to, I mean, really, I have a hard time

127
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
myself answering that without the help of great thinkers, right? Like,

128
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,640
so, I mean, so it's not even like my, so I even sometimes have a difficult time buying the correct

129
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:32,400
language that I have to rely on great thinkers of the past. So given that, I mean, stemming from

130
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,040
that, who realizes that we have to cultivate it? People just think, Oh, this is, people have a

131
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,000
very odd relationship with virtue, because they just, they just don't understand that it's a

132
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,320
vocational call, right? That virtue, I believe that virtue truly operates in the beautiful. It's

133
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,560
like, the beautiful is the car and virtue are the parts of the car. So they're very connected,

134
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,720
but you can also make the distinction, right? So I'm not going to say my steering wheel is my car,

135
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,360
but I will say, like, yeah, beauty is the car. And I do believe that virtue is the steering wheel,

136
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,160
because they function similarly, right? Because the beauty and things that are beautiful,

137
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,440
allow the individual, it's like one of the only things in our life that allows us

138
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,760
to not be content with how things are, right? So it's like, we are not content with our lives,

139
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,640
and, you know, philosophically, but even like, put that on like a lower rung of the scale,

140
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,080
maybe I look at my bedroom and it's a mess and I'm like, why? So beauty really orients us

141
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,680
towards the good, right? But it also allows us not to be content. And it calls us, right? Beauty

142
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:56,400
calls us to achieve or go up a rung of understanding and seeing reality more vividly. And that's what

143
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,360
virtue does too. So this is why I really do believe that- Yeah, I agree. That's a very platonic argument

144
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,120
you just made. Very platonic. That's a very platonic argument you just made. Yeah. Right, exactly.

145
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,040
And, you know, I do believe that, you know, Henri de Lubach, Ray, talks about a saturated

146
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,360
phenomena. And I do believe that, I believe that virtue is also operating as a saturated phenomena.

147
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,800
Again, I do believe that virtue, again, being connected with beauty operates in the erotic,

148
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,120
because it's something that calls, it's something that pulls you. It's something that is insightful.

149
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,120
And, you know, I once read this great book, I don't know if, I mean, knowing that you have

150
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,360
spent much time studying Buddhist philosophy, I read this great book in college once upon a time,

151
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
because I also, I was a religious studies major, but most of my time was never actually spending,

152
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,200
well, I was never taking Christian classes, I was taking Buddhist classes. And I read this book

153
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,000
called Alone with Others by Stephen Batchelor. Yeah, yeah, I teach that book. Oh, do you? Okay,

154
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,920
yeah. I taught that book for years. I've met Stephen and had dinner with him. Yeah.

155
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,040
It's a great book. And I also, and again, it's not nothing, it's nothing about the book, by the

156
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,600
way, is about, you know, it's mostly on, you know, Buddhist, a particular Buddhist philosopher,

157
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,400
a Buddhist philosopher's connection with Martin Heidegger. But the book is called Alone with Others.

158
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,760
And that's another way I think that virtue is that virtue functions is that it's an individual

159
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:38,880
pursuit, but you aren't going to realize it unless it's practiced with others, right? So.

160
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:48,320
So let me make sure I'm not losing the thread here. So you're, you took a look at philosophical

161
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,440
counseling, and there was an appeal there, but your wife said something very insightful about

162
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,720
what, you know, maybe the what you're called to is to bring virtue to people who are not

163
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,160
awakened to the quest for virtue. And you want to learn how to awaken them. And one of the functions

164
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,840
of beauty is to awaken them to the quest. And then, and, and, and, and this, yeah, and beauty is

165
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,960
one of virtue is one of these alone with others. We, you know, it's a virtue if you have Gaiji's

166
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,680
ring and you're alone, but it's because you're responsible to other people. I get all that

167
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:28,160
connection. And that was very eloquent. So how does this beautification, how would the beautification

168
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,560
and the awakening to virtue come into sort of the psychotherapeutic practice? Now, first of all,

169
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,040
I give you the caveat. Like if somebody, if somebody's coming in disordered pathological,

170
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,200
that, that has to be, that's exigent. That has to be addressed and dealt with. We're talking about

171
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,760
this other group, the people that are coming in existentially confused, meaning crisis. So

172
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,920
tell me what, how you're like, how you're, this is where a lot of my thoughts are,

173
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,520
I'm ruminating on most of these. So if my answer isn't as developed, please, you know, show me some

174
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,720
compassion, but I'll, I'll, I'll, of course, of course, of course. I was in my own. So I see, you

175
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,960
know, part of my program is that, and I think every good counselor, every good psychotherapist

176
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,240
should see their own psychotherapy. Oh, totally. Totally. I, I, I'm very critical of people who

177
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,600
practice, who have never gone through therapy. Right. It's odd. Um, it's like being a priest,

178
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:33,120
but never going to mass. Yeah. And it's funny. I mean, I don't, I don't really mean to

179
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,920
make this very direct joke, but as a Catholic, right? Sorry. One thing I struggle with, I think

180
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,840
I would struggle with this without, without being Catholic or not, but I have a lot of guilt,

181
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,640
right? That's one thing that I have in me. And I don't, and I work, get into my,

182
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,680
getting into my, my particular sessions, I'm trying to figure out, I'm on my own quest right now,

183
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,560
of figuring out if this guilt is a personality trait, where this guilt comes from, why do I have

184
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,960
this guilt? And it's also yesterday, I had a great, I had a great realization, but it was also very

185
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,600
embarrassing realization that, you know, a lot of my identity, a lot of, a lot of my identity that I

186
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,280
exude is still the identity that I had, you know, when I was in middle school. And that's very

187
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,160
embarrassing, right? But it's like, it's like, it's like these characteristics, these personal,

188
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,200
personality characteristics that I obviously just haven't processed correctly. Right. And they, and

189
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,480
they're not bad, and they don't necessarily get in the way, but they make me for a lot of reasons

190
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
without getting into my psychology, right? They, I have a lot of guilt, like I said, so I feel guilty

191
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,760
for, why am I telling you this? Well, I'm telling you this because I think with people of high insight

192
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
who would come in for this particular type of counseling, maybe something that they would

193
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:02,640
also feel ashamed or guilt. And so usually high insightful people will do something, something

194
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:10,480
very menial, right? Could be menial. Like I lied to my spouse about, I don't know. I mean, maybe

195
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,400
I lied about how many beers I had at the party, or I don't know, maybe, maybe I, maybe I watched

196
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,320
pornography and I feel really bad about that. Maybe I bullied a friend, I jibbed a friend a

197
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,040
little too hard, you know, when we were, you know, in our, in our group text message, or, and you

198
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:38,080
could think of whatever, you know, I feel guilt. Okay. And then, you know, unfortunately, nowadays,

199
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,600
I mean, how everyone who feels guilt, like four times in a week, or am I a narcissist? Am I this?

200
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,120
Am I, no, no, no, let's, let's, let's take deep breath and let's, let's take this. What if it's

201
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:58,000
not guilt? What if it's not shame that you're experiencing? What if, again, because like virtue

202
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,640
is a call, right? It's something that calls you. So what if virtue was a call? And what if the fact

203
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,960
that you were able to admit to me that you lied to your wife, or you did something dishonest,

204
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,880
you did something that wasn't courageous, you did something, you know, you did, you did something

205
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
again, you just didn't enjoy the fact that you're able to sit here in a counseling session and tell

206
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,000
me that you have guilt and that you didn't enjoy it. Maybe that's not guilt at all. And maybe

207
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,600
that's your conscious telling you, or maybe that's virtue, right, trying to signal to you

208
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,040
that you should pursue this further. The fact that you were able to feel that the fact that you

209
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,320
knew that it was wrong to lie, the fact that it was the fact that, you know, you were being

210
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,720
deceptive, that you were being surreptitious. That insight right there might allow you to

211
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,920
realize that, no, no, I don't need to feel guilty, but the fact that I was cognizant of my fault,

212
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,920
maybe that's actually virtue communicating with me and inviting me to indulge in a deeper

213
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,720
relationship with virtue. Well, I see. I see. So you're reframing it. It's very

214
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,320
high agarient, which Stephen would love, Stephen Bachelor. Yeah. You know, the conscience is,

215
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,680
there's an existential version of conscience. There's a psychological version of conscience,

216
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,520
which is basically your internalization of certain norms. And you punish yourself as a way of

217
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
redirecting your behavior, guilt and shame. They're not the same thing, but they're sort of working.

218
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,840
But then there's an existential sense where conscience is the call to authenticity. You're

219
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,080
saying conscience could be understood as the call to virtue. So where does the beauty come in? Is

220
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,920
that trying to see the beauty of the life that you could be called to? Is that the idea? Yeah,

221
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:10,160
that's precisely it. And even trying to, you know, again, like, I think if you pursue and

222
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,040
try to cultivate and therefore try to live a virtuous life, I do think, yeah, in that process,

223
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,760
I mean, life automatically becomes more beautiful, right? So what's a more beautiful vision of life

224
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,360
that I'll complete as hard as it could be a complete honest relationship with your wife or

225
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,280
dishonest relationship with your wife? And what's more beautiful, right? What's a higher form of

226
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,880
that? Right. So yeah. So yes, what you said precisely. Oh, that's very interesting.

227
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,680
So like, yeah, I could see how a lot of the work that I do would be relevant to that project.

228
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:53,840
And so how does, you know, the truth, the truth of the beautiful David Chindler,

229
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,880
who I get to talk to, you know, these are the transcendentals. They're the transcendentals

230
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,520
because they apply universally across domains. But the idea is their ultimate unity is in

231
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:14,880
is in the one or God, your Catholic, so I'll say God for your benefit. How does that sense of the

232
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,880
transcendence, you know, Plato, the symposium, the cult of the love of virtue is not the final love,

233
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,680
we move beyond that to the love of the source of intelligibility or the possibility of virtue,

234
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
the ground of being, the ground of life, the ground of wisdom, that sort of

235
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:42,320
vision that's articulated in Aquinas or Maximus. How does, so now given all of that sort of

236
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,880
explication, how does God show up in this for you? Yeah, I mean,

237
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,160
you're Catholic, so it's fair to re-ask that question, I think. 100% it's fair. So again, like,

238
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,760
this is why I bring up, this is why I say that Dante and Virgil is such a good model.

239
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,400
It's, you know, in a counseling session, I don't know if I would, I mean,

240
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,960
unless the individual is comfortable with bringing it up, you know, then I would talk about God, but

241
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,760
yeah, well, you, I mean, you almost, I think and challenge me and push me further, but I really

242
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,080
almost think that, you know, you gave the answer in your question though. And when it's, you know,

243
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,480
all these things are in submission to the one, right? Virtue and beauty and the true and the good.

244
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,440
And I don't, you know what, I'm having a hard time trying to order three transcendentals in my own

245
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,000
life. I would love to get your take on that. It's like, you know, what's, it's like, what's, you

246
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,560
know, everyone tries to say, oh, you pursue the good and that opens up the beautiful and that

247
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,040
gives you truth. I don't necessarily think that it matters how you orient the three transcendentals

248
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,680
for me personally. I believe, like I said, that beauty is the most approachable because, yeah,

249
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,080
that's what Plato thought, because beauty is the one that reaches so readily and obviously into the

250
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,360
sensual aspect of our being in the way that truth and goodness don't. We can see and touch beauty

251
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,600
in a way in which we can see and not, we cannot see and cannot touch truth and goodness. So I think

252
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,440
David Gendo talks about it as, what is it? I might get it wrong, but something like the primacy

253
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,120
of beauty, it comes first, but the centrality of truth and then I think the ultimacy of goodness,

254
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,840
or it could be those two the other way around, but they each have a superlative, but in different

255
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:44,480
ways. I think, I think speaking temporally, I think beauty comes first. I saw, but what we have to

256
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,760
remember is to not, and human beings have a proclivity to this, this error. We have, we shouldn't

257
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,800
confuse, that's what David's trying to address. We shouldn't confuse temporal priority with

258
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,320
ontological priority. Just because beauty comes first doesn't mean it's the first of the transcendentals,

259
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:09,680
right? They're all first in different ways. Beauty is temporally first. I think the true is

260
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,080
central in some way, but they have different priorities. And I, like I say, kind of remember

261
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,840
which way David does it. It's really good. His work on that on, on the primacy of beauty,

262
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,760
and then he talks about primacy, centrality, and ultimacy. And so I think truth is the ultimate

263
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,560
actually, and goodness is the, is the central, but I could, I could have a look around. But that's

264
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,480
because I have a slightly different notion of goodness is perhaps making me confused. So I'm

265
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,000
just admitting I'm confused. But the point, the point that I'm not confused about that I think

266
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,880
is well taken is to not, is to recognize that each transcendental is ultimate, but in a different

267
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,760
way. Each, right? So there's, there's firstness and there's centrality and there's ultimacy.

268
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,320
These are all superlatives, but in fundamental different ways. And just don't, so learn to

269
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:12,160
differentiate the different ways in which they're ultimate, but also learn to not confuse them

270
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,520
and give each one its proper due. It's profound. Yeah. And I, you know, just because of my background,

271
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:28,480
you know, I, my, my undergraduate degree is in art history and religious studies. My master's work

272
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,840
is working with my favorite Catholic theologian, Von Balthasar. So obviously,

273
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:42,480
yeah, you've got to read some Schindler. He is the person that has made Balthasar

274
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,480
like accessible and I think clearer. And also he's developed. David's just done amazing work

275
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,800
developing beyond Von. And I mean that in the way a good student goes beyond their teacher,

276
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,880
but he's gone beyond Balthasar in just profound ways. Of course. Oh, this is great. Okay. This

277
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,800
is great. I need, oh man. Okay. Yeah. Well, now I have something to do. I do want to say one thing

278
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,080
though, back to your question about, you know, where is the one and where does God come in an

279
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:21,280
office? Yes, please. This makes me a bad Catholic. I'm sure. And I'm, I'm worried about, sometimes

280
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,600
like, yeah, I always have a hard time. I always have a hard time trying to know, or I have a hard

281
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,440
time knowing where I fit in in these circles. I watched that video that you and Paul Bander Clay

282
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,240
and Jonathan Peugeot, and forgive me, I don't remember the woman's name. I had, that was the

283
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,280
first time I interacted with her virtually. What was her, what's her name? Who's on? You did,

284
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm sorry, let me give you the title first. On a Spiritual Home, it was on. Oh, that's Catherine.

285
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Sure. Yeah. And there was John Van Dink was there as well. Yes. Wonderful. Well, it's kind of funny

286
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,000
because, you know, as someone, I mean, obviously as someone who's Catholic, I still somewhat don't

287
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,240
feel that I have a spiritual home. And the reason why I preface this is this. In my counseling,

288
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:16,560
like, you know, my goal is never to make in life. In life, this is very hard to admit. I'm not

289
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,440
necessarily concerned with converting people to Catholicism. I don't think you should be when

290
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,840
you're in therapy. I think that's just, I think that's just. Even personally, I'm not necessarily,

291
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,360
you know, and I, and that's for my own personal reasons. And that's because, you know, I'm basically

292
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,280
not, I mean, I'm a cradle Catholic, but I'm also a revert. And I had, you know, a long bout with

293
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,000
atheism. And I, as I just expressed to you, I mostly studied Buddhist philosophy and undergrad,

294
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:54,880
and deep, deep compassion for anyone who has that proclivity. And so it's not my goal to make

295
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,280
any one Catholic, but it is my goal to, and I'm not a relativist, I want to make that very, very,

296
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:12,320
very. It is my goal, though, to unite the individual with the one God, right. And I won't

297
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,440
necessarily get into the, yeah, I don't understand what I just said was loaded, because then you

298
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,800
can, again, you can, oh, what is he saying that, you know, what he's, what he's saying is that

299
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,720
like a relative, relativist thought, and I don't necessarily want to get into my, my spirituality,

300
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:35,760
or, you know, things that I subscribe to, I really enjoy the more mystical teachings of Catholicism.

301
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,800
But yeah, it's never my goal to make anyone anything. My goal is the only, the only goal I

302
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,200
have is, like I stated before, is to help the individual pursue the path to eudaimonia, right.

303
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,440
And that's what I want to do. So I think that's a good clarification and specification. So let me

304
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,680
make my question more precise than my question is, well, I first of all, proposal, I propose that

305
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:13,600
getting people into right orientation towards the one towards ultimacy is how you can best help them

306
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,240
explicate, articulate, and respond to their, and here I'm being till it, their ultimate concerns,

307
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,360
and that part of what is underneath their confusion is very often they are confused about

308
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,560
what they ultimately care about. That's one part of the confusion. The other can be what is ultimate

309
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,520
such that I should care about it as ultimate is another thing that people are often confused

310
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,160
about. We often pursue evil, not because we're pursuing evil, but because we pursue a lesser

311
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:48,160
good at the expense of a greater good. Oh, amen. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So what I, what I meant was,

312
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,960
you know, how, yes, I get it, you're not proselytizing, you're not trying to surreptitiously convert

313
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,240
people. That would be duplicitous. I think it would be vicious in fact. But there's a sense in

314
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,880
which if what we're talking about, again, not, not the pathological people, but the deeply confused

315
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,240
people, we're trying to bring them clarity, then I think the orientation towards, you know, what's

316
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,720
real, what's most real, and how well connected am I to it is a fundamental question about meaning

317
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,440
in life. Of course. And that's where you're, I mean, and that's exactly where your specific

318
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,120
project comes in. And it's like, okay, but now how do I make this a psychological modality?

319
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,040
Right. I don't sit them down. Hey, in today's session, we're going to watch episode four of

320
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:35,520
the meeting. Of course. That would be utterly ridiculous. That sounds like a weird sitcom to

321
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:42,000
that could be done or something. Yeah. Right. Um, but it's again, it's like, yeah, how do I

322
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,880
distill? And again, I'm not, and you know this, you are not the only individual who has written

323
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:56,560
or thought about this extensively, right? So it's not just you. It's, it's, it's you in

324
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,360
accompaniment with other great thinkers. It's you in accompaniment with spiritual teachers. It's

325
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,720
you in accompaniment with simply just like already like empirically proven psychotherapeutic

326
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,120
practices, right? So it's like, and it's also in company with my, with my own, uh, with, with,

327
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:24,320
with who I am as a person, right? Yeah. So it's like, how do I put it? How do I, how do I get all,

328
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,680
all of us to converge? How do I, how do I create this tapestry of all these voices?

329
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:34,240
And that's what's difficult because it can't just be, right? So this is the thing. I mean,

330
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,360
counseling is not what we are seeing on YouTube, right? This is not, I mean, this is, this, this,

331
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,480
in a way, this is nice. Um, and I've had many counseling sessions where it has just been a

332
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,760
dialogue. Um, but how do we transform the dialogue? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's the question

333
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,160
that I'm, I'm, I'm struggling with quite frankly. I mean, so again, there's more skin in the game

334
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,200
because this is not just a theoretical, I'm not just like having this conversation with you,

335
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,000
just a, you know, kill an hour. It's like, no, this is quite frankly, like a livelihood that I

336
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,080
might have. Right. This is, this is also, this has economic implications, right? Yeah. I get it.

337
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,160
So it's like, well, what's the model that, what, what's the model? And so yeah, this is the thing

338
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,920
that I'm, I'm, I'm tirelessly thinking about every day. And it's like, yeah, I'm breathing a lot,

339
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,840
and I'm thinking a lot, and I'm reflecting a lot, and I'm watching a lot.

340
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,640
I want to know this when, when, like, I, I'm not demanding it now. I get it. It's a

341
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,720
work in progress. So, so, but, so don't mistake my, but like, I want, I like, I want to, I,

342
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,320
I want notes from the front or something. I want to know, like, how this is work,

343
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,200
how you are doing that, how you're translating that into, this is very important. I mean,

344
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,960
I mean, part of what the Verveki Foundation is trying to do is collect,

345
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,800
you know, relevant psychotherapists and counselors and philosophical counselors who can deal with

346
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,160
people who are wrestling with not just sort of the pedagogical struggles of taking on

347
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,480
an ecology practices, but, you know, a therapeutic slash existential dimension. So, you know,

348
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,960
let me interrupt you right there, even. So, I mean, part of it is also just not trying to reinvent

349
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,960
the wheel. Right. Yeah. We have, I mean, who the hell am I? Not, not that much, right? Who the hell

350
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,880
am I to say I'm going to create this new psychotherapeutic model, right? No. How am I going to have,

351
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,040
how am I, how am I going to personally put my ego aside for a second? And I'm going to submit

352
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,720
myself to the great thinkers, to visionaries of the past. And I, again, I, I interact with them,

353
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,840
and I transcend time and space, and they come into that session. So it's like, yeah, it's like,

354
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:55,200
how do we, okay, so part of it is I'm wrestling with kind of this hybrid CBT existential model,

355
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,480
because there is, because there, there, you do need to involve some type of cognitive behavioral

356
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,120
therapy. And of course, people reframing abilities, you have to. Exactly. Because you can give everyone

357
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,000
the existential jargon, and someone's going to say, you know, you, you can talk about, you know,

358
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,200
like I said, use I, you just throw out, like it's like a word box, like, oh yeah, I the relationship,

359
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,960
or yeah, whatever, like, you can't do that unless you have to first get the individual to a

360
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,200
place of insight, they weren't there. It wasn't there before, right? And the only way you can get

361
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:38,560
there is through the, you know, and we should be, we should be in, we should have much gratitude

362
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,200
towards the individuals who really developed the CBT model. And I do believe, you know, one thing,

363
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,240
it's funny, I talked about never knowing where my footing is, it's like, I, yeah, I tend to,

364
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:58,560
in the psychological circles, I tend to hang out with the more existential psychologists,

365
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,240
right? There's a lot of like good existential psychology happening right now. Even from,

366
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:14,320
you know, my institution where I'm at, Clay Rutledge over at Dakota, he's doing a lot of great work in

367
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,400
terror management and nostalgia and just more existential things that you could actually trickle

368
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,360
down to using that as like a therapeutic modality. But, so what I'm getting at is that you have the

369
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,280
existentialists on one side and just being like, sometimes it's weird how we just like groupthink,

370
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,240
they're like, no, this, you know, the people who subscribe to CBT, that's just a bunch of bullshit.

371
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,440
It's like, no, it's not just a bunch, I mean, it can't be a bunch of bullshit. It's not just that,

372
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,120
it's not that simplistic. And the evidence is the effectiveness of CBT is going down,

373
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,760
because as it's been abstracted and extracted from therapists who had a much broader philosophical

374
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,040
base and could bring in and address existential issues and sapiential having to do with wisdom

375
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,760
and virtue issues. Yeah, when you take it out, you abstract it, you just have it as a separate

376
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,440
method. Like it looks like it's effectiveness as an evidence-based therapy is actually going down.

377
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,920
There's a lot of reasons for that. And just like the, yeah, like, it's unfortunate how much

378
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,840
your basic, sorry, your average clinician who is working in the modality of CBT

379
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,760
might not actually have a keen of an eye. And they might not understand CBT. So what ends up

380
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,000
happening is you just, you go back to third grade vocab class and you just get a work.

381
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:49,200
I have a stronger critique. I think, yeah, yeah, it's, I think the way to address this

382
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,240
is that CBT and other people have said this, Robinson and others, CBT needs to be resituated

383
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:05,280
into, inside stoicism, which it was derived, because what needs to be offered is not a technique,

384
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,160
but the cultivation of virtue within the aspiration to a good life. And that's what's

385
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:17,280
missing from CBT as a framework right now. So I think CBT was more effective. You know, the people

386
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,800
who invented it were deeply educated with stoicism, right? And then that has fallen away

387
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,600
because of psychology's proclivity to forget its philosophical past.

388
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:34,880
Oh, amen. And that's why I said, that's why, you know, to get to the point or to get to the

389
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:43,280
genesis of this subconversation. Yeah, you have to bring in the existential psychotherapeutic

390
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,000
techniques are the most approachable of, you know, that side of the coin. So you do need to have this

391
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,040
blend of, you know, cog and existentialism. And you need to blend these two together. And I think

392
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:06,960
I personally think if this, if this enmeshing happens, then this is, then we can borrow that

393
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,840
and use that for this vision of counseling that I've been discussing.

394
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:20,720
Interesting, interesting. So I mean, virtues often have to do with two other things, emotions. So

395
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,760
I mean, I've done training also in EFT, Emotional Public Policy, and also inter-conflict and

396
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,720
inter-parts work by GIFS and other things are really good for learning how to also internalize

397
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,720
the dialogue inside the psyche and not always make it. So I'm wondering, do you think those

398
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,240
other two, I mean, I don't want to send you on an education. By the way, Joe, just, you know,

399
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,280
get educated on this for the next 20 years and then, but it seems to me, I guess I'm making an

400
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,440
argument. I agree totally with the proposal of integrating CBT and existentialism and therefore

401
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:07,040
getting something back to something like stoicism. But we also know, you know, stoicism and should

402
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,880
be put into dialogue with Buddhism because all kinds of evidence that combining CBT and

403
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,440
mindfulness together is synergistically helpful. Right. So I'm just wondering, like, is it, you

404
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,160
know, and then you want the inner dialogue work to overcome inner conflict and how to internalize

405
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,480
dialogue and IFS is good for that. And then dealing with emotions is a very, very important

406
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,720
part of call to virtue. I mean, Aristotle said, you know, it's not about being angry or not,

407
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,800
it's being angry at the right time for the right reasons to the right degree for the right person.

408
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:45,680
Yeah. And this is where, you know, a lot, you know, I'm even thinking about now and forgive

409
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,760
me if I don't directly answer your question, but now I'm just, you know, brainstorming and just,

410
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,600
again, they're not, they're not, again, please have compassion for me because they're not the

411
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,280
most, they're not developed thoughts yet because I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about this.

412
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,640
And so it's been like, you know, how, to what effect will, to what effect does psycho education

413
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,440
even have, like this type of therapy? It's like, you know, you said, I forget exactly,

414
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,440
I know you talked about mindfulness, but even just like the differentiation between teaching

415
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,360
someone what's the difference, the difference between mindfulness and contemplation meditation.

416
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,840
Meditation, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. So it's like, how often do we conflate these and we conflate

417
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,960
these and then we think that, and it's just confused. So if we don't understand the meaning

418
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,480
of words that we use, well, then we have, we don't understand our very selves because like,

419
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,680
the person is like a word. I mean, we are like letters. I mean, it's all these things are connected,

420
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,640
right? My friend Spencer Clayton, he writes about this in his newest book. And he talks about how

421
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,440
one thing that's been lost is the meaning of the meaning of words, right? I mean,

422
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,520
structuralists. So, you know, we think that words can mean whatever the hell they want,

423
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,920
but it's like, no, like these, these things, these symbols engender something, right? And,

424
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,200
and once we believe that they don't, well, then we get in a weird, really weird place. And, okay,

425
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,080
so how are we like letters then? Or how are we like words? Like, well, our forms engender something.

426
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,360
And if we believe that they don't engender something real or true, or how about this,

427
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:36,240
that we all engender possibly the same thing, getting back to the notion of the one to God.

428
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,120
But when we stop believing this, we get into really weird places. And it's so funny that you

429
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:48,880
brought up stoicism because I was thinking about how, you know, the Stoics naturally, and again,

430
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,920
even with the Buddhists, right? So the Stoics, what's, you know, you take a Stoic and you can

431
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,000
naturally start ushering them into the Christian ethic, right? It's so, it's, it's, it's a, it's

432
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,040
not easy, but you know, you do it via Neil Platonism. That's how you do it. Right. And so,

433
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,840
yeah, I mean, so, because, because in stoicism, it's obviously, I mean, people nowadays,

434
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,120
especially individuals who might be going to counseling, who aren't necessarily religious,

435
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,880
right? Taking those more Stoic practice, people are going to, people are going to automatically

436
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,240
feel more comfortable. Yes, very much. Yeah. Rather than if they begin to sniff that,

437
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
oh, what you're saying, I remember kind of hearing a very watered down version of that sometime in,

438
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:41,280
like, in Christian school, or that's mildly religious. Right. So, yeah, I, it's, yes, it's,

439
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,120
it's trying to be as approachable as possible. But no, you, when you were talking about, you know,

440
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,720
the regulations of emotions and trying to figure out, I mean, yes, that, I think that that very

441
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,600
much so is going to be a big part of this. Again, it's just like, and I, and part of this conversation,

442
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,800
which I didn't necessarily expect it to be, but I'm really happy it isn't, it's trying, it's trying

443
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:11,920
to talk with, you know, individuals. I mean, so I'm also talking next Thursday on a busy schedule.

444
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,960
Her name is Nancy Snow. I don't know if you're familiar with her work. Nancy Snow? No, sorry.

445
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,840
No, it's fine. And so I wasn't that familiar with her work either until just due my own

446
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,080
perspective. So Nancy Snow is now at the University of Kansas, but she previously was at the University

447
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:33,120
of Oklahoma. And so from 2000, from 2015 to 2018, Nancy in collaboration with

448
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,480
other academics in the psychological field, they held experience, experiments just on, like,

449
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:47,040
on this topic of virtue cultivation, how to, yeah, how to, and I'm so sorry, I don't have the exact

450
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,760
name, but you should look her up after this is Nancy, Nancy Snow. And what their goal was in

451
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:04,320
this three-year project was to discuss how you can use virtue cultivation. Can we make this,

452
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,560
can we give this like some empirical backing, right? Because no one in the psychological field

453
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,880
is going to care if you don't have empirical backing. Yeah. So yeah, part of it is having

454
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,560
conversations like with you next week, Professor Snow. And hopefully what I end up doing is

455
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,760
I, I take all these voices and I, like I said, I put everyone into accompaniment.

456
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,480
And, you know, maybe we'll talk in the future. I don't know. But I'd like to, I'd like to know when,

457
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,160
when you find your voice from all of these voices, I'd like to know what that was like,

458
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:48,160
and what, how you did it, and what is properly idiosyncratic to you and what is properly

459
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,800
charitable with other people. Yeah, it's very much like to know that.

460
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,880
Yeah. So we're, we're on the journey together, I guess, you know, we're, and that's, and that's

461
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:06,080
the really beautiful thing. So yeah, you know, and, you know, I did it. I, this, I'm kind of like,

462
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,520
you know, going off the path a little bit. I didn't want to ask you a question though that I've

463
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,880
been thinking about. I was just going to say, I think we should turn things over to you now asking

464
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:25,200
me questions. Okay, let's do that. Okay. So how about this? We'll probably stay on this path.

465
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,000
Well, I have a couple of questions I'm going to ask you about virtue and about play and about

466
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,040
male and female virtue. And I'm going to incorporate Jung in that. I'm going to incorporate play in that.

467
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:41,040
So I'll ask you some questions. But we're still going to be on the same. Yeah, if that's okay.

468
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,400
With all that being said, real quick, just to, just to answer the question,

469
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,840
what would you say is the gist of your intellectual project? Because you do so much.

470
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,280
What are you trying to, what are you really trying to,

471
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,280
what are you trying to achieve? What do you want people to take away?

472
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:17,040
I want people to recover, how to cultivate meaning in life and wisdom. So they have wise meaning

473
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:25,360
and meaningful wisdom, such that they can fall in love with beauty, truth and goodness, and

474
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,640
ultimately fall in love with being again, and continue to do so for the rest of their lives.

475
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:43,120
Real quick endeavor, right? I appreciate that. Thank you. And I will say, I mean, so

476
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,840
you're getting bigger and bigger. This is, I just thought of this question now, but you know,

477
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:58,480
and your pursuit is truly the most noble of pursuits. And your voice is being heard by many

478
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,280
and you're helping out a lot of people. Has that hit you yet? Is that hitting you now that you are

479
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,360
getting, that you, you're, you're gaining some type of what we would probably consider celebrity

480
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:14,400
status, right? You're, you're probably getting more into the public intellectual sphere, probably

481
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:23,760
that you ever thought you were ever going to get into, I'm guessing. Very, very mixed.

482
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:32,560
One part of me is deeply grateful and I take great pains to demonstrate and to

483
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,560
point out that there's, this is not me alone. This is very much a lot of people that I'm

484
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:45,760
collaborating with and in community with. So I'm very grateful for the recognition. I'm very grateful

485
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:55,520
for the, the collaboration. Very grateful for both of those. I'm very concerned, very concerned about

486
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:03,920
undertaking whatever, the exercise of whatever influence I garner to do it with as much

487
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,200
virtue and virtuosity as I can. So that's why I've set up and I've got, there's the, the

488
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:15,040
Viveki Foundation, which is a not-for-profit and there's Ryan Barton, who's the executive director

489
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,640
and Eric Foster from Upfire, the director of operations and there's people on the board

490
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,840
and so, right? And so there's, I have an arms length relationship. So the money and the recognition

491
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:35,280
is not right here. It's over there and it's, there's a lot of people who I selected very carefully,

492
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:44,000
who are very committed to a virtuous vision. And so, and I'm constantly looking for

493
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,920
feedback on how not to become a guru in the pejorative sense of the word.

494
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
Yeah. So that, that's hitting me.

495
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,240
Because unfortunately people will do that.

496
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,560
Oh, they will and I don't want to.

497
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,920
Yeah. And I really, really, really, really don't want to. I really don't want, I want,

498
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:13,600
I really am, I deeply aspire to being Socrates and I really, that is the most profound thing I want.

499
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:22,960
And I don't want anything to come at the expense of my aspiration to being as authentically

500
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,400
Socratic as I can. And, and in connection with that, although it doesn't sound like they're the

501
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,360
same thing, but they're connected, you know, all the, all the fundamental relationships that,

502
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:45,760
that I value for their own sake. So I don't want that. There's, I'm not, I'm socially phobic

503
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,760
by nature. This is a, this is a decade long persona that I have crafted that you're interacting

504
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:58,880
with, not inauthentically, by the way. I'm sure it aspirationally. But so I was talking to Ryan

505
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:07,840
last night about, I recently released a video on AI and the scientific and philosophical and

506
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,200
spiritual import of what's happening in AI right now. And it's, it's doing very well.

507
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:23,920
And, and so I get a sense of exposure that is quite unpleasant for me around that.

508
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:34,000
But, but if I hadn't done it, like I did that, I worked really, really hard,

509
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,360
like almost obsessively so for about three or three or four weeks before I released the video,

510
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,320
I say, because I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility. So it's not like I can't do

511
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:50,560
these things because of the exposure, because then I'm beset by a tremendous sense of responsibility

512
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,760
to the level of obligation, you know, about trying to do something, try to do whatever I can to steer

513
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,120
this towards the good for the sake of my family and my kids, my friends and for the world.

514
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,480
Yeah, right. But, but on the other hand, yeah, like, it's like, it's like, it's, it's like,

515
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,920
it's, it's, it's a negative affect of exposure that I also confront around it.

516
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,720
So techniques that you do to control your id from seeping into all of this. What do you, what do

517
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:34,240
you do to? Well, I have my, I mean, I do my daily ecology of practices, and which are do a lot about,

518
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,920
you know, that there's dialogical practices, imaginable mindfulness practices, you know,

519
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,800
body movement movement, the whole ecology, trying to design it, all the stuff I'm talking about,

520
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,720
designing a proper well, I enter into, you know, a dialectic into the logos, philosophical fellowship,

521
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,600
I do practices, I like my patrons are becoming like, we do, we do practices together, which is,

522
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,240
and I mean this, I mean this with respect, it's kind of like going to church together.

523
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,880
Yeah. And then, like I said, I know that we, we can't rely on self interpretation and self

524
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,160
direction, we have to engage it, but we can't rely on that for getting us to the good, we have to

525
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,520
make sure that there are people other than us, we nevertheless have our best interest at park,

526
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:26,560
who we have empowered, or also make it personal, who I've empowered to challenge me, to speak on me,

527
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:32,240
to keep me away from, so I don't, like for example, all the money doesn't come to me,

528
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,520
it goes to the Raveki Foundation, and then I will take out expenses for projects, and I also take out,

529
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:43,840
you know, a relatively small honorarium, because, you know, I should, this is a lot of my time,

530
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:50,000
and I like, I'm not generating income elsewhere that I could be doing, so it compensates for that,

531
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:00,960
but it's very much about putting in place also the external safeguards where there is specific

532
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,000
people who have been specifically empowered with specific duties to help keep me on track.

533
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,080
All of that can still screw up, but the more and more of this, I can make self organizing and

534
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:19,360
independent from my, you know, personal, my personal cognitive and emotional biases,

535
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,720
the better I think I can meet the demands which, and meeting the demands I do find very meaningful,

536
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:32,560
meeting the demands of doing this virtually, and with doing it virtuously and with virtuosity,

537
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,240
yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. That's beautiful, it's hard sometimes, you know, and

538
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:47,600
I am obviously nowhere near you, but as I, you know, I, this little podcast has allowed me to,

539
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:55,200
it's opened up doors, of course, it's allowed me to write for, you know, a publication,

540
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:04,480
it's allowed for me to have great conversations with you and other people, it's, I have, I mean,

541
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,320
I have my one, only one video and I don't ever want it to, because that was, I was very anxious

542
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:15,200
when I saw how many people were watching it, but one video was 40,000 views and I remember,

543
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,800
I was like, I remember like working out and I was at the gym and I was just clicking to see

544
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:28,720
how many people were watching it, and I was both flattered and both, I was getting egotistical

545
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,600
about it, but I was also extremely, I was growing extremely, you know, anxious over it,

546
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,640
and so it's like, in all this, you kind of, you get this false sense of gravitas, and so sometimes,

547
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,360
I know in my life, the people, you made that very clear and you made that beautiful point, it's like,

548
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:49,360
you know, you have the individuals, the friends, or the loved ones, the lovers, right, that, that

549
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:56,800
ground you, and it's like, well, oftentimes, now that I've been doing more, you know, sometimes that

550
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,960
gets, that gets into the way, that gets into the way, you know, sometimes with my relationship,

551
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:05,520
with my wife, maybe I'm working on something and, you know, my wife says, oh, look at the baby,

552
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,800
or, hey, you want to hang out, and it's like, well, I'm writing, or I'm collaborating, and so

553
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,560
that's on a teeny tiny scale, so I, you know, I can't imagine, you know, the,

554
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,160
how conscious you have to be, basically, on a moment-to-moment basis, which is good,

555
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,040
but it's also very hard in order to not deteriorate these relationships, and we don't have to get

556
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,000
into it by any means, I don't, I'm not asking you to- Well, I do want to say something about it,

557
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,040
I mean, I was, because I was talking to, I was talking to my life partner, I was talking to her

558
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:51,280
last night, and it's really interesting, I was saying how she actually becomes more and more real.

559
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:58,080
I said something to the effectist, as some of my, you know, dreams come true, I more and more find

560
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,200
the woman of my dreams to be more real, that's what's actually happening for me,

561
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:12,240
because the ephemerality of this, and again, please, I want to, I'm very grateful for the

562
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,200
recognition, I really am, and I'm not, I'm not being dismissive or insulting of it, but

563
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,720
sometimes, there's an old Greek proverb, that God sometimes punish us by giving us what we want,

564
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:31,920
right, and so a lot of these things that I, you know, I wanted more recognition,

565
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,640
I wanted my work to get out there, I wanted to make a difference, and you know, and to be really

566
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:44,080
honest, there's an egocentric, egotistical aspect to that, which- Always does. Yeah, well, I mean,

567
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:50,960
because, you know, if you totally get rid of the self-preservation strategy, you'll, you'll die,

568
00:59:52,400 --> 01:00:01,200
and so, but, you know, getting a lot of the success, as you said, I didn't really expect

569
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,880
the gas, although I'd always wanted it, you know, that weird sort of semi-fantasy thing that we all

570
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:16,240
were, getting that fulfilled has, and I don't want to come off as being saintly, because that is not

571
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:25,760
what I am or claim it to be, but it's, it's kind of, it's, it's salience diminishes in some important

572
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,120
way with respect to the things that are really mattering in your life, that's what I found,

573
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:37,440
I mean, I'm not saying this is universal, but, but for me, that's been helpful, it's like, wait,

574
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:43,760
you know, all of this is really cool and everything, but what's really happening phenomenologically is

575
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,440
that's sort of now more background for me, and my relationship with Sara, and like, and my kids,

576
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:57,680
and like, my friends, that's not really- I really do, I mean, I've only been a dad now for

577
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:06,800
a year and a half, but this, his birth and his life has coincided with this project of mine,

578
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,440
and kind of my, you know, this is my second career, I was a high school teacher, and then I had my own

579
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,960
meeting process for a while, and I kind of, this allowed me to, it jolted me back on this path,

580
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,320
and part of that jolt was my son being born, and the encouragement of my wife, and, but getting into,

581
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,960
and connecting what you were saying, yeah, I understand that he's actually more real now

582
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:40,240
than I ever have before, and I hope that as I grow and I develop in my pursuits, that actually allows

583
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:48,640
my boy to be more vivid to me, and my wife to be more vivid to me day by day, and it's beautiful

584
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:55,600
when these things mesh, and when our, you know, intellectual pursuit allows for our personal

585
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:02,400
pursuit to become more vivid. I hope so, I mean, I, at the end of my practices, I frequently pray

586
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,960
a prayer that Socrates pray, he prays it initially to, it goes something along the lines, a beloved

587
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:18,640
pan and all God to dwell in this place, give me the inward beauty, inward beauty, and let the

588
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,160
outward man and the inward man be as one, and I probably messed that up a bit.

589
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:36,720
Right, and, and, and, like, if, like, I hope, and I try, I put effort into cultivating the discernment,

590
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:42,720
I could see how people could be tempted for the reverse, the salience of the fame and other

591
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,520
things could actually cause that to be foregrounded, and the real things to be backgrounded, that's

592
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,120
obviously happened to be, yeah, tons of rock stars, and, right, no, exactly, right, the rock star

593
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:02,880
phenomenon, there's that. And I've also, I've also seen, I've also seen

594
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,160
that there's a temptation, right, right, I don't want to totally use that in religious sense,

595
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,280
but I don't want to ignore the religious sense either, so that's why I'm hesitating, but there's

596
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:22,080
a temptation, I can feel it, wait, this fame and this, you know, this fame and this wealth,

597
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,280
it's not as satisfying as I thought it would be, so the answer is I should get more,

598
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,400
I've felt that impulse come up to me, and it comes up from this Darwinian depth, right, wait,

599
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,480
the answer is go higher on the hierarchy, that's surely the answer, right, and it's like, whoa,

600
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:49,680
and I've noticed that too. So I'm trying to keep, right, I'm trying to, you know, be properly,

601
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:55,680
like mindful of them, not suppress it, but also not, not obsess about it, like get that golden

602
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:04,880
mean about it, so that I can hopefully not fall prey to that temptation. I would like to be,

603
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,520
if I could get what I wanted, I would like to be, you know, have a large enough audience

604
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:18,480
where people have to take me seriously, but not so large that people would start to idolize me,

605
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,640
that's where I would like to sit. That's the sweet spot. Yeah, that's the sweet spot for me.

606
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,120
I really do hope you get there, I think you are going to get there, because again, you

607
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,600
walk through this so precisely, and you can see it, like, you, I mean, in my opinion,

608
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:42,320
you don't, you never come off as disingenuous, you know, and even like with your conversations,

609
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:48,320
I mean, how, I mean, how I and how I'm sure many people approached you at first was through your

610
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:54,960
conversations with Jordan Peterson, and you never came off as disingenuine, you came off as real,

611
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,080
you came off as authentic, and I think that's why people ended up, you know, following you, and I

612
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:07,760
think there's, I don't know, I've never really, I mean, this is not a developed thought whatsoever,

613
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:14,000
and I think Jordan Peterson is on the same path, but there's obviously a difference between you

614
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,360
and Jordan Peterson, and I'm not just talking about philosophically, you know, I think Jordan

615
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:27,120
probably has a little more proclivity towards the pomp and pageantry of it all, and I don't think

616
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,040
that's not a shot, and I think that's actually, that's sometimes a very good thing, and you need

617
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:36,160
people like that, right, because you need people who also are going to talk to the, I mean, you said

618
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,160
you want to find that sweet spot, and people have different sweet spots, and there are some

619
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,400
individuals who just need to talk to the culture at large, right, and you need that, and sometimes

620
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:53,200
that actually makes you, or that is, it's then taken on the pomp and pageantry of that is actually

621
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,880
a necessity, though, because it's part of the game, so, but anyway, I mean, I think that's why,

622
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,600
I think that's why a lot of individuals have really linked up with your work, though, is because

623
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:10,080
it's, and I don't know the word to describe it, I'll be honest, I'll just say authentic again,

624
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,880
but, and so I think that's really telling that you admitted yourself that you want to find that

625
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,680
sweet spot, where you want to get big, but you don't want to get big, right, and I just think

626
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,160
that's really cool, to put it really cool, I know that's like, that's not the most profound, I just

627
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,520
think it's really cool, though. No, but thank you, thank you. Yeah, Jordan and I are different,

628
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:36,400
yeah, I mean, we have an interesting relationship, and of course it predates him becoming like a

629
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:47,440
superstar that he is, right, we aspire differently, I think Jordan aspires to being,

630
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,560
this is half the joke, and I think I've said this to his face and he laughed, so I don't think it's,

631
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,200
I don't think it's an appropriate, but he aspires to being Moses, I aspire to being Socrates,

632
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,880
and those are very different aspirations, because they're very different aspirations.

633
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:08,000
Right, and, and I agree with you, there are times when we need a Moses figure of a prophet

634
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,840
that will lead people to the prophet land, lead them out of bondage to the prophet land,

635
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:18,960
out of promised land, I think Jordan is, you know, I think both his virtues and his vices,

636
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,120
and I will admit that I have virtues and vices, so I'm not trying to, but I think both his virtues

637
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:31,360
and his vices orbit around that vision, right, whereas mine are around Socrates, and that's a

638
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:37,280
different vision. Oh, everyone has a mediator, right, I mean, everyone has a mediator, everyone has

639
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:43,440
that object of desire, and the sweet spot in life, right, just really quite, you know,

640
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,520
what Gerard would say is that everyone is going to have mediator, it's picking the right mediators,

641
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,520
that's what that's, that's exactly it, that's about, and that's the, that's the Socratic

642
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:57,680
prayer, I want that outward and inward to be resonant, and resonant, such that I, I, my life

643
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:09,120
is as virtuous as possible. I mean, try to manage these three things, virtue, virtuosity, and the

644
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:15,600
virtual is sort of what I'm wrestling with a lot, because they intersect and really interesting,

645
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,360
and on, and ways that haven't been very well articulated by previous people, because they

646
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:26,320
didn't have the virtual as the third in those three, which in it alters things, like you and I

647
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:30,720
would not be speaking like this without the virtual, what, how does virtuosity and virtue

648
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:36,320
show up here, and how does the, how does the, and the reverse, how does what we do in virtual space

649
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:42,880
translate back into the real space of virtue and virtuosity, these are important questions we

650
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,360
were wrestling with, right. No, I meant, and sometimes you got to, they're hard questions,

651
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,840
and I think precisely, and so they're so difficult that we're trying to actually

652
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,760
have these conversations function in the, in brick and mortar spaces, and so it's like,

653
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,840
I know that you are doing, you've been doing conferences, and that there's another conference

654
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:09,920
coming up, and me and my, me and my good friend, Marcus, who runs the channel more Christ, we have

655
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:18,080
an event coming up in DC with Michael Martin, and Paul Vander Clay, and, and, you know, we hope

656
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,840
our, our goal actually, one of our goals is that we plan our vision, Marcus don't get mad at me that

657
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:31,760
I'm talking about our vision, but our vision is, you know, we plan on having conferences, hopefully

658
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:36,800
multiple times a year, now Marcus is in Ireland, I mean, I'm in Cleveland, so it's obviously far away,

659
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:42,720
but if we could do like a European thing, and maybe an American conference, another thing that

660
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:49,840
we're thinking of is, you know, doing conferences, it's a conference camp, where a group of 15,

661
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:58,960
16, 20 people is actually a camping trip, right, and that, that, that projects you into a different

662
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:06,320
headspace, and conversation is, oh yeah, living with people is, is just important,

663
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:12,560
we, yeah, Ryan and Eric and I need to talk more about this, we're first doing lots of events,

664
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,360
and trying to get regular events going, and regular communities of practice, but we, yeah,

665
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:22,640
we need, we also need, we, we need to have retreats where people live together for a bit,

666
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:29,040
when I went on, we turned to the source last July, with Ray Kelly, living with these people,

667
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,760
and pushing yourself to the horizon of horror every day, for spiritual transformation,

668
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,920
as an impact on you. Joe, I've got a ghost on it, we've sort of shifted to you being

669
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,400
the host, is there any final thing you'd like to ask me before I leave?

670
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,480
There is, but I don't know how far we would get into it, but I'll pop it in there, maybe this

671
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:53,360
will leave us for a conversation in the future, really quick, why aren't you putting on this?

672
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:02,160
Physical beauty, is it beauty, are people's physical selves beautiful, or just not ugly?

673
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,560
That's to ask the question, if I were to answer it from like a platonic framework is,

674
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,880
yeah, came physical bodies, them and shine with beauty, yes. Beautiful, that was a question that

675
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,960
was on my mind, and I thought that was going to get me a one sentence answer, so you gave it to me,

676
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:29,200
I appreciate that. One of the most sensitive things in my relationship with my current partner is,

677
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:40,000
by objective measures, she's a physically attractive woman, but so I want that understood,

678
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,840
but I was really attracted first, and this had not happened to me before,

679
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,240
I was really attracted first, and I'll speak a little bit poetically, because it's appropriate,

680
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:57,520
I was first really first attracted to the beauty of her soul, and then I noticed in conjunction,

681
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:05,760
and as a function of that, I noticed how physically beautiful she is, and that has been really important

682
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:19,360
for me. That was like a, that was a wake up moment for me, and I think we have to be open to very

683
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,160
often, and you know, many people argue this played out famously, that we start with physical beauty,

684
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:32,000
and then we move to other, but it's happened that the reverse has been the case for me,

685
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:38,800
really importantly, and I just wanted to note that, I just wanted to note that, I think the

686
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:45,680
question of beauty is very much, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not unidirectional, is what

687
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:51,840
I'm saying, you can both be drawn through the physical to what is beyond, and what is beyond

688
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,440
the physical can reach to you first, and then draw you in attraction to the physical.

689
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,360
Yeah, all right, that's so true, it's, that like gave me goosebumps when you said that,

690
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,200
my wife is absolutely gorgeous, I would say she's absolutely gorgeous, and I would say by

691
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:13,680
side of me, she's absolutely gorgeous, but you know, there's always those times where every woman

692
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:18,560
and every man will get insecure, and you know, my wife sometimes asks me, you know, why, why me,

693
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,040
I tell her, because you really have the most beautiful soul that I've ever encountered in

694
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,080
my whole life, and you admitted the same thing, so I just think that's really, it's wonderful,

695
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:34,800
it's absolutely wonderful. Yeah, it is, it is, and yeah, I think that's a great, and I think that's

696
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,400
a beautiful place to end. Yeah, it is a good place to end, it is a good place to end, thank you,

697
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,520
Joe, this has been really wonderful. Yeah, thank you for having me. Oh, thank you for having me,

698
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:50,720
and I will send you a copy of this for your channel, and we'll talk again soon. Thank you so much, Jen.
