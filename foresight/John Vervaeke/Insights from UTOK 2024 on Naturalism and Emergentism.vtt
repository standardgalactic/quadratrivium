00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
Hello, everyone. The video you are about to see was originally recorded at the Utah 2024 conference.

00:07.200 --> 00:12.960
It's a conversation, a panel discussion with Greg Enriquez, Alexander Bart and Benita Roy.

00:12.960 --> 00:20.000
We get into some very deep discussions about transcendent naturalism and some convergences,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.400
contrasts, and criticism. I hope you enjoy the video.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.840
Alrighty, friends. First off, welcome. Good to see so many folks here.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.480
I'm just saying my heart tickled to have an opportunity to have this conversation

00:48.160 --> 00:53.120
with some of my very, very dear friends who have emerged in this space.

00:54.080 --> 01:01.040
And of course, John, who will be joining us in a second, has been really tremendously influential.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.240
It's been tremendously meaningful to connect with him. And I think since 2018,

01:06.880 --> 01:14.400
Bart and I hooked up 2019 in the Intellectual Deep Web. And I got to say there are few people

01:14.400 --> 01:20.480
in this world who are both more entertaining and more deep and more profound than John.

01:23.120 --> 01:28.160
Alexander Bart, his Intellectual Deep Web is inspiring, his way of being in the world,

01:28.160 --> 01:32.880
his vision across the breadth. Tyler Groke asked at the end of the last session,

01:32.880 --> 01:37.520
well, is Utah really encompassed everybody? And I was like, well, not somebody like Bart.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.480
Bart's are asked here on outside Utah, although I think they dance well together.

01:44.480 --> 01:48.880
So Alexander Bart, thank you so much for being here. I really look forward to dialoguing.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.200
And over the last couple of years, another dear friend of mine, Bonnie,

01:53.840 --> 01:58.800
we have explored. I've started to learn, I'm still an amateur, but it's starting to really get a grip

01:58.800 --> 02:05.200
on process ontology, on what true naturalism really means as opposed to the fake person that John

02:05.200 --> 02:12.160
and I are doing. And I'm really looking forward to sharing about the layers of metaphysics

02:12.160 --> 02:20.000
in relation. And so what we have today is then a very exciting exploration and discussion

02:20.880 --> 02:25.760
where we're going to be talking about transcendent naturalism. John and I will be representing that.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.880
Bonnie is going to bring her perspective, at least it sometimes is talked about,

02:30.880 --> 02:35.440
that is fierce naturalism. I'm not sure if that's still the term that she is using. Yes.

02:36.240 --> 02:42.560
And what that means. And then we have transcendent emergentism. And the title of our talk,

02:43.440 --> 02:48.640
and I think me and John and Bonnie are okay with naturalism. We'll explore that. We're going to

02:48.640 --> 02:53.520
get into what Bart feels about naturalism versus emergentism. And so we're going to be exploring

02:53.520 --> 02:59.840
the relationships and excavating the fault lines in relationship to these two sets of perspectives.

03:00.720 --> 03:09.360
And so here we are. If John's around, let me just see. Not sure if he's in yet or not in

03:09.360 --> 03:17.840
relationship to that. I don't know. He's still not quite. Oh, there he is. Hey, John, wonderful.

03:17.840 --> 03:26.320
Can you unmute yourself, friend? Can you unmute? Ask to unmute.

03:26.320 --> 03:33.680
Now I'm on mute. There he is. Okay. Woo-hoo. I think we're all here then.

03:34.560 --> 03:41.360
All right. So John, I just gave an overview introduction. Bonnie, Bart, Johnny and me,

03:41.360 --> 03:48.960
I need to say that once. We're going to explore. So what we thought we'd do today,

03:49.840 --> 03:55.760
in terms of basic order, is that John's going to kick us off talking, give us an outline of

03:55.840 --> 03:59.440
transcendent naturalism. Of course, John and I did a series on that. I thought we had a lot of

03:59.440 --> 04:04.320
excellent guests. We're going to wrap that series up with Lehmann Pascal and Bruce Alderman,

04:04.320 --> 04:11.120
who obviously will bring lovely things to summarize that. So we're going to start with that.

04:11.120 --> 04:16.720
Then Bonnie's going to give her take, explore a metaphysics that I think overlaps some,

04:16.720 --> 04:22.480
but also potentially critiques. And then Bart will bring his perspective. The last thing I'll

04:22.480 --> 04:26.960
say is, coming off of, obviously I mentioned last time, you talk emphasized the enlightenment

04:26.960 --> 04:33.040
gap coming off natural sizes. I look around today, you've got materialism, idealism and dualism,

04:33.040 --> 04:39.360
basically in the West. I think all of us would say, no, none of those are adequate. We need a new

04:39.360 --> 04:44.720
framework, a new philosophical framework for the 21st century and beyond, and it's time to start

04:44.720 --> 04:53.040
laying that down. So here we are. Let's get it rolling. John, if you would, take it away. I

04:53.040 --> 04:57.760
introduced you already, then I already told you what a brother-in-arms you are, this process,

04:57.760 --> 05:01.840
and how much I admire and respect you and your leadership. And that goes really for,

05:01.840 --> 05:06.240
certainly, Agent Bard and Benito, and I should have that already. So welcome, my friend.

05:06.800 --> 05:12.560
Thank you, Greg. And I'm looking forward to talking with you, Benita, and with you, Alexander.

05:13.280 --> 05:19.200
So, Greg asked me to give an overview of the argument. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible

05:19.200 --> 05:28.000
without leaving it with too many major gaps. I won't go over the argument in detail. I will

05:28.000 --> 05:33.680
often just refer to arguments that were made in detail in the previous conference presentation

05:33.680 --> 05:38.960
and on the series, Transcendent Naturalism. So Transcendent Naturalism comes out of two

05:38.960 --> 05:45.280
proposals. It comes out of the proposal of extended naturalism, plus a proposal of a kind

05:45.280 --> 05:50.400
of extended naturalism that supports strong transcendence, where that transcendence is

05:50.400 --> 05:56.160
not just psychological in nature, but has real epistemological and ontological significance.

05:57.200 --> 06:02.960
And there's two main arguments here. Each one is a meta-argument, a convergent argument,

06:03.360 --> 06:08.880
a convergent argument for a properly-leveled ontology, and then a convergence argument for

06:08.880 --> 06:13.760
a conformity theory of knowing. And then the proposal is, if you have a conformity theory of

06:13.760 --> 06:20.560
knowing with a leveled ontology, you can actually afford a strong transcendence. I will add to that

06:20.560 --> 06:25.840
something that I didn't make in the original talk, just a brief note on why that can be properly

06:25.840 --> 06:35.200
understood as sacred. So extended naturalism is the proposal that science, let's take what

06:35.200 --> 06:41.760
naturalism is standardly understood to mean, is that the natural sciences, that is where the

06:41.760 --> 06:48.320
naturalism comes, are those projects that dictate to us our fundamental ontology, our fundamental

06:48.320 --> 06:54.560
structural reality. Now that is usually interpreted without much justification as all of our ontology

06:54.560 --> 07:01.920
has to be derivable from the ontology of the natural sciences. And I argue that that actually

07:01.920 --> 07:09.360
doesn't make sense. You also have to include in naturalism everything that is presupposed

07:10.000 --> 07:15.440
in order to do science. Your ontology needs to include that, or you actually have a blind spot

07:15.440 --> 07:21.120
in your ontology. And that's the new book, by the way, by Evan Thompson, by Adam Frank,

07:22.080 --> 07:28.960
sorry, an astrophysicist, Marcelo Gleiser, a theoretical physicist, and Evan Thompson,

07:28.960 --> 07:33.920
a 4E cognitive scientist, and just some shameless self-promotion. The chapter on the blind spot

07:33.920 --> 07:39.680
within cognition explicitly talks about Vervecchi's theory of relevance realization as the blind spot

07:39.680 --> 07:47.520
within cognition. So yay, John. Okay, so anyways, the idea here is, if you do not include the

07:47.520 --> 07:52.320
standpoint from which you are doing science, then you actually have an incomplete and therefore

07:52.320 --> 08:01.040
incoherent ontology. And what I want to argue is, what does science actually presuppose? Well,

08:01.040 --> 08:08.320
it presupposes scientists doing science. And how do we work that? How do we have to extend our

08:08.320 --> 08:14.480
naturalism in order to include that? I take a look at three convergence arguments. One is from

08:14.480 --> 08:21.920
Blackowitz on what he calls the real difference. He argues that reductionism is based on the premise

08:21.920 --> 08:27.840
that only what is shared between things is ultimately real, that he argues can't be right.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.760
Real differences matter. Real differences are presupposed by real information. If there's no

08:33.760 --> 08:40.560
real information, there's no real intelligibility. And so you need real difference, which means

08:41.360 --> 08:49.760
you have genuine emergence. The next main argument comes from whole. And this is the idea that

08:49.760 --> 08:59.040
communication needs redundancy. Redundancy needs levels of reality to it. And causal signaling

08:59.040 --> 09:04.320
is a form of communication. And therefore you need real emergence. Again, I'm not going to go over

09:04.320 --> 09:09.600
these arguments in a way that is intended to make them persuasively convincing. I have done that in

09:09.600 --> 09:14.720
the previous talk. We did that at the intro to transcendent naturalism. I am just referring to

09:14.720 --> 09:20.080
them. You can go back and I'm going to take it that you're extending me the good faith,

09:20.080 --> 09:23.440
that there are persuasive arguments for each one of these claims.

09:25.440 --> 09:31.520
The third argument comes from the work of Yoraro, that science needs real structure.

09:31.520 --> 09:37.040
And she makes a distinction between bottom up causes that change actuality and top down constraints

09:37.040 --> 09:42.160
that shape possibility into potentiality. And science, of course, needs top down constraints.

09:42.160 --> 09:46.880
These are things like E equals mc squared, which are not events. They are real constraints,

09:46.880 --> 09:53.680
real structuring principles in reality. So so far, we need a leveled reality in order to get real

09:54.480 --> 09:59.120
information, in order to get real causal signaling, in order to get real structure.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.800
And then we have Smith's vertical causation argument, Volcker and Smith, which is the

10:04.800 --> 10:11.200
argument to the effect that the measuring device cannot be at the same ontological level as what

10:11.200 --> 10:16.480
is measured, especially when we come down to quantum entities. And so you need a real leveled

10:16.480 --> 10:22.640
ontology in order for measurement. So notice what science presupposes real information,

10:22.640 --> 10:29.120
real causal signaling, real structural principles. And it presupposes real measurement,

10:29.920 --> 10:34.400
integrating all of those together, all of those presuppose a leveled ontology.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.840
Vervecky makes a similar convergent argument that I made at Ralston at length,

10:41.040 --> 10:48.880
which is in order for us to do science, we have to include the scientist on our ontology.

10:48.880 --> 10:55.680
And that converges with everything I've just said. Why is it not just emergence up? The

10:55.680 --> 11:00.400
problem with just emergence up, and this is not just my idea. Many people have talked about this,

11:00.400 --> 11:06.000
is it gives you the level, the emergent level is epiphenomenal. It has no causal powers in its

11:06.000 --> 11:11.120
own right, or no constraining powers in its own right. The problem with epiphenomenalism,

11:11.120 --> 11:17.520
it's an oxymoronic term. It is a category for which we can find no non controversial members.

11:18.080 --> 11:24.800
And it presuppose, it indicates that something exists, but does not make any difference in

11:24.800 --> 11:29.360
reality and therefore is not knowable. I'm not going to go into that argument at length. I think

11:29.360 --> 11:36.080
if your, if your ontology leads to epiphenomenalism, it is a modus tolens. You have led to a reductio

11:36.080 --> 11:42.880
adipocertum. So you have to have real emanation and real emergence completely interpenetrating

11:42.880 --> 11:47.840
each other. You have a continuum. And when we talk about levels, all we're doing is picking out

11:47.840 --> 11:53.040
things that are particularly explanatorily, causally relevant. Whole has a formal proof

11:53.040 --> 11:58.800
that each level has a distinct set of causal powers to it. And therefore, when we're talking

11:58.800 --> 12:03.440
about levels, we're just picking out something that is most causally relevant to the particular

12:03.440 --> 12:09.840
kind of explanation. But that is not that it is just an epistemic convenience. The levels are

12:10.880 --> 12:18.960
epistemic conveniences that refer to a real emanation, emanation emergence continuum.

12:19.760 --> 12:26.320
Now, what about the meta argument towards a conformity theory? So the opposite to conformity

12:26.320 --> 12:30.000
theory is our current modern theory that knowledge is a matter of representation. I have something

12:30.000 --> 12:36.640
in my head that represents the world. Pickstock in her astonishing book, Aspects of Truth and

12:36.640 --> 12:42.720
New Religious Metaphysics from 2020 reviews all of the distinction arguments that are supposed

12:42.720 --> 12:48.880
to support the proposal of representational knowledge and shows that within analytic philosophy,

12:48.880 --> 12:53.920
itself, they have all been seriously undermined. The analytic synthetic distinction, of course,

12:53.920 --> 12:58.480
has been undermined by Quine, the distinction between a conceptual scheme and its content,

12:58.480 --> 13:03.520
by Davidson, the fact value distinction, and the is-ought distinction by Putnam,

13:04.240 --> 13:11.280
Case Beer, or Verveke has one that relevance is both a cause and a reason. And the theory data

13:11.280 --> 13:15.120
distinction by Quine and Duhem. So all of the distinctions that were supposed to

13:15.920 --> 13:21.440
open up the space between mind and world for which representation with the bridge was the

13:21.440 --> 13:28.240
bridge have been completely undermined. And what that returns you to is a conformity theory

13:28.240 --> 13:34.560
that the mind and reality are co-participating in shared principles of individuation,

13:35.280 --> 13:43.600
identification, intelligibility, and they're often mutually shaping each other

13:44.320 --> 13:48.480
all the way from these construction up to cultural world views.

13:50.160 --> 13:56.080
I also made an argument that cognition is all the cognitive sciences are converging on the idea

13:56.080 --> 14:03.040
that cognition is a dynamic continuum of emergence up and top down, bottom up, top down,

14:03.040 --> 14:12.400
completely into penetrating dynamically, realized processing. And if that was not tracking the

14:12.400 --> 14:17.600
grammar of reality, if that grammar of cognition was not tracking the grammar of reality, we would

14:17.600 --> 14:23.280
be facing a radical skepticism, a radical solipsism, because it would be that the mind in principle

14:23.280 --> 14:29.520
could not know reality, and we'd be into very deep Kantian problems, and I won't reveal all the sort

14:29.520 --> 14:34.880
of tensions and contradictions within the Kantian proposal. So we get a conformity theory.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.320
And then that links up with independent arguments within 4e Cogsai, launched by Gibson about the

14:42.480 --> 14:47.120
importance of affordances for perception and action and knowledge, Heidegger and the

14:47.120 --> 14:51.760
all aesthetic notion of truth that is deeper than the coherence or correspondence notion of truth,

14:51.760 --> 14:56.320
and Vervecchi's proposal that relevance realization is inherently transjective

14:56.320 --> 15:02.560
and binds the subjective to the objective together and is therefore more real. And all of these

15:02.560 --> 15:09.120
converge on a conformity theory of knowing. Now if you have a real leveled ontology and a conformity

15:09.120 --> 15:14.720
theory of knowing by knowing it, I know I'm not only engaging in psychological improvement,

15:14.720 --> 15:22.240
I'm actually knowing levels of reality that are otherwise inaccessible. And I am changing ontologically

15:22.240 --> 15:28.480
to different levels of the self that correspond through participation. Actually, I want to

15:28.480 --> 15:33.040
erase that sentence, levels of the self that participate with levels of reality.

15:33.040 --> 15:40.400
And so that is strong transcendence. It is making a fundamental epistemological and ontological

15:40.400 --> 15:47.760
difference, not just psychological hygiene and improvement. I would add to that the current

15:47.760 --> 15:53.600
work integrating the work of filler, who argues that pure relationality has to be ultimate because

15:53.600 --> 16:00.320
you can't get relations from Aristotelian substances. Of course, our science has pure

16:00.320 --> 16:04.240
relationality at the bottom and at the top and scientists are seeking the relation

16:05.120 --> 16:11.440
between the cosmological and the quantum. Nishita's argument that Aristotle's substance

16:11.440 --> 16:18.160
metaphysics, a substance is not stuff. A substance are independently existing objects, things.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.440
Aristotle's ontology, which we still fundamentally share, is that things are ultimately real and

16:23.440 --> 16:29.200
that relations and processes emerge from it. And that is tracked by a subject predicate logic.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.880
Nishita shows, you get Filler's argument that that doesn't work. Relationality is deeper than

16:35.360 --> 16:42.880
subject and predicate and deeper than substance and its properties. Nishita shows the Aristotelian

16:42.880 --> 16:48.720
metaphysics is inherently contradictory because it depends on predication, which is of universals,

16:48.720 --> 16:53.760
but its ontology claims that individual substances, individual things are most real.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.600
And this is the problem of how can the universals ever know the particular? It bedevils

16:58.400 --> 17:03.200
medieval philosophy until the Aristotelian framework collapses and you get nominalism,

17:03.200 --> 17:07.680
the proposed and what they do, what they decide to do is keep the substance ontology,

17:08.720 --> 17:13.200
individual things ultimately exist, but there are no real relations, no real patterns. They exist

17:13.200 --> 17:17.760
only in the mind. That's nominalism. That of course gives you a dualism because the mind is a

17:17.760 --> 17:22.320
fundamentally different kind of reality than reality. And then dualism gives you all the

17:22.320 --> 17:29.280
disasters of the meaning crisis. These are all arguments for abandoning a substance ontology

17:29.280 --> 17:34.880
and understanding that a no-thingness of pure relationality is what is ultimately real.

17:35.680 --> 17:42.800
Finally, making use of the work of the atheist Canadian philosopher Schellingberg

17:42.800 --> 17:47.760
about what do we mean by the sacred? He talks about the Tripoli transcendent and this lines up

17:47.760 --> 17:53.120
now with transcendent naturalism. The sacred is that which is ontologically ultimate. And of

17:53.120 --> 18:00.480
course, we can conform to and participate in the ultimacy of pure relationality. Neoplatonism and

18:00.480 --> 18:08.880
Zen both talk about this. Sodorological, it can transform you by entering into this relationship.

18:08.880 --> 18:14.480
Of course, you get fundamental transformation of human beings because you're engaging in strong

18:14.560 --> 18:21.040
transcendence. It saves you, it liberates you, it frees you in epistemologically and ontologically

18:21.040 --> 18:27.040
significant ways, not just psychologically. And it's axiological. It gives you a reciprocal

18:27.040 --> 18:32.560
opening relationship as you get the ground of the self is opening up to the ground of reality.

18:32.560 --> 18:38.400
And they are ultimately non logically identical because they are co-realizations,

18:38.400 --> 18:46.160
co-participations in the dynamic realization of pure relationality. And that that reciprocal

18:46.160 --> 18:54.560
opening gives you a capacity to fall in love and to involve the whole of the self without

18:54.560 --> 19:01.280
in any way being self involved. And this is would be a touchstone for all other normative

19:01.920 --> 19:07.200
evaluations. So it would be it would be axiologically transcendent. I can develop all

19:07.200 --> 19:13.440
of those arguments in greater detail if needed. So transcendent naturalism puts us into a

19:13.440 --> 19:20.080
participatory relationship with ontological ultimacy, sodorological ultimacy, axiological

19:20.080 --> 19:26.640
ultimacy. And that means it is also sacred. So transcendent naturalism gives an account

19:27.280 --> 19:35.120
of sacredness and ultimate reality that is nevertheless still consistent with naturalism.

19:35.680 --> 19:42.320
But that naturalism has to be extended naturalism. That's the gist of the arguments and some

19:42.320 --> 19:46.480
recent additions I have made to them. So thank you very much, everyone, for your time and attention.

19:47.760 --> 19:55.360
Wonderful. Thank you so much. And so I think that's a brilliant and crisp summary of the core

19:55.360 --> 20:00.800
tenets. Christian put it in the group and I mentioned that John and I have done the series.

20:01.360 --> 20:05.760
It brings in a number of different thinkers. I'm not going to get into it now because I did a

20:05.760 --> 20:10.800
review of you talk and certainly have raised some questions. But let's just say what John just laid

20:10.800 --> 20:17.120
out is a ball from Roy Bashkar and say there's a philosophical under laboring, a richness,

20:17.120 --> 20:21.920
and of course then extending into modern cognitive science that fits sort of with

20:21.920 --> 20:26.960
you talk and sort of a lock and key. I am not a philosopher by training in relation. I got some

20:26.960 --> 20:33.840
notions, but the ways in which you talk is structured as we've dialogued is fundamentally

20:33.840 --> 20:39.760
consistent and I think affords certain kinds of elaborations on what John was talking about.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.440
But I'm not going to get into that because we're really talking fundamentally about these different

20:43.440 --> 20:48.960
positions. What I want to do now is turn the discussion over to Benita Roy so that she can

20:48.960 --> 20:55.200
share her perspective on naturalism, what John offers, and what she brings to bear in relation.

20:57.760 --> 21:03.760
Benita Roy, can you, you can unmute. There you go.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.640
Woman's worst nightmare.

21:10.320 --> 21:14.640
First I want to thank John and Greg and all their guests because I've watched many,

21:14.640 --> 21:23.040
many hours of their transcendent naturalism series and I really like season two. I think

21:23.680 --> 21:28.960
it was, you know, you designed it so there's a lot of shake ups and different ideas and stuff

21:28.960 --> 21:36.400
coming in and I think you brought in the problem and showed that there's a real critical importance

21:36.400 --> 21:44.720
to this, but also that it's not easy. I don't think any of us think it's easy. So I'm glad that

21:44.720 --> 21:53.840
John ended with Axiology because for me, why does this all matter? I think where the rubber hits

21:53.840 --> 22:02.880
the road is that if we could come up with a system that is transcendent naturalism that really helps

22:02.880 --> 22:09.680
people close the gap between the is and the ought, I think that this would be its biggest

22:09.680 --> 22:16.640
contribution as we struggle with science and the psyche and idealism and reductionism and stuff.

22:16.640 --> 22:21.520
This is kind of like the path toward that, but I really think that the goal,

22:23.200 --> 22:27.280
one of the huge goals would be the axiological goal.

22:30.880 --> 22:38.000
I want to start with a quote and the quote is to remind us, I think we all can agree with this

22:38.000 --> 22:43.360
quote, but we're here on line and we're going to do a lot of talking and use a lot of words,

22:43.360 --> 22:50.720
but I just want to honor the fact that for me and I assume for you that this is a constraint

22:50.720 --> 22:57.520
and that we're after something that's really personal and sacred to us and meaningful to us

22:57.520 --> 23:01.840
personally at a deep level. And so the quotes from Warren Heidi and he writes,

23:01.840 --> 23:08.560
how should one live? Not by painstakingly constructing a linguistic replica of a corner

23:08.560 --> 23:14.720
of the cosmos and then running repeatable experiments and quantifying the results,

23:14.720 --> 23:20.080
but by carefully reflecting on what we are and what living well means for us.

23:20.960 --> 23:27.840
So I think the journey often looks like constructing a linguistic replica of the

23:27.840 --> 23:33.520
corner of the cosmos. I think those are the tools that we use, but I just want to remind

23:34.160 --> 23:38.400
us that I recognize in all of us that that certainly is not our goal.

23:42.240 --> 23:48.400
I don't really have a model or a system or an argument to make. I want to introduce some tools

23:48.400 --> 24:00.480
that I think are useful in this project. And one tool is metaphysics. And my definition of

24:00.480 --> 24:08.160
metaphysics amongst many others is I think that the purpose of metaphysics is to distinguish

24:08.160 --> 24:19.200
the true from the real. Now, we have to define those very precisely and there's many different

24:19.200 --> 24:25.840
ways to define them. But the way I am meaning about that is kind of like what Baskar talked about,

24:25.840 --> 24:35.600
science deals with the actual and not the real. And so for me, the true is what science can get at.

24:36.320 --> 24:45.200
And I define science as the set of protocols that lead to actions, the set of protocols

24:45.200 --> 24:52.000
that lead to outcomes predicted by theory. And so science is in a box, a methodological box,

24:52.000 --> 25:00.000
it has a lot of constraints, and it can create true theories. But this is quite different from the

25:00.000 --> 25:05.280
real. And I'll talk a little bit about more about that later. But I think that and these are words

25:05.280 --> 25:11.440
you hear, you know, John, John is talking about real, the transcendent as dealing in the realm of

25:11.440 --> 25:17.680
the real and not the realm of the actual as Baskar would say, or their or the true. So I think

25:17.680 --> 25:30.400
that's an important tool to look at. I want to talk about stratified reality. And stratified

25:30.400 --> 25:36.480
reality is what we do when we say there's information energy and matter and then mind and then mind to

25:36.480 --> 25:42.480
and life and this and that. There's, you know, you go different cultures and different periods of human

25:42.480 --> 25:51.600
history, and people would not have organized the ontological stack that way. And so I was

25:51.600 --> 26:01.760
thinking this morning about where in our evolutionary history, pre human, did we still, we first

26:02.640 --> 26:10.240
encounter this ability to create ontological stacks. I mean, chimpanzees aren't running around

26:10.240 --> 26:16.160
creating ontological stacks, people are. But because I think I believe in the continuity

26:16.160 --> 26:23.120
of the animal mind with the human mind, I'm thinking this morning, where, where can I find

26:23.120 --> 26:30.240
the earliest template or the feeling sense of this kind of activity. And I thought about how

26:30.240 --> 26:38.160
animals will reduce a complex puzzle into parts. They do this. And, and so these are different

26:38.160 --> 26:42.640
steps of action. So I want you to think about what, you know, this is what John said,

26:42.640 --> 26:47.680
what is the standpoint from which we are doing this? What is the standpoint from which we are

26:47.680 --> 26:56.000
creating stratified reality? And so I want you to feel into this sense that, okay, it starts in our

26:56.000 --> 27:02.400
pre evolutionary history and our animal nature of reducing, reducing is not the right word because

27:02.400 --> 27:08.880
reduces like a bad word or, or separating or distinguishing or discerning a complex puzzle

27:08.880 --> 27:14.960
into parts. As far as I can see, that's the first instant. And then this is what's fascinating.

27:14.960 --> 27:22.800
This carries on with early man into toolmaking. And the fact that we can teach toolmaking through

27:22.800 --> 27:27.280
a series of steps, and there's a series of parts. And then this starts this whole

27:28.240 --> 27:36.720
evolutionary advantage, I think is what we are doing when we're, we're, is where it all started.

27:36.720 --> 27:43.120
And then now I want to reflect on something and that is breaking into parts has always been a

27:43.120 --> 27:50.720
protocol for problem solving and making. But only recently has it become a protocol for getting at

27:50.720 --> 27:58.400
what is real, meaningful, or for moral choice. Now, I don't know what to make of that statement

27:58.400 --> 28:04.560
because that was my insight this morning, driven by, you know, the, the energy of the

28:04.560 --> 28:14.400
participation of this panel. But it's something to, it's something to think about. And maybe that's

28:14.400 --> 28:22.480
a good thing because maybe we are this, we're doing a problem solving thing. But maybe, maybe

28:22.480 --> 28:30.800
there's something that needs to be converted there. Okay. However, given that, I'm going to talk about

28:31.360 --> 28:38.800
what people do when they do stratified reality. And there's something very interesting. There's

28:39.280 --> 28:48.880
there's a tendency to make a mistake. And that is, if we say, let me just give you an example. So

28:48.880 --> 28:54.080
if I say, what is pizza made of? Okay, and you can say, well, pizza is made of dough. And then I

28:54.080 --> 29:00.480
say, what is dough made of? I mean, you say dough is made of wheat. This presents a simplistic and

29:00.560 --> 29:12.560
reductive sense of what is going on. Because the pizza is made of dough, but all but made with

29:13.200 --> 29:18.560
the people who, you know, proof the dough, the cook who's doing it and the oven that's cooking it

29:18.560 --> 29:26.720
and the oven, and blah, blah, blah, all of this, the with the with is lost. The with are all these

29:26.720 --> 29:36.000
verbs that don't survive the analysis. Okay, then we can say, well, what is dough made with dough made

29:36.000 --> 29:43.760
is with made with wheat and the agricultural revolution, which is made with human evolution,

29:43.760 --> 29:51.040
which is made made with the genealogy of the earth. And so one of the things that happens when we

29:51.040 --> 29:57.360
ontological stack along categories is all the with is gone. And all and it's kind of like the

29:57.360 --> 30:03.600
physicists that when they say, well, 97% of matter and energy, we can't get our hands on.

30:04.240 --> 30:11.680
And so there's something about this enterprise of categorization, stratifying reality that loses

30:11.680 --> 30:17.360
all the with. So that's the first thing I want to point out. And I only want to point out really

30:17.440 --> 30:26.560
one other thing. And that is, if you notice, as you go down, here's pizza.

30:27.840 --> 30:34.160
Here's dough. Here's pizza and a whole bunch of cooks and stuff in the and the fact that you

30:34.160 --> 30:41.040
bought the flour. Okay. And then here's dough and dough is made with wheat. As I go down,

30:41.040 --> 30:50.640
the systems that are left out become larger, not smaller. So Sabina Hobson Felder has this

30:50.640 --> 30:56.000
strong critique against physics and so does Eric Weinstein. And it's part of it is this problem.

30:56.640 --> 31:02.720
Because if by the time you get to matter, and then you get to sub atoms, and then you get to

31:02.800 --> 31:12.000
subatomic particles, the Higgs boson is made with the whole scientific enterprise across all of human

31:12.000 --> 31:19.440
history, and the politicians and the money. And she's recent Hassan Felder's recently come out

31:19.440 --> 31:24.960
and said, there's a real problem with the scientific enterprise. And this problematizes

31:24.960 --> 31:32.000
something like the Higgs boson. And so this sense that the lower you go down, the more is actually

31:32.000 --> 31:41.920
has to be included to justify the simple thing you are saying exists in this category of reality.

31:41.920 --> 31:53.440
So I just want to add those. I haven't put it together. And I'm hoping that bar is up for the

31:53.440 --> 31:58.480
challenge. Thank you very much for your time. All right. Thank you so much, Benita. I took some notes.

31:58.480 --> 32:03.120
So what we're going to do, certainly after I'm going to hand it over to Bart, he's going to offer

32:03.120 --> 32:08.000
one thing I will say. I hope for our conversation is naturalism, emergentism,

32:08.000 --> 32:13.040
contrast, maybe Barbara will bring that. I found a lot I resonated with and what Benita said,

32:13.040 --> 32:16.480
some questions that I had. I look forward to jumping in those. But we're going to hand it off

32:17.680 --> 32:25.600
to Alexander Bart and let us have it, Bart. I'm kind of shocked at how much we agree.

32:25.760 --> 32:34.000
But I knew we would probably. But I think there's there's also a lot here in the nuance. And Benita

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
and I, I'm going to do the sales pitch right away. It's done because it's fucking working.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.840
It's not profit, by the way, it's pros and it came out last year. And I realized I had to do

32:43.840 --> 32:47.600
metaphysics when I wrote this six book of mine. I had to do it. I had to sit down and do metaphysics

32:47.600 --> 32:53.120
because the way we did human history could not be explained unless we had, you know, an understanding

32:53.120 --> 32:56.960
of how we do universal history. So I had to go down to the dirty work of actually going into

32:56.960 --> 33:01.440
metaphysics for the book. Bonita and I had wonderful conversations this fall already. I really

33:01.440 --> 33:07.440
look forward to continue those. So I'm here with Bonita against John and Greg's. You know,

33:07.440 --> 33:12.400
it's Abba again. I'm Swedish. It's like Bjorn and Benny against Anne and Fred Magnetta. But it's like,

33:13.360 --> 33:17.760
but we had wonderful conversations. She gets the book and I really appreciate Bonita. She gets the

33:17.760 --> 33:22.400
book in the sense that I'm the son of Hegel and she's the daughter of Whitehead. You know,

33:22.480 --> 33:27.760
and I've always found Hegel and Whitehead to be scaringly compatible with each other. Hegel being

33:27.760 --> 33:33.520
still not understood in the Anglo-Saxon world, basically, because we were all blinded by the

33:33.520 --> 33:38.080
enormous turn with the amount of account to the content turn it's called in contemporary philosophy.

33:38.080 --> 33:42.080
But what happened was that only a few years later in Germany, there was another shock, at least

33:42.080 --> 33:46.080
on our part with the content turn, which is the Hegelian turn. So I will return to Hegel and bring

33:46.080 --> 33:50.800
that into the conversation because a lot of what John is asking for. And I totally agree.

33:51.680 --> 33:55.920
We have to do this turn and get out of the metal crisis. But actually, the work was done

33:56.640 --> 34:01.520
by Hegel and Nietzsche in the 19th century. It's precisely by reading Hegel and Nietzsche through

34:01.520 --> 34:06.400
each other. I worked on this for 30 years. I think we can see that there was a turn here. There was

34:06.400 --> 34:12.400
a turn away from dualism. The last dualism was, of course, a modern kind onto a modest worldview

34:12.400 --> 34:18.320
where the obsession is with difference. Okay. So everything relates to everything else in the

34:18.320 --> 34:23.440
universe. And I totally agree with John. Epiphenomalism is just the dead end because, obviously,

34:23.440 --> 34:28.160
my thinking relates my physicality to it. It's just all the different things that

34:28.160 --> 34:35.120
exist affect everything else. So what we did in the book, there were two things. One of them is that

34:35.120 --> 34:39.440
we realized that three of the philosophical disciplines that I'm a philosopher, I'm not a

34:39.440 --> 34:44.160
scientist. When I'm a scientist, I'm an economist, which I will totally leave out of this conversation.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.960
The economist Alexander Barj, you don't get seen today. But I'm a philosopher and an artist. So

34:48.960 --> 34:54.080
allow me to be, if possible, maybe we might need to hear even more of the philosopher. And then

34:54.080 --> 34:59.680
Greg and John, who are fantastic scientists, can stay with the size. But my pointer is that we needed

34:59.680 --> 35:04.640
to look at the philosophical disciplines themselves. So being tired of doing ontology, because I'll

35:04.640 --> 35:08.640
actually find ontology to be quite easy. There's ontology and there's ontics. Essentially, that's

35:08.640 --> 35:12.720
what happened after Kant. So then everything starts moving and everything is relational,

35:12.720 --> 35:17.520
and that's Hegel. From Hegel, through Nietzsche, on to White Ted, and on to the last, we have

35:17.520 --> 35:21.680
realized that everything is relational fundamentally. All this very difficult to think

35:21.680 --> 35:27.360
relationalism, it's absolutely necessary. The object out there is a byproduct of the relation.

35:27.360 --> 35:31.440
There are a lot that comes after the relation. So I think we all agree on that. But Hegel did

35:31.440 --> 35:35.520
too. The thing is with Hegel, he stopped in his dialectical method. He just said that no,

35:36.080 --> 35:42.320
there is no fixed point anywhere in the universe ever. There are no, there's no individual. I

35:43.280 --> 35:47.440
am many different people. I was a different person yesterday than I am tomorrow. By the way,

35:47.440 --> 35:51.680
I die all the time and I'm born all the time. Divigiality is the normal state of things for us

35:51.680 --> 35:56.080
to be human. So this was already Hegel because with his dialectical method, there is no fixed

35:56.080 --> 35:59.440
point. You must imagine that you live in the universe where you're not allowed to have fixed

35:59.440 --> 36:05.120
point unless you know you're only having a fixed point to use it to then try to understand something.

36:05.120 --> 36:09.600
So it's like you borrow into that fixed point and that's called negation in Hegel. So what we did

36:09.600 --> 36:16.240
was that we took ontology, epistemology and phenomenology and threw them all into one big

36:17.680 --> 36:22.320
big mess, which is what Hegel actually did. What he said was basically that ontology and

36:22.320 --> 36:28.000
epistemology and phenomenology are in themselves all three, three relational siblings in the world

36:28.000 --> 36:32.000
of philosophy. And he started doing ontology and epistemology at the same time, which is how

36:32.000 --> 36:36.400
we overcame Kant because in Kant, they were separate. And suddenly with Hegel, it's just

36:36.400 --> 36:40.640
like he cracks jokes at Kant all the time. He's just like, no, no, no, Kant. It's not like there's

36:40.640 --> 36:45.120
a phenomenon there and there's a numinal there because actually you are engaged and involved

36:45.120 --> 36:50.480
with the numinal. So we call it phenomenology, just to crack a joke about it. Hegel constructed

36:50.480 --> 36:56.400
phenomenology. So the thing was that by doing this and calling it narratology, I think we

36:56.400 --> 37:00.400
come down to something that we can agree on is basically very human. Because in Hegel,

37:00.400 --> 37:04.320
there's a subject and there's a substance. And it's a sub-relationship to the substance,

37:04.320 --> 37:08.800
which is what philosophy is all about. There's always human subjectivity constantly returning

37:08.800 --> 37:12.480
in Hegel. And whenever you try to come up with anything without you being involved with the

37:12.480 --> 37:18.880
world, Hegel says, no way. That's cheating. Back to you again, because you are involved as philosopher

37:18.880 --> 37:23.600
or as partner of the philosopher or as you believe you are involved in the world and we are humans.

37:24.400 --> 37:31.280
Philosophy is a human endeavor. So narratology enabled us to say that this is the trick with

37:31.280 --> 37:37.440
dialectics. Always have a three. So if you want to spice up your sex life, bring a third person

37:37.440 --> 37:43.280
into the bedroom. I highly recommend it. This is very Hegel. What Hegel does is that no, dialectics

37:43.280 --> 37:49.200
is not the dichotomy in opposition between two points. Like if you are young, you must split

37:49.200 --> 37:53.920
either the young or the young. And Taoists actually do that, Bonito probably agrees, by splitting on

37:53.920 --> 37:57.600
the young side. Always take the masculine side to make the split there because men are so fucking

37:57.600 --> 38:01.680
scared to get away, women are not. So you split on the side and say there's young and the young

38:01.680 --> 38:06.400
within the young. And then the young is opposite the young. This is how Hegel works all the time.

38:06.400 --> 38:12.640
So by using ontology and epistemology and phenomenology as three philosophical discourses

38:12.640 --> 38:18.000
and then saying they're all three interconnected one another. And this is the Hegelian absolute.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.800
The Hegelian absolute is to recognize that and to recognize there is no fixed point

38:23.360 --> 38:29.920
and using vocabulary from the Greeks, we then say that there's a logos and there's a pathos and

38:29.920 --> 38:35.440
there's a mythos. Human beings have three different ways of describing reality or describing the world

38:35.440 --> 38:39.440
that makes sense of the world. They use a logos, use a mythos and use the pathos. And science,

38:39.440 --> 38:44.400
of course, is on the side of logos fundamentally. Pathos is just our emotional lives, our feelings

38:44.400 --> 38:48.560
and blah, blah, blah. There's no such thing in AI, by the way, electricity is not blood.

38:48.560 --> 38:52.240
Put it that way. The pathos is incredibly human, animalistic, whatever, you know,

38:52.240 --> 38:56.320
all the forces inside of you, the force of nature, pathic, pathical narratives,

38:56.880 --> 39:01.440
you know, news, a cast, pornography, anything that's brutally real thrown at you is a pathical

39:01.440 --> 39:06.480
narrative. And then there's mythos and mythos is actually as often Hegel to go between,

39:06.480 --> 39:11.280
meaning that since logos and pathos can never be unified in themselves as logos or pathos,

39:11.280 --> 39:19.120
you have to invent a mythos. And this is the temporary story about ourselves that human beings

39:19.920 --> 39:25.120
have to create all the time to make sense of the world. So Hegel allows us to have a temporary

39:25.120 --> 39:30.000
platform, which we agree, at least now we can agree, we have a paradigm, we have a certain

39:30.000 --> 39:35.040
historical period, we agree on certain values, we create a society together and off we go, right?

39:35.040 --> 39:39.600
So to create that temporary platform, the mythos about ourselves currently in the digital age

39:39.600 --> 39:44.400
with AI arriving and climate change and everything to arrive at a mythos is what we need. The meta

39:44.400 --> 39:49.520
crisis is a lack of a new mythos. It's a nihilistic state where the old mythos is dead.

39:50.320 --> 39:54.560
It's it's not a death of a God, it's a death of a paradigm and a new paradigm has to be

39:54.560 --> 40:00.160
stored and we're in between paradigms for the most. Okay, so this moves us on to metaphysics.

40:00.160 --> 40:05.200
So what kind of what kind of implications does this neurological model have for metaphysics?

40:05.840 --> 40:12.000
What it means that like you guys, the three of you here, I hate reductionism, reductionism,

40:12.000 --> 40:17.280
most silliest thing ever. Bonita just pointed out perfectly so simply by reducing the pizza to

40:17.280 --> 40:22.400
the wheat is idiocy, right? The problem is that I don't know why, but especially the computer

40:22.400 --> 40:26.880
scientists to make all the technology they are all reductionist and they tend to go to either

40:26.880 --> 40:31.600
reduction down to the so sort of simplest monad which where apparently the entire history of

40:31.600 --> 40:36.000
the universe is preprogrammed or something. They go all the way down to reduce everything down to

40:36.000 --> 40:39.680
some kind of atom, which would then explain everything else that happens afterwards because

40:39.680 --> 40:44.800
everything is then deterministic from that point, which I totally disagree with. But they also go

40:44.800 --> 40:48.800
the other way and said, well, I'm conscious and there's consciousness is in some center of the

40:48.800 --> 40:52.560
universe. And I'm a fucking narcissist. And because I'm a computer scientist, just made

40:52.560 --> 40:57.680
billions of dollars. Therefore, everything has to be about me. So everything can be reduced

40:57.680 --> 41:02.640
to a consciousness. All I tell those guys is that here is a rock, go and cuddle with a rock,

41:02.640 --> 41:05.920
have sex with the rock and talk to the rock, not with me apparently because the rock has

41:05.920 --> 41:11.520
consciousness and you can talk to it, right? And off they go. So reductionism is the enemy,

41:11.520 --> 41:16.080
but it's being this difficult to get rid of reductionism. I know all you guys here in the

41:16.080 --> 41:20.560
thread say, oh, relations, yes, of course, relations prior to a lot of our own relations,

41:20.560 --> 41:25.360
you have no idea of difficulties to actually sit down and try to do relationalist philosophy.

41:25.440 --> 41:30.640
This is why two geniuses like Hegel and Nietzsche and White Ted to do it. And it's really,

41:30.640 --> 41:37.280
really hard. But okay, but if you try to do it, you got to remove all those things out there

41:37.280 --> 41:42.960
where you lose track. So what I'm proposing is that I'm sorry, but the word nature is just

41:42.960 --> 41:48.480
the opposite of culture. And I'm defiant here. Nature is not superior to culture.

41:49.360 --> 41:55.040
The just different emerges as nature emerged and culture emerged. And like Greg probably

41:55.040 --> 41:59.680
graced me, they're equal. If you're going to do metaphysics, don't do don't do axiology,

41:59.680 --> 42:03.520
we do metaphysics, leave axiology, you can do that later. It can be its own fourth story,

42:03.520 --> 42:07.280
whatever, leave axiology, just try to be as neutral as you can, try to describe how the

42:07.280 --> 42:11.280
world functions. That's all you try to do here philosophically. That's metaphysics. So you say,

42:11.280 --> 42:18.880
okay, so where do I start them? Well, here's the great thing, Bergson. Bergson said, why is everybody

42:18.880 --> 42:23.360
obsessed with why there's something rather nothing? Because that's just interchangeable,

42:23.360 --> 42:26.720
like you were nothing, then you were born, you were something and then you die, you're nothing

42:26.720 --> 42:31.120
again. There's something and nothing all the time. That wasn't even a philosophical question,

42:31.120 --> 42:37.440
this like betrugation. And then Bergson said, what really strikes me with reality and with

42:37.440 --> 42:42.720
the university is how much difference there is. God, there's so much difference and difference

42:42.720 --> 42:46.240
and difference upon difference and difference between differences and differences and differences

42:46.240 --> 42:52.320
all the time, which is relations. Relationship is obsession with difference. And I'm obsessed with it.

42:52.320 --> 42:58.400
So I start my philosophy right here and now with you guys. And then I said, what philosophy is

42:58.400 --> 43:05.440
concerned with, what metaphysics is concerned with is that shit happens. And then the question is,

43:05.440 --> 43:08.960
what is shit? What kinds of shit are there? And what does it mean that something happens?

43:10.320 --> 43:15.360
Okay, then there's a great word for that, which is emergence. And we can then locate

43:15.360 --> 43:19.840
emergence as we temporarily say, emergence is like the most important happening that ever happened

43:19.840 --> 43:24.560
to us. So we sit here and describe the world of the 21st century. What is the most important thing

43:24.560 --> 43:28.480
that ever happened to us? And this is where Greg got some of the ideas from and Greg and I started

43:28.480 --> 43:32.400
into changing, you know, knowledge with each other a few years ago, is that it makes sense

43:32.400 --> 43:36.400
then to create these different emerges that have happened. Well, apparently, some kind of big

43:36.400 --> 43:42.000
bounce or big bang, whatever happened. And physics came out of that. And we have chemistry and we

43:42.000 --> 43:47.040
have biology. And biology and physics is a hard problem to begin with. You don't need to mind

43:47.040 --> 43:51.360
a matter to have a hard problem. The hard problem is everywhere. Because if one thing is irreducible

43:51.360 --> 43:55.120
to something else, probably the problem is hard just because you're using the wrong language.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.800
If you use the language of biology, try to describe physics, you're going to go dead wrong.

43:58.800 --> 44:02.320
If you use the language of physics, try to describe biology, it won't work. So biology is

44:02.320 --> 44:06.480
just a different emergence vector compared to physics and different emerges vector. I even

44:06.480 --> 44:10.960
allow chemistry one as well. And then we would always say mind. And as Greg says, the mind has

44:10.960 --> 44:15.840
produced culture and culture is radically different from all the natures we had in the past. So we

44:15.920 --> 44:20.320
have a cultural emergence vector. So when we look at the world, we have these different

44:20.320 --> 44:27.120
emergence vectors. And then we could start make sense of each one of them independently by refusing

44:27.120 --> 44:32.880
to reduce any one of them to the other ones. Can you see how flat this becomes? So it's an

44:32.880 --> 44:38.640
emergentism to begin with. So this emergentism. Now here's the problem though. Something could

44:38.640 --> 44:43.600
happen. You know, shit happens. Something could happen that forces us to rethink how we look at

44:43.600 --> 44:49.120
the world. It's happened in the past quite a few times. It seems even like every time a new paradigm

44:49.120 --> 44:53.040
comes right now, the internet came and took over the world. And we had satellites everywhere,

44:53.040 --> 44:56.240
we're all interconnected with each other and AI comes along. And of course we start seeing

44:56.240 --> 45:00.880
networks everywhere. And then we live in a network dynamical world all of a sudden. And then of

45:00.880 --> 45:05.760
course we say, well, everything is religious. Yeah, because to us now here, network dynamical

45:05.760 --> 45:09.200
universe to make sense of this, for me sitting here is waiting talking to you guys like we're

45:09.200 --> 45:15.040
in the same room. Magic. Yesterday's magic is tomorrow's technology. Magic. Okay. So the world

45:15.040 --> 45:20.160
changes. And our world, you have to change with it. And we're only human. That means the emergentism

45:20.160 --> 45:28.480
has to be transcendental. And here's the trick. It is so, so easy by human mind, which is stuck

45:28.480 --> 45:33.360
with reductionism to try to find rules and patterns for emergencies. Say that, well,

45:33.360 --> 45:38.320
an emergency is objectively when this thing's happened that it's an emergency. And then Hegel

45:38.320 --> 45:45.520
and I just said, no way, no way, baby, you can't do that. Because if an emergency occurs, it wasn't

45:45.520 --> 45:53.520
pre-programmed. There was no creator God that dictated beforehand what constitutes an emergency.

45:53.520 --> 46:00.080
It's like Hegel says, it's only in his side that we human beings construct the necessity of the past

46:00.080 --> 46:07.360
and say that because now with what we know now, that was an emergency, but that was not. Okay.

46:07.360 --> 46:13.920
That means the number one rule for transcendental emergentism is that it disqualifies any general

46:13.920 --> 46:20.640
emergency theory. There's no general concept to what an emergency is beforehand. What happens is

46:20.640 --> 46:26.880
that when a certain emergence happens, the entire theory has to be thrown out and reconstructed as

46:26.880 --> 46:32.480
a new transcendental emergent system. And that is the transcendentality. It's allowing us to

46:32.480 --> 46:36.800
completely change everything. Or like I say, when people say they don't believe in God, well,

46:36.800 --> 46:43.680
haven't waited long enough yet, meaning God could come. Looking at AIs, getting scared like God,

46:43.680 --> 46:48.800
and we might need God because we haven't mentored the devil. We did August 6, 1945, we blow up a

46:48.800 --> 46:53.600
bomb over Oshima, the devil very much exists, and we went to the devil. So we have to do theology

46:53.600 --> 46:58.560
again and understand we didn't ment the devil. Where is God to save us from the devil? Right?

46:58.560 --> 47:02.880
Now, if you do that, if you start to think about the word like that, there's incredible freedom

47:02.880 --> 47:08.960
in going for a transcendental emergency perspective. And why I use the word emergency rather than nature

47:08.960 --> 47:14.160
is because it's a purely metaphysical theory. Greg and John are doing science metaphysics

47:14.160 --> 47:18.240
for science. I respect that. But if you do a purely metaphysical theory, it's better to work

47:18.320 --> 47:23.440
with the emergency because it's absolutely neutral. It just says that shit happens.

47:24.080 --> 47:29.600
It says nothing else. It doesn't say nature. It doesn't say culture. And it says that if an

47:29.600 --> 47:34.640
emergency happens, and we in hindsight, we live in the 21st century will agree on that these things

47:34.640 --> 47:38.560
are the most important things that ever happen in history. And then we can start looking at these

47:38.560 --> 47:41.600
are the most important things that ever happen in human history, because in the same last

47:41.600 --> 47:45.520
historical season, these dramatic events to change history forever, and we know how to live

47:45.520 --> 47:50.800
with the consequence of that. Hiroshima being one of them. Okay, that's an emergency. Transcendent

47:50.800 --> 47:54.560
emergentism applied on human history, and then we can start understanding society.

47:54.560 --> 47:58.640
So that's essentially how you do metaphysics. If you're a little philosopher like me, I guess.

48:00.560 --> 48:07.680
All right. Thank you. Each of you. I think we've gotten a very good summary of the various

48:07.680 --> 48:14.960
perspectives. I'll just put a let me let me put a little Utah spin. Then I'll invite John

48:15.520 --> 48:20.640
Benita and Bart to just talk amongst themselves. Certainly if I have there are a lot I want to

48:20.640 --> 48:26.720
say, but I really want the three of you guys to have some dialogue. I want to remind folks,

48:26.720 --> 48:34.080
since we're here in Utah land for the conference, that Utah is situated in a particular kind of

48:34.080 --> 48:39.520
problem. And that is what I mentioned earlier in terms of like Bart is coming from a different place.

48:40.320 --> 48:46.000
It is very important to understand the situation of Utah. And that's crucial to understand both

48:46.000 --> 48:52.880
its power and its limitations. It is structured to solve or it emerges out of a very particular

48:52.880 --> 48:58.640
kind of justificatory problem, which presupposes the natural sciences and the kind of knowledge

48:58.640 --> 49:03.440
they're trying to generate. And how does it then relate to psychology as both the science and the

49:03.440 --> 49:10.800
subject? And the Utah architecture is concerned with that and it emerges as a naturalism as a

49:10.800 --> 49:16.720
function of that. That does not necessarily say that, oh, that is where everyone should be situated

49:16.720 --> 49:21.200
or a philosopher that takes a pure proper metaphysical stance should be situated there.

49:21.840 --> 49:26.320
So I'll just say that in relationship to the Utah stance. So I can hang with Bart and basically be

49:26.320 --> 49:30.560
like, oh, there's a different framing that we should be aware of. And if we have those framings,

49:30.560 --> 49:34.400
I think there's a lot of participatory dance that can be effectively take place.

49:35.200 --> 49:40.960
So I'll offer that. And it's a very similar comment in relationship to Benita. And really,

49:40.960 --> 49:45.760
actually, then there's the synergy with John's view in particular. And I think that is a function

49:45.760 --> 49:50.800
of being psychologists, cognitive science, et cetera. So I'll offer that sort of as a synergistic,

49:50.800 --> 49:57.120
but I also want to get into some disagreements. I have some questions for both Bonnie and Bart,

49:57.120 --> 50:02.400
but I'm going to pause. I'm going to hand it back to John and see where you want to take it,

50:02.400 --> 50:06.400
John. And then we can just go in some dialogue amongst the four of us and then start really

50:06.400 --> 50:14.960
bringing in some questions. Yeah, John, go ahead. I think, yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you.

50:17.360 --> 50:22.320
First of all, that was really rich and wonderful. I really welcome Alexander's. Everybody seems to

50:22.320 --> 50:30.080
be calling him Bard. Is that what you want? It's okay. Sometimes sub-Bard, but then it will.

50:30.080 --> 50:36.000
It makes me feel in high school. Teenage boys often use last names as opposed to first names,

50:36.000 --> 50:42.320
so at least in Canada. I don't know why we do that. First of all, I'm very happy to get into

50:42.320 --> 50:47.680
a discussion with Hegel. I've been doing, as you probably know, Bart, there's a renaissance about

50:47.680 --> 50:55.600
Hegel going on, and the work of Brandum, the work of Pinkard, the work of Farnath,

50:56.640 --> 50:59.920
Zambroga, all these people. I'm going through all of that literature. I'm going through it very

50:59.920 --> 51:06.960
carefully with Dan Ciappi, especially Hegel's binding of the notion of rationality into

51:06.960 --> 51:13.280
reciprocal recognition between individuals, not only synchronically, but intergenerationally.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.120
I think that maps, by the way, very powerfully into current work on extended cognition,

51:19.120 --> 51:25.920
collective intelligence, things like that. You always need to ask, where's the agent that's

51:25.920 --> 51:31.360
doing the cognition? I think Hegel gives us an alternative agency. He famously talks about

51:31.360 --> 51:37.200
the I that is we that is I, and that's the kind of agency that is doing this more fundamental

51:37.200 --> 51:43.120
ontology. I think in that sense, I'm in fundamental agreement with you, and then trying to work out

51:43.200 --> 51:50.720
how does that agency operate? I won't get into the details about that. I think that is a very

51:50.720 --> 51:57.040
significant problem. It's a problem that is now becoming central to Foricog Psi. Hegel is coming

51:57.040 --> 52:03.280
in in a very big way. I think in that sense, we're in agreement. I'll speak about Whitehead

52:03.280 --> 52:11.440
in a second, and then I'll return to Benita. I do have an issue with Hegel, and I think this

52:11.440 --> 52:17.440
comes out very clearly in Pinkard. Hegel talks a lot about the sociocultural, cultural, historical

52:17.440 --> 52:24.400
processes that make the kind of persons, the kind of agents. We need all of these practices,

52:24.400 --> 52:30.640
as he repeatedly says, that makes us into the kind of cognitive agents that can recognize

52:31.760 --> 52:37.440
the inconsistencies within a particular way of life, a particular form of life. And of course,

52:37.440 --> 52:44.560
the phenomenology tries to trace both that out. The problem I have is I fear that at times Hegel

52:44.560 --> 52:50.800
verges on a performative contradiction. He is using the propositional to try to point to the

52:50.800 --> 52:57.120
non-propositional. He doesn't really give us a theory of practices or an ecology of practice,

52:58.160 --> 53:02.720
and that can't be just propositional. You, of course, have to use language, but you have to

53:02.720 --> 53:07.200
actually engage people non-propositionally. That is the way in which they learn practices.

53:07.200 --> 53:12.960
And I would put to Benita, I think she's right. We don't ultimately get at reality through

53:12.960 --> 53:19.600
truth statements. We get at reality through processes, practices of realization. And that's

53:19.600 --> 53:27.040
where I would bring in what Benita is talking about. I totally agree. We need ecologies of

53:27.040 --> 53:35.040
practices because realization is how we get conformed to reality as distinct from truth.

53:36.480 --> 53:43.520
And then the issue then comes up. Okay, well, what does that look like? And I think this takes us

53:43.520 --> 53:47.920
into some work that's going on now about some of the work I'm doing about the deep at the heart of

53:47.920 --> 53:53.760
the rational. And I think this is already presaged in Hegel. You find ritual. You find rituals of

53:53.760 --> 53:59.680
recognition and forgiveness. And you find the generation of the spirit of trust. Barnett does

53:59.680 --> 54:05.040
that very well. And you have additional arguments for why at the heart of the rational, we find

54:05.040 --> 54:11.440
ritual, we have to use all these imaginal things. Look, simple one example of many. To be rational,

54:11.440 --> 54:16.640
I have to reflect on my own cognition. Oh, well, where do I do? Well, I go into this interior space.

54:16.640 --> 54:22.160
Was that a literal space? No. Is it a merely fictional space? No, it gives you access to your

54:22.160 --> 54:27.680
cognition so you can correct it. It's but it's neither fictional nor literal. Well, what is it?

54:27.680 --> 54:32.640
It's imaginal. And you and you're engaging in ritual because you're seriously playing within

54:32.640 --> 54:38.000
an imaginal rain, rain realm, I should say, in order to bring about the fundamental kinds of

54:38.000 --> 54:44.480
transformation in metacognition that is constitutive of rationality. So at the heart of the rational

54:44.480 --> 54:50.400
is the rich is ritual. But that doesn't mean that ritual is irrational. Ritual has a non

54:50.400 --> 54:56.880
propositional rationality. It's not the rationality of coherence. It's the rationality of does your

54:56.880 --> 55:01.680
is what you're doing in your ritual context. Does it transfer systematically? Does it transfer

55:01.680 --> 55:08.160
broadly and deeply to many domains of your life? And does it transform you profoundly? Does it reach

55:08.160 --> 55:14.160
into many levels of the psyche and transform those that when when you get systematic transfer and

55:14.160 --> 55:19.120
systemic transformation, that's why rituals survive. That is how they survive. That's their

55:19.200 --> 55:24.000
rationality. That is what we that's that's how we judge a good ritual from a bad rich will.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.960
So you find the ritual and the rational rational mutually profoundly interpenetrating

55:28.960 --> 55:33.520
each other. And for me, that's the where the work of the Kyoto school, especially Nishita,

55:33.520 --> 55:40.400
is so important because Nishita develops, you know, he follows the Zen ritual into the experience,

55:40.400 --> 55:46.240
the experience, not to put that in serious quotations of nothingness. And then he does explicitly,

55:46.240 --> 55:51.840
by the way, a neoplatonic investigation into the grounds of intelligibility. And he gets to the

55:51.840 --> 55:59.280
basho. And he shows that the basho and the the Zen experience of nothingness are completely

55:59.280 --> 56:03.840
interdependent and inter reliant. And you get basically Zen, no Platonism.

56:04.960 --> 56:10.640
About Whitehead, I think I was just at the McGillchrist conference at the California Institute

56:11.360 --> 56:16.560
for Integral Studies. And of course, you know, and Ian and I agree on, you know, the right hemisphere

56:18.000 --> 56:22.640
is about the Gestalt and the left hemisphere is about the features. And I can give you all the

56:22.640 --> 56:25.760
features of the bird that doesn't give you a bird. You need the Gestalt. That's where the

56:25.760 --> 56:30.400
intelligibility actually hangs. And that's pure relationality. The right, that's what the right

56:30.400 --> 56:36.080
hemisphere is about. I'll just plug in real fast, John. Matt Siegel wanted to be here. He's actually

56:36.080 --> 56:39.520
at a conference. He sends love. And of course, we've talked to him and talked with him, Bonnie.

56:40.080 --> 56:43.840
And he's an excellent process philosopher. I'll just make that nod as you mentioned.

56:43.840 --> 56:50.640
Yeah. And I just want to finish very quickly. I don't want to monopolize. And then the thing

56:50.640 --> 56:56.960
there, of course, is the left hemisphere works with parts within a formal system and well-defined

56:56.960 --> 57:02.400
problems. Just getting a paper published now showing that you can't computationalize

57:03.360 --> 57:11.120
relevance realization because the process of formalization, the process of translating things

57:11.120 --> 57:18.160
into a formal system is not itself a well-defined problem. And it can't therefore be grasped by

57:18.160 --> 57:25.360
a formal system. Formalization is not a computational function. It is no way of running a formal system.

57:25.360 --> 57:31.280
And so you get that the right hemisphere has priority. And the right hemisphere is about

57:31.360 --> 57:37.360
pure relationality. And Ian and I fundamentally agree on that. The reason I bring that up is

57:37.360 --> 57:42.800
in Fuller in his astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being,

57:43.920 --> 57:48.640
makes the argument. And Matt Siegel and the other people, the Whiteheadians agreed that

57:49.920 --> 57:54.800
Whitehead is basically running an argument that was developed by the later Neoplatonist

57:55.680 --> 58:00.800
about pure relationality, about emergence and emanation. What Whitehead adds that I think

58:00.800 --> 58:07.760
James, I know Fuller personally, what James misses is that process of that, I think both of you are

58:07.760 --> 58:14.560
putting your finger on, which is the radical creativity. And I think that's what Bard wanted

58:14.560 --> 58:22.240
to point out too. Whitehead, the many become one and then one is added. That drawing together

58:22.320 --> 58:29.520
of all the widths isn't just a stagnant interrelationality. It's pregnant. It creates

58:29.520 --> 58:35.840
a newness, a novelty. And what I want to add to that is that that means we have to introduce

58:35.840 --> 58:43.680
into our ontology radical uncertainty. If you have radical emergence in which you can't predict

58:43.680 --> 58:51.440
the emergence, but there is some novelty introduced, you are facing radical uncertainty,

58:51.440 --> 58:58.400
which means by definition, no formal system can ultimately track reality because formal

58:58.400 --> 59:05.120
systems require the exclusion of uncertainty. So if there really is radical creativity,

59:05.120 --> 59:09.360
which is what I think Whitehead adds to the Neoplatonist, and I think what Bard is pointing

59:09.360 --> 59:16.080
to, we face an ontology in which uncertainty is not just an epistemic matter. It's not

59:16.080 --> 59:23.440
equivalent to probabilistic risk that we can calculate. It is radical uncertainty, which then

59:23.440 --> 59:30.880
means we cannot grasp it with a formal system. And I think that's the convergent with what

59:30.880 --> 59:40.480
Bard is was saying. And I think that's also part of picking up on what Benita was, I think, pointing

59:40.480 --> 59:56.560
to. And I'll end my responses there. There's 17,000 more things I want to say. But I was interested

59:56.560 --> 01:00:07.200
in also, I think sacredness is the bridging notion between the ultimacy of ontology and the

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.960
ultimacy of axiology. The sacred is that which is most valuable, but it is also bound to what is

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.400
most real. And I was trying to make an argument that if you get to this ultimate reality, you

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:25.760
have the triple transcendent, which gives you sacredness. And I think if you have sacredness

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:33.040
with unformalizability that is captured, realized, I should say, not captured, wrong word,

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:40.640
that is realized in a set of practices, I think you're very much into what religion was doing for

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:50.640
us. And that would be my response. Lovely. Okay, so how about I hand it over to Benita and see

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.280
what thoughts she wants to pick up on them? We'll really open it up, folks. You can use a question

01:00:55.280 --> 01:01:02.720
and answer chat. I see one in there already. I'll also check the chat box for this. And I know

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.720
we'll come in, but I want to give Benita and Bard an opportunity to respond to that. You guys

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.400
certainly ask each other questions as well. And I'll be checking the Q&A as well. So Benita, thoughts?

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:20.960
This is so be kind. And so as John said, there's a million things to go through. I want to say

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.800
this may be a little bit of plug, but I am on the last panel and we'll have a chance to talk about

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:34.800
my conception of God. So I'm going to leave that part out. Although it would be nice to just

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.920
put that here. And I want to talk about what I think. First of all, I have to say this because I

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:48.560
have to kind of tease Alexander Bard. Okay, so Bruno Moutour wrote this book, Speculative Grace.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:57.440
And it really sounds very much like you creating religion with a flat ontology.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:06.080
And I just think only a true genius like Bard could use Hegel as an icon for a flat ontology.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:16.640
Yeah, so that was genius. So brilliant. But I guess what I want to do is kind of

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:27.280
perform what I think Whitehead is doing. And that is everything we said about the difference

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:33.440
between the true and real. So that's the bird chair. And then he says, so then what do I have?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:43.280
What do I have to experience reality? And basically what he boils it down to is I have

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:49.360
what the Buddhists would call self validating experience of the real. And this is a feeling,

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:56.720
that the most fundamental way I can express what this experience is, is a feeling that things are

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:08.080
real. And so from this, he says, as I interpret him, as in my fantasy of being with Whitehead,

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:16.080
he then says, well, if this is, so instead of having like a metaphysical ground, this is what

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:23.360
I truly believe is the most fundamental thing I can say about myself. And then he makes his leap.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:30.960
This is the metaphysical leap. Maybe all of reality works on this template. What if all of

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.760
reality, maybe it's not just a coincidence that my experience is that this self validating feeling

01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:45.520
that something is real. And in this feeling itself validates two things. And this is where the

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:52.800
transcendent comes in. It validates that my experience is real and replete. It is whole and

01:03:52.800 --> 01:04:01.680
full. But it also validates that it's not complete. That there's a remainder in the cosmos. And this

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:11.680
creates the sense that there is more reality. So this is extremely important experience. And

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:18.160
I believe this is the kind of experience that sustained Whitehead's work. I've never read

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:24.880
a biography of him, but that it brings true to me. And I just want to combine this with something

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:34.160
that Diana Fascia says. She's a student of Panseps. And she talks about the clinical

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:43.440
experience of transformants, that the psychology, the psychologist and the client are working

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:50.960
toward this, what she calls, she says, it's an evolutionary arc that's deeply wired in humans

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:59.120
for transformants. And that truth in this sense, which is reality, is this trust or comes from

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:06.720
the word trough or trust. It's this inner understanding of clarity that is the marker for

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:15.440
awakening of perception. It emerges from awakened perception as a core truth or trust to trust

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:23.760
to truth is to behold. And so I think that these kinds of languages, these kinds of

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:39.760
confidence in the human experience is a potential point at which we can begin to

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:54.880
investigate and share and sing and celebrate the confidence of the real and share this peculiar

01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:01.680
sense that the real is always never complete. And there's always a latency in our experience. So

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:08.960
yeah, that's what I'd like to put in the space. That's awesome. I did not expect Diana Fascia to

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:16.320
pop up. I'm a fan of hers, AEDT, and that's Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Approaches.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:24.080
And it is absolutely the case that modern, emotion focused elements, gestalt frameworks,

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.600
to me, the word that I would definitely want us to hit here is primate mindedness.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:36.640
The mind, the idea that the mind is a propositional reflector that's going to represent,

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:43.840
and that's what's split off, is one of the deep errors of the Enlightenment. Mindedness is the

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:50.560
embodied contact. And clinically, what we see so much of is a disconnect, a fundamental propositional

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:56.080
disconnect. You can argue, certainly you, McGill, because John, and saying modern society in part

01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.640
is propositionally personhood disconnected from the primate embodiedness. And so much of what

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.480
we do clinically is attempt to connect to that in a relational space that creates a shared,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:15.040
non-propositional, intersubjected, I'd call it a mind-to-be space, to connect to the real.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.920
And it's so lovely to see that bridge happen in terms of me as a clinician. That's sort of an

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:26.320
unexpected turn, so I just had to prop in there. Let me hand it over to Bard, and then we'll really

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.840
start to let's, you know, engage in question and answer from the audience and whatnot.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.640
So, there's two quick responses to Bonita and Greg, because we've been in a lot of conversations,

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:42.960
and we'll be at that. This is whited at his Hegelian vest. And please remember, I use Hegel for

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.360
method. Hegel was wrong on many things. John can be short of that. He was wrong on many things,

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:52.400
but he was brilliant when it comes to method, because with Hegelian dialectics, we arrive in

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:59.360
Western philosophy with a complete set of how to think relationalism. And whited just does the

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.480
same thing. And that remainder, that's exactly the negation within the subject in Hegel. So,

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:11.120
you have those things there. So, perfect, Bonita. And as for you, Greg, this is why I am as a

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.480
psych analyst, I am fighting to get psych analysis out of the ditch of science, because as a science

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:21.520
psych analysis failed miserably in 20th century, but it took off and became a philosophical

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:28.080
discipline. And as a philosophical discipline, the 20th century was, it was anthropology became

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.600
philosophy. It was psych analysis became philosophy. And most of all, you know, to do Hegel, I had to

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:39.200
do Marshall McLuhan first, because there's no media theory in Hegel. Hegel thinks ideas develop

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:43.360
over time. No, they don't. What develops is, of course, again, relations between human beings

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:46.800
and different technologies. And because different technologies develop over time,

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.800
they change the life world we're in. And we actually take to take, we tend to take to the

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.960
technologies and proven our lives run the ones to make our miserable. And because we do that,

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:59.520
we can then expand it to learn how to read, write, count, and we can mass duplicate new kinds of

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.600
amazing things we do. And that's exactly why I think Hegel is only method and nothing else.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:07.200
Leave Hegel for the rest. That's exactly why Marx and Darwin, the other guys who came after

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.200
Hegel, all went to the material real world and threw it at Hegel with the dialectical method.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.640
But the method is great. So I, this is why I'm a great fan of Greg and where I'm involved with

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:26.080
the Utah, okay, Utah, is it called Utah? Utah. Utah is great. Utah, because I really believe

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.960
psychology needs a reformation. It needs a massive reformation. They get stuck as a service to

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.600
governments, basically to fix people to send them back to work over the past 50 to 100 years.

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:38.800
And what I loved about Greg's passion was the fact that he said, I'm a psychologist,

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.560
I'm going to take psychology seriously. I'm going to, I'm going to do what Aristotle

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:48.320
meant with psycho and logos and do real psychology. And this is exactly why I totally support the

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.440
attempt to do a proper psychology as a science, which of course then connects to John's work

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.480
as a cognitive scientist. These are great scientists, scientists, we need more of them.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.800
Okay. So for me to do psych analysis is now to do strictly an art. It's nothing but an art.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:09.680
It's a philosophical art. For me, psychoanalysis performing through people is basically taking

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.680
the entire history of philosophy down to one single human being and then put their

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.880
divigiality into philosophical perspective. It's teaching people how to do a philosophy

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.720
about themselves. That's a cycle of it. So psychoanalysis, I work today with psychiatry,

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.880
and I work today with psychologists. What I do is I arrange teams here at Stockholm

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.320
where there's psychologists, there's psychiatrists, and there's a psychoanalyst.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.400
And there are three different perspectives looking at human beings and it's stunning

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:41.200
how quickly we can get to results and solve problems and give people a quality of life

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.200
and heal, right? So, so I'm all for this. Again,

01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.880
narratology, like I told you, when you have a dialectical relation between three things,

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.880
it's usually very, very productive. Don't try to unify them into one thing.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.600
Don't try to turn logos, pathos and mythos into one thing. Keep them separate, live with the

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.800
dichotomies. This is Hegel, live the dichotomies and it's going to be productive and it's going

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.800
to be great. Okay. Now, now I want to respond to John, because I'm just going to write a word

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.080
down here in the chat channel. I'm going to put my glasses on and write it down,

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:13.920
because this is the next project I'm involved with and I'm thrilled about. It's probably my

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.880
seventh book and everything else I'm doing. Zoophism with a Z. So here's the take. When I

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.480
started traveling to Asia in the 1980s and realized the religion and philosophy had to

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.120
meet again and Eastern spirituality was amazing. And I was totally with Ken Wilber that it would

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.440
be embarrassing for my generation of philosophers to start with the Greeks once over again.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.640
No, it didn't start with the Greeks. The Greeks just wrote a lot. The Arabs saved their texts

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.480
and the Arabs saved the texts for us. And then we, inside, we made up the Greek system,

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.920
you know, the cradle civilization, whatever, and this sort of mythology about Europe.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:52.160
Josephine Quinn's new book, How the World Made the West, amazing book, better than sapiens or

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.560
whatever. It's the biggest, best history book ever written by a woman from the UK and it just

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.440
kills the idea. The Greeks started civilization. So what I did is that was that I started looking

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.880
into Asian philosophy and I started into looking into the Indian and the Chinese and Japanese and

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.680
the Persian traditions. And then I discovered that the Persian tradition is the original Greek

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:18.720
philosophy. The word philosophy is from about 600 before Christ. It was used already by

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.160
Indian Iranians 1,100 years earlier as Maas Dal Yassna in Avestan Persian, which means the

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:29.200
love of wisdom. Basically, the Greeks just bought it and he had the keys Heraclitus. So

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.280
for all these things about Neoplatonism and Zen, if you look at the Silk Road and you look at the

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.600
Silk Road Triad, as I call it, which is the traditions of Buddhism with Shiaism as well

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:44.160
in India. And then you got Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrianism in Persia. And then you got

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.160
Daoism in China. Then you got all these different spiritual schools that would never really be

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.760
fought with each other. No recorded conflicts whatsoever. Basically, just one from one way

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:56.320
to the next along the Silk Road and you found slightly different variations of the same spiritual

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.840
themes. Trade routes, great. Whatever spirituality we go into next historically is human beings.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.360
We should definitely look at the trade routes for inspiration because these religions are

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.640
non-digmatic. They're spiritual schools, they're follow practices, they're follow rituals, and

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:15.280
they basically fix our lives every day. So we get rid of the destructive bullshit and our mindset,

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.920
drop it somewhere and stay with the constructive mindset and build on that.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.480
And so when I started Zoroastrianism, the original texts, the Gathas and the Saint of Vesta,

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:28.320
translated by Germans in the 19th century, I discovered, wait, this is exactly Heraclitus.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.280
Heraclitus said the Greeks should not be Greeks. Heraclitus said we were Persians. We're part of

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:37.280
the Persian Empire. It was wrong we've been Persian, right? Heraclitus maybe even was Persian,

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.600
but the thing with Heraclitus is that by comparing Heraclitus fragments with Zoroastrian Gathas,

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.040
which I did 30 years ago, I discovered this is going to be the gold mine I'm going to work from.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:52.000
And what I'm now doing, what we're probably doing now is basically the Zed in Zufism is,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.520
of course, Zufism, be taking back Zufism from its origin. Zufism, taking it away from Islam.

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:02.080
Sorry guys, but you didn't invent this, you know, you always hated it and you always badmouthed it

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.040
because it was modest and all those things that we love. So basically Zufism is a modest

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:12.000
reinterpretation of Zufism as older than Islam. And we then discovered that this is exactly

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.240
what Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met. And Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met in contemporary

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.800
Central Asia. And of course, out of that, we got Bodhidharma, who was not a prince from India,

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.640
was a trader from Sogna. We got Babasavana, who is not an Indian Prince. He was another trader.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.400
He came from Tajikistan today and he came to Tibet. So Varayana and Zen are just to be drenched,

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.480
drenched in Persian philosophy as much as their Chinese were Indian. And these are the richest

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.800
traditions I can find in the world today. See, if I'm going to do religion and philosophy and go back

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.760
5,000 years and go to find the gold mines and do whatever we can do today to understand ourselves

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.320
and our history as humans, this is the gold mine I'm totally obsessed with. I can't do Peru and

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:57.840
Mexico too. Other guys have to do that. But I'm totally obsessed with duration and with heritage

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:02.720
and I think where John and I are both heading, maybe this is the future where we can go into

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.360
conversation future, I think we're heading is that if I pursue Zufism, I mean, when John just

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:14.240
mentioned the Kyoto school, chairs came out of my eyes right away. These are my months I've spent

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.200
in Zen temples in Korea and Japan. This is exactly what I love the most about this conversation.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.520
So I'm just dropping towards Zufism for the first time here because my team here in Scandinavia

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.280
agreed. We call each other Zufis now. You can call it Zen Zufis if you like, but we are practicing

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.480
now living a Zufism and we're obviously finding other Zufis out there around the world who also

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.560
managed to live with this sort of monist spiritual tradition with daily practices.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.600
So just want to put that out there and then say that Neoplatonism, maybe then John can dig deeper

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:48.960
to whatever. I don't get too stuck with the Neoplatonist. I love Hellenism. I think Hellenism

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:54.480
was the most fantastic thing ever. But for me, it's actually deeper. I think before Plato, we go

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:59.920
before Plato with the priests of critics, we discovered they did philosophy flux. They did

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:06.400
Relationalism. Relationalism is the oldest philosophy. It's rather later when, you know,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.840
the Greeks start thinking and mathematics comes into the picture, Pythagoras over there,

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:13.280
and there's so fatigued with mathematics, they think, well, there could be perfect forms out there.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.720
Well, that's an interesting idea, but it's not actually how the world operates.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:21.120
Today, it's the computer scientists with zeros and ones. And if they have billions of dollars,

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.680
think they're philosophers when they're really dangerous. So we have to respond to that whole

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.440
sort of computer science attempt to turn the world into zeros and ones and nothing but zeros and ones

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:37.040
and create this sort of deterministic nightmare that comes out of it and respond to that with what

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:45.280
John perfectly calls the radical uncertainty. The radical uncertainty is Hegel's. We are terrified

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.240
of our freedom because the future is completely contingent. It is the past which is a necessity

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:58.560
because the past is locked up. History in Hegel is like a zigzag. So everything the zigzag is

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.800
the past. Don't change that. Amofati, Nietzsche said, just accept that whatever happened happened.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.440
That's factual truth. But the future is completely scaringly contingent and open and we are active

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:14.080
agents engaged in the future. And for me, that's being a Sufi. So I'll leave it at that.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:18.080
Well, lovely. John, you want to respond to that? And then I'll take some questions from the audience.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.160
Yeah. Bart, you may be pleased to know that the next big series I'm working on and it's going to

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:28.960
be Titanically Bigger than my previous two. I'm going to go on like on location. It's going to be at

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:36.320
different levels of media presentation. A macro, a mezzo and a micro is called the Philosophical

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.400
Silk Road in which I actually pick up the proposal. Now, I talk about Xanthoplatonism,

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:50.080
but we can quibble about things like that. I think Neil Platonism plays a role in Sufism too.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:57.200
But I don't want to get mired in a historical argumentation here. I think the orientation

01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:04.640
is very much aligned. And true to my criticism of Hegel, I'm not going to merely talk about this.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.840
This has become a personal pilgrimage for me. I'm going through a purgation process right now

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:15.600
that I have not called for, but has called me in which I'm fundamentally preparing to actually go

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:21.360
to these places and be transformed by looking at the past, by also drenching myself in what I call

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:32.000
the geo-philosophy, the culture and the history. And so making myself a vehicle that's too pretentious,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.080
at least put myself in service of the advent of the sacred that is happening right now

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.400
in response to the meeting crisis. But it seems like what you are talking about and what

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.120
I'm talking about, though not identical or deeply convergent. So I just wanted to reply to that.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:50.880
That's the next big project, right? So that's really lovely. And actually,

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:56.160
there's a question from Victor. So I'm going to go to some Q&A. I'll see if I can pick it up

01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.040
in the chat if there are other kinds of elements. If Victor wants to unmute, he can read this or

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:08.800
I will read it for him. I think it's a fascinating question. Wait a second. I'm not sure. Why don't

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.320
I go ahead and read it, Victor, if you're around and you can unmute and then you can dialogue.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.920
And so here's the question. Our being in an emergence pervades our collective awareness,

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:27.360
gestured at as a time between worlds. How can a philosophy of transcendental emergentism

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:35.520
inform science such that the preferable emerges? Where do we want to go? What do we cultivate?

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:41.040
What's the relationship, I think, between facts and values? Is there a direction where we're

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:45.680
cultivating preferable? I hope I don't put too many words in Victor's mouth. But I'll throw that

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:51.040
out there and see if somebody wants to pick up. What are we oriented toward? What are we trying

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.280
to do in form of science? I would also wonder also about practices, et cetera.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.640
I would, first of all, say that one of the things that comes out of this, and Pickstock does a lot

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.000
of work on this and so does filler, but other people have, I've mentioned case beer, putnam,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.880
some of my own work. The fact value distinction, the is-ot distinction, is breaking down.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.600
It doesn't mean there aren't differences, but there are differences like the difference between

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:23.600
two colors, right? They're on a continuum of degree and they're not differences in kind.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:30.000
You can't actually ever state a fact that is not simultaneously a value judgment.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.400
You can't make any value judgment that is not simultaneously a statement of fact.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:40.880
They are non-logically identical, but they are inseparably interpenetratingly bound to one

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:46.880
another. And I think as long as we still frame this as we have to solve the is-ot problem,

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.840
no. I don't often invoke Wittgenstein, but here's where I think Wittgenstein is

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.800
appropriate. We don't solve the is-ot problem. We are in a place now where we dissolve it,

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:03.200
and then we get back to an ontology that allows us for profound connectedness to reality.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:12.560
And I think for me, any way forward that doesn't prioritize that connectedness

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:21.360
to the religio in a way that is rationally self-confident, sending, rationally self-correcting,

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.320
all that sort of stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about here, and that's part of

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.560
what Hegel was on about. It is rationally self-correcting. It's just not strictly

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:33.520
syllogistic logic, right? Because the process is to be self-correcting or you can't distinguish

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:42.400
foolishness from wisdom. But I think for me, what comes out of this, and I can make a deeper

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:50.240
argument, but wise love, agopic love, like what is guiding you to loving more wisely,

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.040
and what is allowing you to love wisdom in an interpenetrating manner. I think

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:03.760
if people are looking for a practical normativity to guide them in practice, that's important.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.320
And then one other thing I would say is give up the monological standpoint.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:14.800
The evidence is now overwhelming. We reason better collectively than we do individually.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:21.200
Experimental evidence is merging. And this is what I would say, not pushback on Bard. I think this is

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.520
amplification. The dialectic has to be accompanied with a diologos, which is

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:33.680
dialogical practice, because that gives you the cognitive agent that is actually capable of doing

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:40.720
this new kind of realization of a new kind of ontology, in which fact and value are no longer

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.440
separate, in which theory and data are no longer separate, in which analytic and synthetic are

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:52.720
no longer separate, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bard is right. This is hard, but it is already

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:58.080
happening. And I think we should orient to the places. Here is one of them, and there are many

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:05.360
others where it's happening. And we should do our best to culturally try to bind all these places

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.320
and practices together. That would be my recommendation. I agree totally with John here.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:17.120
It's just called Nartological Dialectics in my dingo, but it's exactly the same thing. So it's

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:22.080
a very humbling kind of standard dialectics works, and you can't arrive at a fixed point anytime.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.000
I think the really scary thing right now out there is that the people who were

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.120
diabetic have gone fundamentalist and gone hysterical, as we're seeing in the Middle East

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.760
right now. That's terrifying, especially if these guys have access to atomic bombs and can blow us

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.960
all up. That's a very, very real threat. And the reason why it goes hysterical is because

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:47.520
fundamentalism is like the end state of something that's already dead. It's like imagine an ideology

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.520
which is zombie-like. It is almost dead. So the last thing you do is that if God does not intervene

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.760
in the world as he should do according to your dogma, you have to act on God's behalf.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.440
The scary thing right now with Islam and Christianity is they might get the armageddon

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:09.440
they prophesied about, but it's all self-made. This is terrifying. This is very, very real.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:15.600
My recommendation then is to say the revolution is currently completely on the technological side,

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.560
and that's scary because the revolution is going hay-walk right now and needs to be contained.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:27.280
For me as a human, that means I react exactly the opposite way. I retract. The most radical thing to

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.680
do as a human today is to retract, like John so wisely says, like we all do here, retract, step

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:40.560
back, go into retreat, observe the world from the outside. And yeah, it's about love. It's about love.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.000
It's about finding that spot where that love is and feeling, be human. This is why we can't do

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:52.320
for loss without spirituality any longer. It's just another data. But what I'm saying is that

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:58.080
what Hegel did is that he basically said his absolute is on the meta-level precisely because

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.920
he doesn't allow any absolute on the formal level. That's exactly why Hegel is great in the sense

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.640
that he says that the only absolute I have is that there is no absolute in the sense that

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:14.240
there is only movement and flux all the time, and all we can do then we try to think those fluxes

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:20.080
are dialectical processing and dialectical thinking. And that's what we can do to not arrive at any

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.120
fixed point, only temporary solutions to temporary problems. And that's what we do all the time.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:31.120
That means it's incredibly anti-dogmatic. That's the whole point. And the anti-dogmatism is exactly

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.240
what we need more of the world today. Whenever you can, if you're going to be a missionary about

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:39.280
anything today, you're going to be a missionary about anti-dogmatic, go anti-dogmatic and dissolve

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.080
these dogmas out there because they're the ones that are really affecting us.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.880
Bonnie, did you yet want me to respond to that?

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:52.480
Yeah, I wanted to ping on what was where John and Barb were talking about philosophy is

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:59.200
dialogic. And then I saw a question pop up in the chat, could Bonnie give us examples of fierce

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:07.440
naturalism? So I can kind of answer, build on the dialogic by answering with what I would call

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.760
fierce naturalism. Okay, so on the one hand, there's on one level, I completely agree that

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:23.520
philosophy is dialogical. But I think we there's so the fierce naturalism would say yes,

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:31.040
but not dialogic at the level of words and thinking with thoughts. And this is where

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:37.280
if you think of the concept of a stack, I think that so for example,

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:46.880
if you can imagine atoms, atoms are dialogical, they're resonance with each other, there's either

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.080
constructive or deconstructive interference. And this is a kind of feeling between the

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:58.560
resonance. And then we get to sentience. And sentience is a dialogue through touch,

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.760
you know, so the worm oscillating in an ordered environment is touching the environment.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:11.520
So that's I touch, and then we have cognizance, where these are gestures, these are physical,

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.680
in emotional aphid laden gestures at the animal mind level, let's say, and that's

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:24.880
dialogic gestures are dialogic gesture is touch at a distance. And then we get into the Hellenistic

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:30.960
and the lyrical philosophies, pre Socratic philosophies, where people are saying or singing.

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:38.400
So this is a calm response, the Psalms and the lyrical Hellenistic philosophy. So you just feel

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:49.680
what this is, this I touch, I gesture, I say, I sing, then you get into the great epic of Gilgamesh

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.760
and the narratives of the Iliad and the Odyssey. And now we're right at the heels of the Socratic

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:02.960
time. And this is when we're starting to tell. So instead of like lyrical and saying with that

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:08.400
with, you know, saying in a calm response, you have someone telling the whole history of the

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:15.920
people, the whole history of, you know, Troy, and the whole history and these become so there's a

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:23.040
reduction in the dialogical nature at this point in history. And then with the Socratics,

01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:30.880
I would argue that becomes I name. So instead of telling a story of a man who was courageous,

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.960
but also an asshole to his wife, and all these kinds of very complex ways in which humans in

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:43.120
nature show up in the as in the allegories, we start to say, Well, that's too confusing, we never

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:50.800
see a real courageous man, because sometimes he's not courageous. So let's extract and isolate these

01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:58.720
virtues, these variables from reality, and name them. And this is, I think, where we're the next

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:07.120
phase is now we name, then we're going to compute. Okay. So I see this progression that the telling

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:14.880
and then the naming is a bottleneck. And so we go from sentience, cognizance, consciousness,

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:22.400
to reflexive awareness. And this is where we get to I tell, I name, I compute. So it's the

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:28.320
progressive simulation of the self. And then we start dialoguing with the self. And I think this

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:35.040
is a bottleneck. So what we're doing in we call it lyric culture is now we want to move from

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:41.920
reflexive awareness to receptive awareness. So there's an opening as john describes very well,

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:48.640
I see I see with the eye of the soul. This is kind of a Gnostic insight. And then you go from

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.200
receptive awareness to open awareness. So receptive awareness, you still have the sense that

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:01.040
you're receiving perceptions and open awareness is more like I'm feeling. And so we're back to

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:09.440
Whitehead's insight that there's a resounding resonance of feeling that I am embedded it,

01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:15.760
I'm not I'm not just receiving it. And then we I mean, this is this is all, you know,

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:23.840
a methodology. And then from there, you become you get the sense of the I am. And this is the

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:30.400
transcendent sense of the radiant being of reality or the radiance being the radiance of God,

01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:36.400
or the radiance of the divine. And you find that within yourself. And the naming the telling

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:43.280
and the naming and the computing are in the wrong direction. We have to dial that back and move to

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:50.240
our receptive awareness, open awareness, and the sense of original radiance, which you might say

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:58.560
is how the universe started. So that's kind of like a fierce naturalism take on this conversation.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.000
And I thank you for the opportunity to put it on the table. It's not completely resonant with

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:14.240
what else we've been talking about. Okay. What I'd like to do now is I've got another question.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.360
Second one that came up, this is from Spencer. I'll read it, Spencer, certainly feel free to

01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:25.600
pop in. But I'll read this is actually directed at Alexander Bard. How do you feel about the idea

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:30.880
that Hegel needs to be read together with Schelling and later ficta 1804 plus to be fully

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.680
relationally understood, for instance, to fully read Hegel with whitehead and delused?

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.480
That's where the question ends if Spencer wants to. So where does Hegel fit?

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:47.600
Yeah, okay. But that's been done. That's been done a lot. Hegel is put together with the German

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.640
idealists, and he's not an idealist. He's really a dialectician. The way I do Hegel is I do Hegel's

01:31:54.640 --> 01:32:00.240
method. And then I provocatively call myself a pan dialecticist. I think fundamentally,

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.600
everything in the universe, the only thing I can say about all the different mergers vectors,

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.680
if they all seem to have some kind of dialectical quality to them. So I just call myself a pan

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:13.680
dialecticist. Then I learned the lesson from Hegel. No, what wasn't done is the weird artificial

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:17.440
opposition between Hegel and Nietzsche. When I started reading the guys my teenage years,

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:22.880
he was like, they're compatible. They're perfectly compatible. I mean, Nietzsche's armor fought

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.400
which is his, you know, axiology. It's just where his values start from. It's exactly like Hegel's

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:32.400
the necessity of the past and scared of the contingency of the future and the freedom. It's

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:37.440
exactly affirmation in Nietzsche. They're perfectly compatible. And I'm glad the whole new generation

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.960
today, at least in Europe, they're all reading Hegel and Nietzsche through each other, which is

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.920
incredibly productive to get all the best uses bits out of these amazing 90s century thinkers.

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:52.000
Then when you start looking at the 20th century, I found Whited, who I loved to bits,

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:59.200
and he also does relationalism. And it's almost like Whited. Deleuze, of course, later in France,

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:02.720
in the late 20th century, Deleuze does the same thing with Guattari in France,

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.360
and they're amazing thinkers. I love Deleuze and Foucault. These are the guys I grew up with.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:13.680
But Deleuze's attempt at trying to do Hegel as if Hegel did not exist is exactly what Whited

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:19.840
actually did. Whited did Hegel as if Hegel did not exist, and then applied on the natural sciences

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.120
and mathematics and tons of stuff that Hegel was not aware of, which is why I think Whited is fantastic.

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.720
So I prefer to use the Hegelian method and read it through the 20th century thinkers and then try

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:35.600
to read it through us and try to read it through 20th century philosophy, what the Hegelian method

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:41.840
can mean today. But as method, it is amazing. And I'm so glad that John, who's so fantastic,

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.000
is now going to put his head on to Hegel because the day for Varkey goes on Hegel.

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:54.240
That's got to be enormous. Okay. I've got a question here from Kevin Katwas.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:34:03.440
And this question is, how does an ontology of pure relationality relate to the emerging digital

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:09.840
network decentralized institutions of the future? How does an ontology of pure relationality relate

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.400
to an emerging digital network and decentralized institutions of the future?

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:22.480
I guess that's kind of my question again anyway. It's the paradigm we're in right now is the network

01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.600
dynamical paradigm. Some call it digital, some call it the internet, some call it AI, whatever.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.640
What happened is the technology now is going global. We get satellites everywhere. Everything is

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.280
interconnected. The threat there is to arrive in a surveillance police state. We don't want that. So

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.760
I'm totally with decentralization and try to think how can we still have a network dynamical

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.320
society with all its benefits but still lived in a decentralized way? That's a fairly difficult

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.720
question to solve. Is it typical axiological question today? So we are networked up because we

01:34:52.720 --> 01:35:00.240
I've got a question here from Cody Palmer. Does a neoplatonic framework create an ontological

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:09.440
structure? Greg, can you hear us? I think you couldn't hear you, Alexander. I think that's a

01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:19.840
problem. All right. Greg, are you still there? He looks frozen. Yeah, that's Alexander just

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:24.080
hanging on a sec. I think that's what happened there. I don't think he was being rude. I think

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:27.200
he thought you'd stopped. Yeah.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.840
I could just finish the answer as soon as he can get where to back because the rest of you are all

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:43.120
here, right? It was just Greg's problem, right? Yeah. He'll be back. So I'm just going to finish

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.160
the question. The thing is that I'm with Marsha McLuhan, an amazing philosopher, by the way,

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:53.280
in that media we use. I'm going to show you this because the last time you said him,

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.880
did you have you read his Remedian book? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I mean,

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.720
if anybody's going to save the pope, it's going to be Marsha McLuhan, the best Catholic in the

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:10.800
world, right? But the thing is that the media we use will also affect how we think. And that's why

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.280
this sort of minoritarian thinking that Hegel and White did practice at the time is not

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.600
becoming majoritarian. We're all starting to think like they think because living in a world

01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:24.400
drenched in network relations and we try to figure out how relations must work. And it's fantastic

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.840
to live in a relations universe. So why not? But that's why that's why relations become a big

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.160
topic because it actually reflects the technological environments we are in right now.

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:40.640
I'd like to answer to that too, then, while we wait for Greg to come back.

01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.440
And I think this is actually convergent with what Bart is saying. What you still have,

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.920
and this goes to what we're now in what's called the fourth rationality debate. We've had a whole

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:57.360
bunch. What is rationality? You still have people claiming that this can ultimately be grasped in

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:05.440
an a priori axiomatic system, all of this. And that that is kind of the epistemological version

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:12.320
of the zombie fundamentalism that Bart was pointing to, but within a scientific, scientific

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:19.520
framework. And part of what we try to argue in two papers, one is

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:23.760
relevance, rationality and relevance realization. The other one is naturalizing

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.320
relevance realization. Is that project is actually doomed? You can't do it that way.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:34.640
It's not that there aren't top down aspects, but you can't step out. This is Hegel. You can't

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.320
step out and give an a priori top down, right? Optimization that will work algorithmically

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.400
across all possible contexts. This is the last ditch attempt that is being made in order to

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:53.280
wrestle with the network reality and the dynamic system reality we're realizing here. And I think

01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:02.000
that is a kind of scientific fundamentalism that is strongly analogous to a lot of religious

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:10.240
fundamentalisms that we have. But because they typically don't blow up buildings or what not

01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:15.680
they don't get the deserved attention. But if you don't think these people are going to cause

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:22.000
terrific suffering, if they succeed, I think you're being foolish. So I would want to point out that

01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:30.880
there is an attempt to recapture all of what Bart was pointing to, right, about network dynamics

01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:39.680
in a top down, a priori axionomic formal systemization. And I think this is the last ditch

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:47.440
attempt. And so I think that has to be properly challenged and resisted. I've been trying to do

01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:55.520
so, by the way. And I think other people are. I totally agree with John. That's why I said

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:00.320
Surveillance Police State. Yes. And this book Processing Event is a manifesto against that

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:04.080
happening. The scientist fundamentalists are going to go for the surveillance police state and they're

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.360
going to do good in the world. It's like vulgar Platonism. They're going to go for the good in

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.840
the world by controlling absolutely everything. Well, that's already happening, because T and

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.480
Ping is trying to do it in China with vulgar Confucianism, because vulgar Confucianism is

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:22.000
exactly vulgar Platonism. And these are the two heritages we got in Eastern and Western thinking

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.640
we need to get rid of once and for all. We call them the pillar saint ideologies. The pillar

01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:32.080
saint ideologies that Confucianism and Platonism at his worst is the little 11 year old boy who

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.560
threw his wonderful little idea that if everybody did everything the way I think they should do

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.680
the world will be wonderful and everything be a sunny day forever. And they're there. I mean,

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.920
most computer scientists I meet when they start to think about philosophy, their mind gets stuck

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:50.960
there. I think it's great that you mentioned that here, John. Scientific fundamentalism is

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.600
exactly, scientific fundamentalism is the right term for that. And it's just as scary as any

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.360
of the other fundamentalists, especially these guys have so much power and influence today.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.760
We've got to avoid the surveillance police state precisely because we need an open society

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:09.920
without an open society, all freedom is gone. All right. Hey, folks, I'm back.

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:16.800
It looks like we have Scott. It's got a question. I'm noting the time here. Why don't we ask Scott

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:23.360
a question, respond to that, and then we'll congeal, give some final thoughts, and then we'll end

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:29.200
the session that way. Scott. Thank you very much. I appreciate having the opportunity to open my mic.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.880
I tried to type the question and it blew up. Alexander, I very much appreciate your rich,

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:43.040
bold understanding of Hegel. And if we're going to talk about Hegel and Whitehead

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:48.720
and be serious about process ontology, then stability becomes a scale relative phenomenon.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:56.320
In other words, the things, one of the things I've confirmed your speaking language.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:03.920
Hold on. Okay. Hold on. There you go. Okay. Sorry. I got a zoom thing I had to answer.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:10.640
A question I have. This is in my work. I look at where you, the things you described,

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.480
where we weren't wrong with thingism. Why would it's difficult to think relationally?

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.880
One of the artifacts of the way dynamical systems work is that dynamic stable states emerge

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:27.760
relatively in a dynamic space. So they're transient. Yet we've confused the stability with

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:35.040
the fixedness. Our thoughts come to be as temporally stable states that come and go in a

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:41.600
hyper complex nervous dynamic. Our words are the same. So I think I just want to get your reaction

01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.400
to the idea that we've confused the stable states that our brains necessarily create to have things

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:53.200
we call thoughts. We've confused those abilities with the way the world is, not seeing the actual

01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:58.960
multi-scale dynamic work that makes the emergence of temporarily stable states possible. I know

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:05.440
there was a lot, but I had to ask that of you given your talk. Totally agree. That's why the book is

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:12.800
called process and event. In a very, very, very fundamental rudimentary addressing all the

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:16.960
problem of the East and the West, where East and West can learn is that the East got stuck with

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:21.520
process and I've never met Chinese or an Indian intellectual who didn't agree with me. They got

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.760
stuck with the process. The problem was that in Western culture, especially through Islamic

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:30.000
Christianity, we got so obsessed with the event and we forgot about the process. What then happened

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.360
is that the event itself becomes endlessly repeated. Christ on the cross all the time,

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.120
Mohammed storming Mecca all the time, every year again and again, say we're from the back.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.360
The problem is that reality is process and event, meaning human is process and event,

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:51.280
East and West, man and woman, dynamic relations all the way down. I'm just basically advocating,

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:56.400
if you can think that the event is the stability and it's temporary, remember it's temporary,

01:42:56.400 --> 01:43:01.120
so you can use it and build from, but then things will move on and the new process will start.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:07.360
Then what happens is you realize that processes are repeated, but the process is never identical

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:14.640
to the previous lap of the process. That tiny little difference enables you to create an event

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:19.680
and change history forever in a new constructive direction. I think that's a wonderful thought

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:24.880
that any engineer I've ever met is thrilled about hearing because they try to find that little spot

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.200
where they can improve on the world every day when they work. So process and event,

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.160
that's what the books call that. That's the unity of the two.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:42.720
All righty, that's lovely. Let me offer a few thoughts first off. First off, thank you all

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.720
for really stimulating our 45 minutes. My heart is filled with joy to stay at the primate level

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:54.800
and the exchange of ideas, the feeling in the room was really good. One thing,

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:59.680
a couple things I want to mention. One is let's make sure we're clear about where we're locating

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:06.480
how we're entering into this. Certainly, Utah's location is explicit. I appreciated our exchange

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.680
being clear where John's coming from. I think where Bernice is coming from. Understanding

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.240
where we're entering and then to see the convergence through those various elements,

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:24.480
to me, is really inspiring and fascinating. Another area of convergence I want to mention

01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:31.440
with Bard is that narratology with its logos, pathos, and mythos has lots of parallels with

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:36.320
Utah's epistemological pillars of the Tree of Knowledge, the Iquocoin, and the Garden. That's

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:42.480
really a logos, pathos, mythos, frame of reference. I also want to speak to some of what obviously I

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.600
share with John and our hope for transcendent naturalism, at least in relationship to a

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:53.520
strong transcendence of a collective emergence, a collective intelligence that transforms the

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.480
onto epistemological relation. I think that's desperately needed. The last thing I'll say

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.960
in relationship to Bonnie is the embodiment of being. Contact with the cutting through

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.240
metaphysics down into the experience of being, to me, is absolutely central and we've lost that

01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:16.880
in many ways. To regain that is aspects of the core of the task as I see us moving forward.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.800
All of these things, to me, are connecting in particular ways. They're inspiring. They're

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:29.120
spurring lots of thoughts. I'll go to John and then Bonnie and Bard can have the last word and

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.760
then we can wrap up. John, any final thoughts you want to share as we bring this to a close?

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:44.800
I found this tremendously fecund. I'm always impressed when there's considerable convergence

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:51.200
and its convergence. There's enough difference. We're not just echo-chambering. Convergence

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:58.320
requires that there's real difference, although they come to shared conclusions,

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.120
maybe resolutions is a better word, because that raises the plausibility of the overall framework

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.800
dramatically. If Bonita working, I'm not claiming we're completely independent of each other,

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.640
that's ridiculous, but she's working independently. Bard is working independently.

01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.400
There's significant enough differences between what we're saying that we're not just echoing

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:27.680
each other. As we unwrap, unfold our particular argumentative paths, we come to very similar

01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:34.400
kinds of realizations. I think that raises the overall plausibility. I would say that if you

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:41.200
listen to the geist between the three of us, you actually get the best possible argument

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:44.560
for what is needed right now.

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.320
Lovely. Bonnie?

01:46:51.040 --> 01:47:08.800
Yeah, I just want to end by pointing out a kind of confusion. My work, as you kind of situated

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:21.600
my work, always emphasizes the animal level. But what I hope you can understand from my work

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:27.200
is that I'm not just, you see, the problem is when you work from the kind of stratified

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:34.320
reality that you have, you're saying my work is down there in the animal realm. This is the problem

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:41.360
with the stocks, because my work is saying, okay, this reflexive awareness, we're telling,

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.360
we're naming, we're going to compute. Just because this is more on the scene recently,

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:54.240
it could be a mistake. There could be an alternative. It could be the wrong way.

01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:01.040
I'm saying that these other moves come out of our animal nature, but they're beyond the human

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:17.280
condition so far. This is why it's tricky to have always work from that stock, because I'm not a

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:27.600
pagan. You're going like this, you know, I know you know. I just want to end with that. I too found

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:35.680
the conversation lovely and very complex and probably challenging for many people who

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:41.760
stayed stuck with us, because there's so many different worlds popping up. And so yeah,

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:47.840
and thank you all so much for being a part of this. Lovely. I'll just say amen.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:55.120
Barb? Yeah, I just want to say that this was like the most wonderful check-in with you guys.

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:59.360
I'm sitting here on the other side of the Atlantic and you're some of my best friends in

01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.640
North America and it's just wonderful to collaborate with you. And I will dig into your work even more

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:10.960
than ever, all three of you. And certainly I'm very inspired. I'm working on a term myself at the

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:14.640
moment, which was not part of this conversation, but just to point out how inspiring this is.

01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:18.080
And it's called emotional intelligence. And this is the ridiculous thing.

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.640
Intelligence is currently the most important word in our language and it's not being defined by

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.600
anybody. That in itself is terrible. That's a really dangerous position that we're actually

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:31.920
using the word intelligence as if we knew we're talking about it. There are so many Italian

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:37.600
gents to begin with. And AI is just one of them and a minor one, to be honest about it. So I'm

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:41.360
working with the concept of emotional intelligence, which I think it ties in very nicely with White

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:46.400
Ted and very nicely with Bonita's work, just the example of how inspiring this conversation is.

01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:50.800
But that's another conversation altogether. All right, well, maybe we'll have future

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:57.520
conversations then. All right, folks, thank you so much, each of you, for bringing your wisdom.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:02.800
It's been a real joy. It's lovely to host this in the context of the Utah Consilience Conference

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.320
and to think about the kinds of philosophies, metaphysic, empirical experiences of being

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:14.320
oriented toward wisdom in the 21st century. And I love the dance and I appreciate the connection.

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.960
Thanks to everybody. Thanks for all the questions. Super engaging. So what we're doing now is

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:22.240
basically you got an hour. I think there's plenty to digest here and go for a walk,

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.960
get a cup of coffee. We'll be back at one o'clock where you have three options

01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.080
for three wonderful symposia. And then again, at three o'clock, three options. I'm really

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:36.400
looking forward to the afternoon. I feel like conference off to a great start and go get some

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:43.280
nourishment, share some love, hang out, meditate, etc. We'll see everybody soon. Okay, take care.
