21760	25040	Thank you, Catherine. That was probably the best introduction I've ever received.
25600	30960	I assure you, I'm very happy to be here and I'm very engaged with the material I'll be
30960	39920	presenting to you. Okay, so let's start. Why is, why beauty is deeply implicit in stoicism,
39920	46960	especially in its commitment to rationality and virtue? So, Han, in his book, Saving Beauty,
46960	52160	laments that we have reduced the beautiful to the smooth. This is what he calls it.
52800	60560	This is the pleasantly, easily accessible and useful. So, the way my phone is smooth. The way
60560	68800	many things are now smooth. And this is convergent with his work in another book, Agony, the Agony
68800	75360	of Eros, about how intimacy with mystery, which used to be in our erotic relationship,
75840	82880	and this intimacy with mystery, which demands transformation and commitment from us,
83600	91680	has been replaced by pornography that gives priority to easy access and use for pleasure.
92800	97280	So, this is the idea of the reduction of the beautiful as something that was initially
98160	107360	very transformative and very demanding upon us to something that in fact puts very little demand
107360	115760	on us whatsoever. Now, he's no doubt correct how this reflects a consumerist greed in our culture
115760	122000	and a culture oriented to quick and easy gratification, to bottom line mentality, etc.
122800	126480	And his argument, of course, is convergent with the argument of other people, just one among
126480	134880	many examples, arguments from current musicologists about the loss of complex melody in popular music
134880	141840	in favor of super salient, please remember that notion, super salient beat and repetition. So,
141840	148400	again, we have easy access and of course, easy access makes sense when we are doing mass marketing
148400	155520	within a mass society. I think all of this is completely coherent argument. However, I believe
155520	161040	that there is something more going on in this reduction of beauty to ease of access to pleasure
161040	167760	and use. I think something else is going on. I propose that there is a deep suspicion about
167760	175120	appearance in our culture. There is a suspicion that appearances are misleading, distorting,
175760	183840	distracting, untrustworthy, and often being used for manipulation nefarious manipulation.
183840	191680	In my work with Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic in 2019 in a book entitled Zombies
191680	197600	in Western Culture, A 21st Century Crisis, in which we explained the emergence of the zombie
197600	204640	mythology as a way of articulating the meaning crisis, we noted the upsurge in the increasing
204640	209200	prevalence and power of bullshit. People are convinced there's more and more bullshit,
209200	214960	and it is more and more powerful in our society. Now, the notion of bullshit I'm using, I'm not
214960	222800	trying to be vulgar. I'm making explicit use of Frankfurt's technical arguments about bullshit in
222800	230480	his seminal essay on bullshit. So, Frankfurt distinguishes the liar from the bullshit artist.
230480	236400	The liar tries to manipulate your behavior by depending on your concern for the truth
236400	241920	and getting you to believe something to be true that is not true. That is the liar. The liar is
241920	248560	depending on your caring commitment to the truth. The bullshit artist, on the other hand, is trying
248560	255840	to get you indifferent to whether or not some claim is true and rather to be caught up in the salience
255840	260880	of the claim. So, prototypical examples of this, of course, are an advertising in which,
261600	266480	you know, you see the commercial and there's a beautiful person
267840	273600	in a bar and they're surrounded by other beautiful people. And notice my invocation of that. We'll
273600	279440	come back to that. And there's an alcohol present and they're all very happy and very healthy.
280000	284160	And you know this isn't true. You know that this is not what you're going to see if you go into a
284160	288240	bar. This isn't what you know this is not going to happen to you when you start drinking the alcohol.
288240	294960	And they know that you know that none of this is true. And this is the important point. It doesn't
294960	300720	matter because it puts you into a state where you don't care whether or not it's true and you just
300720	307840	find the stimulus of the alcohol super salient. And therefore, you are much more likely to buy
307840	313520	the alcohol, which of course is why so much money is poured into advertising. So, advertising is
313520	320000	prototypical bullshit. It works by getting you to not care about the truth at least some of the time
320640	326000	and who instead be caught up in the salience of what is being presented to you. Now, what's
326000	330800	interesting about this is the deep connection between bullshitting and self deception and how
330800	336640	they mutually reinforce each other. You see, although we use the metaphor, you cannot really
336640	342320	lie to yourself. You cannot say to yourself, I believe X, but I want to believe Y because
342320	347840	belief is not a direct voluntary action. Belief is not something you do. Pick a belief you'd like
347840	354240	to have that everybody loves you. Okay, do it. Believe it. Go. There's nothing to be done. You
354240	358000	can imagine it. You can hope for it. You can desire it. You can't believe it. That's not how
358000	363680	belief works, but you can bullshit yourself because salience is actually affected by your
363680	368800	attention. If I say your left big toe, it is now a salient to you. And of course, when things are
368800	375680	salient, now they will tend to attract your attention in the future. And so by paying attention to
375680	380080	things, you make them more salient, which is more likely to grab your attention. And so you get a
380080	386000	self reinforcing cycle until you are drawn into particular patterns of behavior. So self deception
386880	392880	drives, sorry, bullshit drives self deception. But of course, the more self deceived we are,
392880	397920	the more easy it is to bullshit us because the more easy it is to get us to be unconcerned
397920	403120	with the truth, because that of course is one of the deleterious functions of falling prey to
403120	409200	self deception, we get disconnected from a proper pursuit of the truth. So we got this culture and
409200	415520	with self deception and bullshit are reinforcing each other and becoming more prevalent. Now,
415520	421520	Paul record has argued or talked about what he calls a hermetic of suspicion. And this was given to
421600	430800	us by Freud and Nietzsche and Marx as prototypical thinkers of this ilk. And for all of these
430800	438320	thinkers, we are they give us arguments to the effect that appearances mask self deception,
438320	445120	they mask a hidden motive, a secret agenda, or a deceptive covert manipulation.
446080	451600	That's why it's a hermetic suspicion, we're suspicious of how things are appearing to us.
453040	458720	However, I would argue that it goes back to the combination of the Copernican revolution
458720	464960	and the Protestant Reformation. So before the Copernican revolution, we have the Aristotelian
464960	471600	notion of realness. And it's basically tested through three, through rule through three rules,
472400	481920	right? And it's is my organ functioning properly? Is the medium clear? Do other people after
481920	486720	reflective discussion agree with me? Now, we still live by this, by the way, we still use this to
486720	494560	determine if what we're seeing is real. Now, this is at the hallmark core of the Aristotelian framework,
494560	501280	but notice what happens with Copernicus, we all have well functioning eyesight. It's a clear day.
501680	507280	We see the sun rise in the east, pass overhead, and set in the west. We all talk, we all agree
507280	514720	that that's what we saw. And we're all wrong. We have to remember how terrifying that is.
515840	522080	We've gotten so used to it, we, and that it has, it is so inseminated itself into us at an almost
522080	528400	unconscious level. But it expresses itself in a deep suspicion. Because if that's, if that,
528480	534720	if that can fail the test, what else is failing the test? What else is passing all of our intuitive
534720	541920	judgments about what is real? And nevertheless, turn out to be illusions. The Protestant Reformation,
541920	549200	of course, taught us that we cannot trust traditional institutions. We cannot trust their
549200	555840	sense of right and wrong. We are thrown back upon, ultimately, individual conscience. Now,
555840	560800	that may not have been Luther's original intent, but that's not relevant to my argument right now.
561520	565280	What we end up with is we get the isolated individual trapped behind
566240	571600	sense experience, where that sense experience is understood as the veil of appearance. I was taught
571600	577920	this repeatedly in my undergrad in philosophy as a central issue with which we had to contend,
577920	589440	the veil of appearance, and an ongoing anxiety about skepticism and solipsism at the heart of
589440	596640	what we were trying to do. And of course, the scientific revolution and the Protestant Reformation
596640	602960	and this concern with skepticism and solipsism come to a particular fruition in Kant and the
603040	609440	tremendous impact, and he called it his Copernican Revolution, he had on the intellectual
609440	614560	and spiritual development of what we now call, probably inaccurately, the West.
616160	622400	In all of this, appearances became unmoored from reality and from social structure.
622400	632000	But of course, they are still, nevertheless, salient and compelling.
634400	641120	That is part of our inevitable embodied experience. So notice what we have here,
641120	647440	we have appearances that are unmoored from reality and social structure. We are deeply
647440	653520	suspicious of them, yet we find them still salient and compelling. This is super bullshit.
654160	662480	The culture as a whole is in a place where the appearances are disconnected from realness,
662480	665760	yet they are still compelling and driving our behavior.
670160	676640	Now in order to protect ourselves, I propose or I'm arguing, from this we seek to tame and control
676720	684800	appearances and make ourselves invulnerable to them being used to manipulate us. This is
684800	690000	the great question, of course, it has been put on methamphetamines by the advent of social media.
692480	697760	How would we tame appearances, make them easily accessible back to the smooth
697840	705360	and and make it so they do not claim or intend to claim or pretend to claim to
705360	711760	pretend a deeper reality. They are superficial and they glory in being superficial, the smooth.
714080	718320	How do we seek to control them? Instead of being controlled by these appearances,
718320	726480	they will be completely manipulated by us. They will be completely in control of us.
726480	736960	They are solely for our use, back to the smooth. Of course, and this was what reflection and research
736960	743520	show, this is ultimate bullshit in our attempt to not fall prey to bullshit.
745600	752320	We actually fall deeper in it because this strategy of the smooth, the smoothing of appearances
752880	761200	distracts us from the fact that the reduction of beauty to the smooth is precisely in service
761840	768880	of mass marketing manipulation, as we all wear our logos that look the same,
770000	778080	saying how individual and unique we really are. So we have super bullshit being responded to
778080	787040	by ultimate bullshit. This, of course, is a very difficult and problematic situation.
788320	794080	What this argument is intended to show is that the reduction of beauty carries with it
794080	800240	considerable epistemological and ethical loss and risk.
800400	810800	But we're not trapped in the hermeneutics of suspicion. This is a point developed by Marlowe
810800	818160	Ponty extensively through his writings, but it ultimately goes back to a deep discussion
819120	828240	by Plato that appears in many of his dialogues. But I'll use Marlowe Ponty's presentation of
828240	838400	it because it is clear and accessible. Illusion is a comparative concept. It's like tall or small.
839040	845040	It's dependent on the experience, the realization of reality. I can only say this is an illusion
845040	852720	if I can say because it is not this which is real. It is a contrastive comparison. In fact,
852800	858240	technically it makes no sense to say all is illusion. That's like saying everything is tall.
858800	864480	It doesn't make any sense. Typically what people mean is all of sense experience is
864480	871520	illusion in comparison to some X that is taken to be the reality. But there's always a comparison.
872720	879920	So illusion is when appearances mislead us away from reality and they are dependent.
880480	888960	Illusions are dependent upon when appearances lead to reality within acts of realization.
889680	895120	And I want you to hear both meanings of that word coming into an intelligible understanding
895120	899040	and awareness and becoming real, disclosed as real.
902320	907520	Now this is one of Plato's central proposals given this realization.
908240	917760	Beauty is when appearances disclose reality. That is beauty proper. We can realize in both
917760	929280	senses of the word, the world through beauty. Because beauty is when appearances lead to
929760	939040	reality and lead us to reality. And they have to be primary. They have to be more real than illusions.
941760	950000	Now note here, this requires us giving up a lot of the subjectivist and smooth notion of beauty
950000	957840	that we have been given in a post-continent mass marketing world. Beauty does not have to be pleasant.
959920	966640	It can be striking or haunting. Platinus repeatedly makes reference to this possibility.
967280	975040	Rilke in some of his great poetry talks about how beauty is terror that could kill us, but deans not to.
980560	988160	But it is always a moment of insight, seeing in to things, seeing through illusion and in
988160	997040	to reality. And this of course is part of what Platinus conveys in his argument is about beauty
997040	1005200	and intellectual beauty, the two ineod's. There is a moment when you realize that what appeared
1006960	1014080	as relevantly real, the moment of insight, you thought something was relevantly real
1015040	1022080	and then you go, aha! What was salient to me was actually misleading.
1024080	1030320	It was wrong and notice the normativity in here. I thought I was apprehending her as
1031120	1037840	angry, but she's actually, notice the language, she's actually afraid and therefore I should
1038160	1043760	adjust how I'm apprehending her and interacting with her.
1047680	1054160	Notice this realization has a normativity in it, a call to responsibility and action.
1056400	1062160	The aha moment carries with it a flash of salience as one sees into reality. There's a
1062160	1065920	lot of cognitive science around this and I won't go into it. You can look at my published work
1065920	1068240	and my work in my on my published videos.
1071120	1077760	Somehow one is more right. In fact, we find insights so compelling in this way. We tend to be
1077760	1083760	biased. We tend to judge reality in terms of whether or not they were produced in our judgments,
1083760	1091680	were produced in an insightful manner. When sees into reality, one is more right in both
1091680	1099920	an epistemological and an ethical sense about reality. One is correct and in right relationship.
1102320	1111440	We need to be very careful here. Beauty is in the act of realization. What may be disclosed
1111440	1119040	could be great evil. One of my favorite paintings, and I don't use slides so I'm not going to put
1119040	1124240	up a slide. I hope you've seen it. If you haven't, you could look at it later, is Picasso's Guernica,
1125280	1132560	which is a painting of the bombing by the fascists of a town in Spain during the Spanish Civil
1132560	1138720	War, I believe in 1937. It is in many ways a horrifying painting.
1141200	1146160	Now Picasso's Guernica is trying to cut through all the proper and bullshit
1146160	1152240	around war and bring us into a full presence of the full presence of the event.
1153920	1159680	Collingwood would talk about this in the work of art, how it takes us out of a categorical way
1159680	1167680	of thinking. This is one battle among, no, the actual suchness of this event coming to full presence
1167680	1175600	of its full presencing. There's a reciprocal opening. The whole of the self is involved in
1175600	1180720	opening up to a deeper and deeper apprehension of the reality. And there's a reciprocal opening,
1181360	1184720	which of course is an instance of Platonic anegarge.
1189120	1199120	What I'm saying is it is a beautiful disclosure of evil. But this should not be confused with saying
1199200	1205520	it portrays evil as beautiful. It portrays evil as evil beautifully.
1209040	1214560	We love the painting. We love the painting. We treat it. We don't destroy. Look,
1214560	1220720	it's evil before us. Destroy it. It's evil. We don't destroy the painting. We honor it. We
1220720	1226960	hold it sacred. I believe it's now being hung in the United Nations. It's a sacred object.
1227200	1232800	We love the painting. And in that, therefore, in some important way, it is beautiful. The act of
1232800	1245040	viewing it is beautiful. Not pleasing, but beautiful. Plato's second great proposal about beauty is that
1245040	1254960	beauty can not must connect us to reality in a way that helps educate us in wisdom and virtue.
1256960	1264240	Beauty affords self-transcendence, anegarge, as I mentioned earlier. This is echoed in the work
1264240	1269200	of my friend D.C. Schindler, especially in the Catholicity of Reason and Love in the Postmodern
1269200	1273120	Predicament, where he talks about the three transcendentals. And remember, they're all
1273120	1276880	convertible. They're not identical, but they all interdefine and interpenetrate each other.
1277440	1281760	The primacy of beauty, the centrality of goodness, and the ultimacy of truth.
1282560	1289840	The primacy of beauty. Beauty is how the otherwise abstract reality of the Eidos, which is often
1289840	1299920	translated as the form, the forms in Plato, first reaches into sense experience. But how? Well,
1299920	1309360	Eidos actually means the look or aspect of something. Remember that. Now, think about when I ask you,
1309360	1316240	what is a bird? Well, it's feathers. It has wings, beak, and it flies. So I'll pile a bunch of feathers
1316240	1320800	here, put a beak, some wings, and I'll toss them in the air. They're flying. That's a bird, right?
1320800	1326960	No, it's a horrific mess. Because what's missing is the structural functional organization
1326960	1335040	that makes it into a bird. It's Logos, a notion that Plotinus will use that he properly gets
1335040	1343680	from the Stoics, as Kevin Corrigan has argued, the Logos, this Eidos. But notice it's a way of
1344400	1350320	looking at it, but the seeing isn't visual seeing, at least primarily.
1352960	1356560	Because you have to understand that this structural functional organization is not
1356560	1362640	just the synchronic structural functional organization, it is diachronic. Look, you actually
1362640	1371760	don't ever fully see an object. You can't fully see it. And all of these different aspects,
1371760	1376800	all of these different looks are held together by something that is not any aspect at all,
1376800	1382560	but a through line, a through line that is one with, but not conceptually identical to,
1382560	1390320	that structural functional organization. That's what the Eidos of something is. And beauty is
1390320	1397120	when the Eidos is being disclosed in our awareness of something. Now, Roussin, in his
1398000	1402240	really important book, Bearing Witness to Epiphany, is trying to integrate phenomenology
1402240	1407440	and Plato back together. And he talks about the musicality of intelligibility. He talks
1407440	1412880	about the fact that when we're making sense of things, there's a rhythm that we need to pick up on.
1413680	1418880	There's a rhythm, right? There's a rhythm going through this. And there's a melody. All of the
1418960	1422560	different instances are like notes. They're not identical, but they all belong together.
1422560	1428000	And there's a harmony. There's an organizing, unifying principle to it. This is the musicality
1428640	1435760	of intelligibility. And intelligibility is our primary way of determining what realness is. So
1435760	1442320	realness and intelligibility and musicality are bound up together.
1442400	1452800	When we have an insight into the form, we're leaping into a Gestalt. Not just the
1452800	1458480	synchronic Gestalt that's in our mind, but the diachronic Gestalt through the musicality
1459120	1466080	of intelligibility, of our experience of a thing. This leaping into the Gestalt is what
1466080	1480240	Zewicki talks about in the experience of meaning. So notice what we're saying here. Stoic notions
1480240	1486160	of beauty are often, and I don't know her name, and I wasn't here for her earlier talk because,
1486160	1492000	as I said, I'm not feeling well. I don't know if it's Salkite or Kalkite. I apologize for any
1492640	1502080	pronunciation. Makes a good case for Stoic beauty as Sumitria. Not exactly the same as our notion,
1502080	1506240	current notions of symmetry, better understood as proper proportioning.
1507600	1514720	Another notion is Ratio, which is at the heart of our word rationality, because rationality is
1514720	1521040	the putting of things into proper proportion, properly proportioning our attention and care.
1521120	1531360	And by doing this, we cut through illusion and into reality when we properly proportion our
1531360	1541600	attention and care so that we can track the through line, follow the Eidos, then we cut through
1541600	1547040	any possible illusion and appearances in the musicality of intelligibility,
1547760	1557440	beautifully disclose an underlying reality. This is why Crecipius can say only the beautiful is good.
1563040	1571280	Connecting to the real rational order of reality. This is onto normativity, a term I've coined for
1571280	1577840	the fact that people find the really real, inherently good and they will transform their
1577840	1586160	lives, their relationships, even their identity to be in closer communion and conformity to that
1586160	1592960	really real. And of course, this lines up with the Stoic proposal that the universe itself
1592960	1601120	has a logos and that logos is sacred and divine. And we are to come into an ongoing,
1601680	1611760	dare I say it, musical, joyful flowing with that logos. Marcus Aurelius, of course, is aware of
1611760	1618640	appearances disclosing reality and their relation to beauty. He says, we should remark the grace
1618640	1623360	and fascination that there is even in the incidentals of nature's process when a loaf of bread,
1623360	1628160	for instance, is in the oven. I know there's been another talk on this crack appear in it here
1628160	1633680	and there and these flaws, though not intended in the baking, have a rightness of their own
1634320	1643040	and sharpen the appetite. The cracks, flaws, breaking in a simple notion of symmetry,
1643040	1649600	and their unintended breaks in the surface structure, have a rightness about them.
1650800	1655360	Notice that language, the rightness, I've been talking about this all the way through,
1656000	1661760	a rightness that sharpens the appetite. Isn't that of course what beauty does?
1663680	1668880	The appearance of the cracks literally opens up the surface of the bread to the depths.
1669120	1675120	And this enhances our desire to come into contact with the bread.
1678480	1684960	Part two, sorry, quote two. An angry look on the face is wholly against nature.
1685680	1691040	If it be assumed frequently, beauty begins to perish and in the end is quenched beyond
1691600	1699760	rekindling. Why is an angry face against nature? Because it is a face that discloses passion
1700320	1707840	and not the logos that is essential to our humanity. A face too often angry can lose its beauty.
1709440	1715520	It no longer rightly discloses the core reality of human nature.
1716160	1724960	But let's examine more closely this realization through beauty that I have been arguing for.
1731520	1738080	Scarry, in an important book, an amazing book, I would put it on beauty and being just,
1738720	1742800	talks about how the experience of beauty prepares us for seeking truth and justice.
1743680	1750000	She gives an example of seeing a beautiful tree and she goes through the phenomenology very carefully
1750000	1754640	and she says, the inside is something like, I didn't realize trees could be like that.
1755840	1762480	Now, I'm going to do something, if you'll allow me to use a self-referential adjective,
1762480	1767760	verbakian about this. I'm going to put this into cognitive terms of sense making.
1768720	1774560	So, I didn't realize trees could be that. So, we have all of our previous experiences of trees,
1774560	1779280	all the different instances, all the categories and they're converging on this new entity.
1780720	1787280	And it somehow is disclosing the Eidos, the underlying reality of what trees really are.
1787280	1793200	I didn't realize trees could be like it's realized. And what that does is that opens up
1793280	1799200	possibilities for us, new ways of seeing and relating to trees in the future. So,
1799200	1808720	notice these movements. You've got a convergence to a realization of form of Eidos that is,
1808720	1817920	right, can be used in many different, it can find and formulate and reformulate problems
1818640	1825760	as we encounter trees in the future. Now, if you take a look at the work on
1825760	1832000	making sense and explanation, there's a couple things that come and the work on plausibility,
1832000	1838720	a couple things come out. This notion of convergence, we like convergence of independent things.
1838720	1849520	Or why? Well, if my realization comes through just one, let's do sense experience,
1849520	1854400	comes through just one sense channel, I see something, but I can't touch it or hear it
1854400	1858080	or feel it. It might not be real, it might just be a subjective illusion.
1859440	1865920	But if I can see it, touch it, hear it. In fact, the more senses I can get,
1866640	1871680	the more I'm convinced it's real. Why? Now, this is not an algorithm, it can go wrong,
1871680	1880320	but why? Because the more convergence I have, the less likely it is, the less probable it is
1880880	1886400	that my realization has been produced by subjective illusion or bias. So,
1886400	1893760	convergence gives us what Rescher, in his 1976 book, plausible reasoning, calls
1893760	1899200	trustworthiness. The opposite of bullshit gives us trustworthiness.
1901120	1904400	Of course, we know why we want IDOS, we've already talked about that.
1905520	1911280	What is it when a realization can suddenly be applied to what were previously many disparate
1911280	1916880	domains? This is making use of the philosopher of science, Kicher, some of his work on stringency,
1916880	1921280	but I will argue, in fact, I'll just have to claim I've got arguments elsewhere. This is what we
1921280	1929120	mean when we say a scientific claim is elegant. I've had an insight that can go to many otherwise
1929120	1934640	diverse. Four sequels mass times acceleration can be used to talk about planets, balloons,
1934640	1947200	blue whales, accelerating cars. Wow, that's elegant. Ben Milgram in his astonishing book on
1947200	1953760	practical induction, how we acquire new desires, not new beliefs, but new desires, argues for a
1953760	1961440	balance between our backward and forward commitments. What does that mean? If I'm going to promise a lot
1961440	1970880	of elegant problem solving going forward, I need to have a lot of convergence to my realization
1970880	1978000	or claim. If I have a lot of promise without much convergence, I get the conspiracy theory,
1978000	1983440	the far-fetched claim. If you only believe that the British royalty are lizard people,
1983440	1989440	look at everything that I can explain. What's the opposite? We have lots of trustworthy
1989440	1995440	convergence, but no elegance, no power. That's triviality. Trivialities are not false.
1996000	2002160	They are not worthy of your attention. So notice what we have in plausibility,
2002160	2009280	in good sense-making. Notice all the aesthetic terms, terms deeply associated with beauty.
2009280	2015840	We have convergence, a coming into oneness. We have the emergence or the emanation of
2015920	2020480	idos or form. We have elegance and we have balance between them.
2024720	2031440	Plausibility is the beauty of good sense-making, and we are deeply attracted and moved by it.
2031440	2038400	Now plausibility isn't probability and it isn't certainty. Plausibility is what you should take
2038400	2044320	seriously. What is a good proposal, where you should look for the truth?
2047680	2055600	Turning it around, beauty is sensory motor, plausibility that can be taken up into cognitive
2056720	2059440	plausible, therefore beautiful sense-making.
2060000	2067840	So, plausibility, what you should take seriously, what you should care about,
2068720	2076080	the reasonable promise that salience is tracking reality, the opposite of bullshit. And of course,
2076080	2082000	Socrates famously argued for a rationality of care. He knew ta erotica. He knew what to care
2082000	2088160	about. He knew what he didn't need. He knew what mattered. The unexamined life is not worth living.
2088160	2091760	And of course, this lines up with other more recent work by Frankfurt,
2091760	2097600	the importance of what we care about and reasons for love. And my extensive, sorry,
2097600	2103120	I don't mean to be self-promotional. I just want to indicate trustworthiness, work on relevance
2103120	2108960	realization. You are different from computers because computers don't care about the information
2108960	2115360	they process. You care about some information rather than other information and therefore you
2115360	2120560	take care of it because this is all part of you taking care of yourself and other people.
2124000	2128800	Lipton makes a very strong case in his book on inference to the best explanation for
2128800	2135600	the primacy, the primacy of plausibility. What do I mean by that? Well, think about an experiment.
2136720	2140880	I have to come up with a hypothesis. Do I generate all possible, logically possible
2140880	2147840	hypotheses? No, that is combinatorially vast. I pick ones that are plausible.
2148480	2153600	When I'm designing my experiment, I have to worry about confounds, possible alternative
2153600	2161600	explanations. All the logically possible alternative explanations? No, that is uncountably large,
2161600	2167840	only plausible alternative explanations. What implications do I draw from my data?
2167840	2175040	All logically possible implications? No, those that are plausible. Plausibility is primary.
2176160	2183280	It is before, during, and after all scientific investigation and labor.
2186480	2194960	Rationality depends on the orienting beauty of plausibility. Plausibility is good sense making,
2194960	2202160	grasping the significance of information well, grasping the, the significant of information
2202160	2208560	well, caring about the information in the right way. And that's what we actually mean by understanding.
2208560	2214560	Look, knowledge is about evidence. Understanding is about the relevance and significance about what
2214560	2221040	you know. Plausibility and understanding are mutually defining. Here's the connection. Good
2221040	2227040	sense making is the beauty of plausibility. That produces understanding. That gives us the
2227040	2234000	musicality of intelligibility, which of course affords good sense making. That is the cycle
2234000	2239280	that we are constantly running through. It's all a cycle of beauty.
2242000	2248960	Marcus Aurelius, dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars and see yourself running with them.
2251920	2258800	Dwell. This language is not the language of just belief. It is to be with
2260240	2266640	and to run with. This is participating in the beauty in the very way in which you are
2266640	2275520	contemplating the highest or deepest realities. Beauty is primary because it reaches into our
2275600	2284720	sense life and our sense making and prepares us for truth and affords us seeking it.
2287760	2292080	In this way, beauty, and I've already alluded to this, beauty is anti-bullshit.
2296320	2301360	Beauty helps us discern through bullshit and tutor us how to care well.
2301680	2305440	What to take seriously? What matters?
2307360	2312880	McGee and Barber in 1999, this ability to see through illusion into what's real is the hallmark
2312880	2319120	of wisdom. This was taken up in the consensus paper that I was a co-author on with many other
2319120	2324320	people led by Igor Grossman in 2020. The science of wisdom in a polarized world, no one's an
2324320	2330000	unknown. This ability to see through illusion into reality is central to wisdom.
2332320	2341680	I propose to you that virtue requires discernment knowing what to take seriously and what to care
2341680	2346640	about with insight and deep understanding. And when we have that, we have wisdom.
2347440	2357520	In the symposium, Plato proposes that virtue is a higher order of beauty. We first notice the
2357520	2363760	beauty of the beautiful person, then we moved to beautiful institutions, then to the beauty of
2363760	2373840	virtue. How is virtue beautiful? Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.
2374800	2378800	There are multiple competing interpretations of the Socratic
2379360	2383680	proposal of the unity of the virtues, but I take this one to be the most plausible.
2383680	2387520	Each virtue is a way to be wise in a particular situation.
2390400	2395040	It is like to be wise in this situation is to be courageous, to be wise in this situation is to
2395120	2404880	be compassionate. The virtue is a proper proportioning, a ratio of attention and care,
2404880	2409680	the rationality of attention and care, so that one homes in on what is most
2409680	2417040	relevantly real in that situation. Think about the stoic emphasis on posage and prochiron.
2417040	2422400	It's all about tailoring us so we can do this, tutoring us and tailoring us.
2423120	2431920	Each virtue is how wisdom proportionally and properly therefore appears in a particular
2431920	2442160	context. Virtue is the beautiful appearance of wisdom. Virtue is how wisdom proportionally
2442160	2449440	appears in a particular context to best disclose the most relevant truth in that situation
2449440	2455840	and how action is appropriate to it. Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.
2459360	2464000	Virtue is the beauty of wisdom.
2467360	2475280	Think about all of the stoic practices, premeditatio, what Hado calls objective seeing,
2476240	2483120	the view from above. What are they all designed to do? They're all designed to get you to pay
2483120	2490080	attention to how the alteration of how you're finding things salient can be
2492080	2499120	more properly attuned to the underlying reality and that often we are confused
2500080	2505680	because we fuse inappropriate caring with the underlying reality.
2510160	2521840	But we can learn to have what we find salient, what we take seriously, properly tutored
2522000	2528560	so that salience tracks us into what is real, not just in our thoughts but in our whole
2529360	2535440	sensibility, our whole sense making, our whole comportment, our whole existential orientation
2536000	2543680	and stance towards reality. This of course is the cultivation of virtue and wisdom.
2545760	2551040	All of these practices, they may disclose things that are very unpleasant, the premeditatio,
2552560	2558400	doesn't disclose something, oh death, the fatality of all things. I could lose my loved one tonight.
2559440	2568000	It's not a pleasant experience. But what does it do? Well, some research on this shows is that
2568000	2576000	when you do something like this, it releases people from mortality salience. If you just trigger
2576000	2584000	people about their mortality, they will get very close-minded, very rigid, very defensive
2584000	2591120	of their worldview. But if you move it into a reflective practice in which you imagine that
2591120	2598880	you're dying and all the people are around you and then you ask yourself what really matters here
2598880	2604080	in this most real of real moments and people don't say their possessions or their power,
2604080	2608240	they say their relationship and because the people they care about are there,
2608240	2615680	they become open and flexible and loving. This is a beautiful practice even though what is
2615680	2622720	disclosed is not something that we like or prefer or find smooth. In fact, we are doing our damndest
2622720	2630880	in our culture to try and smooth over the reality of fatality, the fact that at any moment reality
2630880	2638320	can smash in to your most narratively cherished projects and our ultimate mortality. We try
2638320	2646240	our best bullshit around this. But the historic practices can open us up.
2648000	2658960	They can be beautiful practices that lead us into a deeper ability to be connected to reality.
2658960	2665840	What would that be? A connection to reality that has rational apprehension, plausible sense-making,
2665840	2670720	and by the way, you see here that rationality does not reduce to Cartesian logic. I'm talking
2670720	2676400	more about overcoming self-deception appropriately, proportioning your attention and care to the world.
2676960	2683520	What would that be? That sense of connectedness to reality that is fundamentally good,
2683760	2695120	that is not pleasant or pleasurable. That, I put it to you, and I think LaVine is right about this,
2695120	2701760	or LaVine, that is joy, something the Stoics actually talk very frequently about. And of
2701760	2706480	course, we've reduced it. Think about what we've done even to the word enjoyment. We've reduced it
2706480	2717040	to a synonym for experiencing pleasure. But moments of great joy can be very unpleasant.
2719760	2722560	They can be beyond pleasure. They can be other than pleasure.
2726000	2733440	One way in which we can get a notion of joy is some of the current work I do, which is the flow
2733440	2738320	experience that has been talked about by Chick-Sent-Mahai. The flow experience is when you're
2738320	2745760	doing jazz or martial arts or rock climbing, you get this tremendous narrative nanny,
2745760	2751600	super ego thing in your head. How am I doing? What do people think of me? How's my hair?
2751600	2757280	Was my shirt okay? How am I doing? What's my status now? Am I safe? Is there anything interesting
2757280	2762320	for me? What am I getting out of it? All of that falls silent because you are so deeply connected,
2762320	2767680	and there's a there's a reciprocal opening, an anagogy. The world is super salient to you,
2767680	2771360	and you are committing more and more of yourself to it, but you're not being bullshit,
2771360	2778160	exactly the opposite. You're being led into an intimate causal efficacy and connectedness to
2778160	2788480	the world because error really matters in the flow state. You're at one. Although you may be
2788480	2795760	exerting tremendous metabolic energy, you feel graceful. It feels magical. People seek out this
2795760	2803840	experience. They will reliably tell you it is not. It is not pleasure. Think about rock climbing. It
2803840	2811040	is absurd. You climb up this rock surface. You're hurting yourself. You're putting yourself at risk
2811040	2816480	of injury. You're exhausting yourself only once you get to the top to come back down. It sounds
2816560	2821440	like a Greek mythological torture in Hades. People do it because it gets them into the flow
2821440	2827440	state. They have, I've argued with Leo Ferraro and Anna Herrabenet that what's happening is an ongoing
2828240	2834160	insight cascade. Like you're constantly getting more and more insight into what's going on,
2834160	2838960	and it's calling deeper and deeper into you. You're getting this anagogic at one minute. It's a
2838960	2845760	deep state of joy. It is not pleasure, and it can be very painful in a lot of ways what you're
2845760	2855040	doing in that state. Sparring is painful. Rock climbing is painful. And yet people do this.
2855040	2860240	It is an optimal experience. It is the best experiences. Many people say it's the best
2860240	2865040	experience they have, and it is where they are at their best. And it is a universal. You find it
2865040	2873200	across cultures, linguistic groups, socioeconomic status, gender identification, continental
2873280	2880160	dwelling, etc. People describe this experience in similarity at the level of detail. This is a
2880160	2889360	universal. It discloses something essential about our functionality. We are made for joy, which is
2889360	2897920	not pleasure. We are made for this deep one minute, and it is a profound experience for us
2897920	2906560	because it gives us an intimate, deep connection to our reality that is disclosing itself as
2906560	2913440	overwhelmingly beautiful. There's an ongoing sense of super salience, but not deception,
2913440	2918880	a super salience that is making us love what is happening, falling in love with us. There's
2918880	2925760	ongoing disclosure and discovery, and we're tapping into the inexhaustible intelligibility
2925760	2933920	of reality. Seneca, even when painted into a corner, it is possible to leap into the sky.
2937600	2943520	The disciplining of attention and caring, cutting through self-deception in rational
2943520	2953040	virtuous realization, potentially putting us into a profound flow with nature, another stoic theme,
2953040	2964000	is a deep enactment of beauty. That is how beauty is implicit in all of stoicism.
2964800	2966560	Thank you very much for your time and attention.
2969360	2975520	Ah, John, thank you so much. Everyone, a round of applause in the chat for John Rovegi.
2976800	2980960	John's going to linger with us for a while, but I'm also aware, John, that you're not feeling
2980960	2985360	your best, so we'll maybe take a couple of questions and see how we go. Are you okay with that?
2986080	2992400	Yeah, let's say 15-20 minutes. I think I've got enough cortisol in adrenaline
2992400	2995840	and enough flow that I can hang on for a bit longer.
2996960	3005920	I want to say, wow, John, that was elegant. You mentioned that, wow, elegance. That
3005920	3013200	exclamation of, wow, is that an exclamation of awe and is awe the experience that might be a sign
3013920	3020480	of beauty, plausibility, et cetera? How do we feel that? How do we recognize that?
3020480	3029120	So, awe is tricky. I think wonder and wonder flow are definitely experiences of plausibility
3029120	3035360	and intelligibility. Awe's a little bit different. We thought it would just be
3036240	3039600	that sort of just more, but we're running some experiments to show
3041200	3045920	if awe was just that, like what's happening in the flow state, you would expect people to
3045920	3051760	demonstrate very increased measures of cognitive flexibility after you induce the awe state in
3051760	3057760	them, and we're not finding that. Now, one of two things might be the case. Awe is really ephemeral,
3058560	3064400	and that's a real possibility, so take that seriously. Secondly, even if the awe state is
3064960	3071280	persisting long enough that it should be impacting cognition, and this second proposal is my
3071280	3074880	favorite because for the completely biased reason that it lines up with my argument,
3074880	3080400	there's probably an intervening thing that is needed. What awe does is it's one of the few
3080400	3089360	positive experiences of the shrinking of the self, and if that launches you into the training of
3089360	3098640	epistemic humility of reverence, then that would probably predict many of the traditional predictions
3098640	3104160	of how awe improves people. So, this is very much an experimental work and a theoretical
3104160	3107840	debate work in progress, so that's the best answer I could give you right now.
3108320	3116320	I think, did you say with the Marcus Aurelius quote, it's not to dwell on or dwell with beauty,
3116320	3123680	the stars? Dwell on the beauty of that. That's the translation I have. So, is that an intellectual
3123680	3130960	relationship? Is there an embodied relationship? I think the Stoics, and I mean, I'm going to
3130960	3134240	speak anachronistically, I'm going to use some of my language for them. I think the Stoics are
3134240	3138960	very concerned with perspectival and participatory knowing. They are not just concerned with
3138960	3143040	propositional knowing, and this comes out, of course, in their continual refrain that
3143040	3149280	philosophical discourse is not the same thing as the proper love of wisdom, because love involves
3149280	3153520	what you care about, what you find salient, how you're noticing and oriented in the world,
3153520	3157840	and how you are committing and binding your identity to something. And I think the welling
3157840	3162400	therefore should be understood as pointing towards that perspectival and participatory knowing.
3163120	3166880	Okay, I have one more quick question from me, and I'm going to jump into the chat because we've
3166880	3176320	got some questions. Could you just clarify how to recognize triviality versus plausibility?
3177040	3184320	Sure. So, plausibility is when you have a balance between the convergence. Many different things
3184320	3191120	give converge to this realization and the elegance. There's lots of convergence to lots of elegance
3191120	3198320	and lots of instantiation of an Eidos, right? But there has to be a balance between them.
3198960	3202320	When you have a lot of convergence, but not much elegance,
3204400	3211760	then you have a triviality. Can I give an example? Buses stop at stoplights. Okay.
3213280	3217040	Yeah, you know, you've got a lot of converging evidence for that. You've probably seen it happen
3217040	3222880	multiple times. Many people will agree with you. Lots of independent collaboration. You don't take
3222880	3228640	that as a great scientific insight. Buses stop at stoplights. Yeah, and notice what you want to
3228640	3233920	say here. And what follows from that? What comes from that? Where's the elegance? Well,
3233920	3239280	there is no elegance, and that's what makes it trivial. That's why the person who spouts triviality
3239280	3244960	is a bore. They're not lying, but they don't say anything that has consequence for us.
3245200	3250080	Hmm. Okay. Well, thank you. That was really clear. All right, I'm going to jump into the chat.
3252320	3256720	Something that Dave Murray said, it's not a question, but it's just an experience. And
3257600	3263840	yeah, I'm going to start with that. So he said, met a guy just like this at a biker. This is at
3263840	3269760	the beginning when you were talking about Harry Frankfurt and Bullshit. Met a guy just like this
3269760	3275840	at a biker bar a couple of weeks back, slung all kinds of bullshit, wanted me to believe him.
3275840	3281360	He got very upset when I would not agree, haven't been able to stop thinking of that encounter since
3281360	3287200	not sure I handled it well, felt like I should have clapped along, but not to agree in felt I
3287200	3293760	should have clapped along, but not to agree internally. All right, so any comments for Dave
3293760	3299520	on that interaction? Thanks, Dave, for that. Yeah, Dave, that's, I mean, that's a really tricky
3299520	3304800	situation, especially if it's a stranger. And so you don't have much sense about what you can expect
3304800	3311840	from the person, you know, is there actually, you know, an implicit possibility of an escalation
3311840	3316400	potentially into violence or harm. And so I understand, you know, there's care to be taken
3316400	3322720	here. And there's a there's a cost benefit analysis, like, is it going to cost you much to
3322800	3328800	challenge this person? If, if please hear the if, if it does come to be the case that there might
3328800	3335440	be a good reason to challenge. This is where I think learning Socratic practice is really important.
3335440	3339760	This is what I do in a lot of work I do around dialectic and to the logos. Socrates was very
3339760	3345840	good at drawing people into the depths of their bullshit, only to have it fall apart in their
3345840	3351440	hands, so that they would experience a poria. Now that in itself is a dangerous thing to do. And
3351440	3355840	of course, we all know what they did to Socrates. But the thing is, because a poria gives you a
3355840	3362400	choice point, you can either retrench even more deeply. And that, right, that is a real possibility.
3363280	3372160	Or you can do the following, you can open up, you can experience wonder, which is to open oneself
3372160	3380080	up to call one's world and oneself into question in a beautiful way, in a wonderful way. And so
3380160	3387120	I would again, please hear all the caveats I put before it. But there are times when people are
3387120	3394400	bullshitting. Perhaps a relationship is at risk. And somebody is bullshitting. This can often happen
3394400	3402880	in couples therapy. The therapist often needs to use techniques, largely Socratic in nature,
3403680	3410080	to try and get the person into a place where they are willing to
3410720	3416000	disidentify from being a bullshit artist in an important way. See, the problem, as I said,
3416000	3420240	with bullshitting, and we all know this, the problem if you bullshit a lot is you start to
3420240	3423680	believe your own bullshit, you don't really believe your bullshit, you fall prey to it.
3425520	3430720	And so getting people to break out of that cycle, it can be very challenging. But that might be an
3430720	3439200	instance where doing, posing a Socratic challenge to bullshit might be really necessary, or at least
3439200	3446880	highly indispensable and needful at the time. Don, you said we can't believe our bullshit.
3448080	3453360	But we repeat, we say bullshit enough that it just becomes more salient and therefore.
3453360	3459760	Right. And then we engage in action, which causes us to have certain beliefs. So technically,
3459760	3465200	we don't believe our bullshit. Our bullshit leads us into being locked into what we find
3465200	3471920	salient. And then our actions are what cause our bullshit. We can't, sorry, cause our beliefs. We
3471920	3477920	don't, we can't act a belief. But our actions actually cause our beliefs. And so in that way,
3477920	3486960	bullshit channels our actions, and then those cause our beliefs. And Pascal, and I don't mean
3486960	3491840	to say he was promising bullshit, but Pascal was aware of this. When he gave Pascal's wager,
3491840	3496080	he didn't want, he said very clearly, I don't think it will convince you of God's existence.
3496080	3500320	What I noticed how this is a really sneaky plausibility argument, what it should do is
3500320	3504640	take, make you take seriously going into church and lighting a candle, because he knew if he
3504640	3509840	started to do these things, then things would become salient to you. And then the beliefs would
3509840	3516240	start to accrue, even though he could not give you any argument for them. Yeah. Yeah. And, and
3516240	3520800	that's what Marcus Aurelius is doing quite a bit. He's kind of always piecing through things that,
3520800	3524320	that veil of appearance when you said that I'm thinking of that piecing through
3524320	3530160	that veil to get to the reality of the food on our plate, the wine in the bottle, etc.
3531120	3532720	Let me move on to another question.
3535440	3540080	Mark, Mark Trumbull says, what is the relationship between beauty and confirmation bias?
3540400	3549360	So that's a very tricky one. And there's a sense in which some more empirical research is needed
3549360	3559760	at a couple of lynch points. I think confirmation bias is a kind of pornography. And in fact,
3559760	3565760	I think you can even talk about confirmation porn. And in that sense, it's given my argument
3565760	3571920	in my use of Han, it is antithetical to beauty, which should startle us and wake us up and make
3571920	3578480	us ask questions and prepare us for truth that we do not yet have. And so in that sense, beauty,
3578480	3582880	as I've argued for it here, which of course is not our everyday notion of beauty, I've taken great
3582880	3587760	care to do it, I did distinguish that, right? Beauty in the sense I've been arguing here would be
3587760	3594320	the opposite of confirmation bias, which is a kind of cognitive pornography. Yeah. Now,
3594320	3597840	you have to be careful about this because you can't, this is what I cannot tell you.
3598560	3605280	Don't ever engage in confirmation bias, because that would mean I would rob you of heuristics
3605280	3610960	that you need, because what these heuristics, when they're adaptive, what they do is they help you in
3610960	3616640	situations, ignore a lot of irrelevant information, focus in on the relevant information. The problem
3616640	3621200	is for every instant, and this is a formal proof that no free lunch to the theorem,
3621200	3627440	for every instance where that heuristic helps you, there's another instance where it equally harms
3627440	3635840	you. And so you have to get good at ameliorating this and seeing the bias or seeing the heuristic
3635840	3644000	in context. Thanks, John. I'm just noting the questions in the chat, and I see one from Stacy.
3644720	3651280	Stacy says, would you say the smoothing, and that's in quotations, the smoothing of reality
3651280	3658240	has created a society that generally has a disdain for or denial of the necessarily complex,
3658240	3665440	or do we have a yearning at an individual level that can supersede the superficiality created,
3665440	3672000	the superficially created smoothing? So I think the answer to the first question is yes,
3672000	3676000	and I think that's Hahn's argument, so it's more his argument than mine, that the smoothing
3676960	3683760	locks us into a superficial simplicity instead of a challenging elegance.
3686080	3691520	About the second point, I think, of course, no one swings free of cultural influence,
3691520	3696320	but we know there are individual differences, and we know that one of the things in which
3696320	3703360	there are individual differences is need for cognition. This is how much do you need to go out
3703360	3707920	and find problems rather than just waiting to react to problems that are given to you by
3707920	3713520	circumstance or other people? Do you seek out problems and challenges that have not been given
3713520	3719360	to you by reality or by circumstance? And by the way, need for cognition is predictive of
3719360	3724880	rationality. Your intelligence is only weakly predictive of rationality, and if you want to
3724880	3728320	see about that, go look at a whole bunch of other work that I've done and worked by Stanovic
3728320	3734880	and a whole bunch of other people. So many individuals have a kind of constitutional resistance
3735600	3743920	to the demification, the stupification that is happening, and what they do is they seek
3743920	3750240	to complexify their cognition because they have a high need for cognition. Now, that is probably,
3750880	3757520	in some sense, perennially true, but it is also more pertinently true right now because,
3757520	3764880	as I've indicated, we have the technological and social acceleration of the strategies of smoothing.
3766880	3770480	Yeah, thanks, Joan. People that have high need for cognition
3771120	3775600	and seek rationality need to seek each other out and find community and mutual support.
3776160	3782320	So, obvious reference to the group here. Yeah, that's what we're trying to do here.
3782880	3786720	I'm going to take two more questions from the chat, everyone, and one question from my co-host,
3787760	3794960	and hopefully that's going to be good, John. Leonard says, what to do in cases in which authentic
3794960	3801040	natural salient beauty is indeed misleading? Do you recommend specific contemplative practices
3801040	3806080	to recover from self-deception stemming from being blinded by beauty?
3807920	3814000	So, you have to be, I understand the question, and I'm not being dismissive of it.
3815280	3822160	Typically, what we mean is, let's say, for example, a woman is naturally very beautiful to
3823600	3828640	a heterosexual man, just as a prototypical example from literature. I'm not giving it any
3828640	3836720	moral priority at all. And we say, but that beauty was actually deceptive because she was evil,
3837840	3843040	or manipulative, or a liar, and all the horrible tropes, and I know there's sexism bound up with
3843040	3850560	this, but that has been a prototypical instance of it. Now, you have to be very careful because
3850560	3857040	what the natural sexual beauty discloses is actually something like, there's good reason to
3857040	3864400	believe symmetry in the modern sense of the person's appearance and healthiness of their appearance.
3864400	3870640	And those are both indicators of, sorry, I don't mean to sound crude, but this is sexual attraction
3870640	3877440	we're talking about. Those are both indicators of good capacity for sexual reproduction. And so,
3877440	3886720	in that sense, there was no deception. Now, what we can do is we can fall prey to the halo effect,
3886800	3892240	which is conclude that because the person is naturally attractive, that they are also morally
3892240	3898880	virtuous. Now, that thing, the halo effect, you should definitely engage in contemplative
3898880	3906080	practices to get to more reliably challenge. The halo effect is very, very dangerous. Now,
3906080	3910400	you can see why it evolved because halo effects, people that are attractive will largely
3910400	3917040	marshal social influence. And if they marshal social influence, you better think well of them
3917040	3924320	because social power, et cetera. So, we can understand why it's an evolutionary adaptation.
3924320	3933280	But nevertheless, if we could all learn to more successfully challenge the halo effect
3933280	3942240	and retailer our salience radar, it would do us all very well. And by the way, it helps the people
3942240	3947920	who live by the halo effect because eventually it goes away. And I know people like this.
3948800	3957600	And then they're really bereft. They're really bereft. I had, I noticed I was, like many of us,
3957600	3962000	I had been unsuccessful in the people that I had entered into a romantic relationship with.
3962720	3969680	So, this next time I decided to do something pretty stoic, I think, not to praise myself,
3969680	3977360	but I decided I'm going to challenge my default automatic attractiveness radar, what grabs my
3977360	3983920	attention in women, the type that I like, and I'm going to go off type. And so, I met somebody
3984880	3991360	who I'm now with, one of the best people I've met in my life. And I fell in love with her soul
3992160	3998160	first because of that. And then I've only come to realize, not only through my own eyes,
3998160	4003120	but the eyes of others, that she's actually a physically very attractive woman. And this has
4003120	4010800	been the best for me that it could possibly be. So, if we are being really careful about what
4010800	4018560	we're pressing on here, something like the halo effect, yes, yes. I think it's good to challenge
4019200	4024000	the halo effect. I don't think that's a particular problem with beauty. I think it's a
4024000	4030240	particular problem with our judgments about how we are leaping from, and this is inappropriate
4030240	4037840	leaping, right? There's good leaping and bad leaping, leaping from the disclosure of some
4037840	4048640	underlying reality, a kind of capacity for sexual reproduction to making conclusions about
4048640	4052800	people's moral character. That's where we need to pause and to challenge.
4054160	4060720	hugely helpful answer, John, and thank you for your question. Okay, one more question from the
4060720	4067360	chat, and then one more question after that, and we're done. So, Geon has a good little question
4067360	4073120	for you, John. Could you share methods to question myself if I am bullshitting or not?
4074800	4081120	So, the first thing to do is to adopt a practice of active open-mindedness.
4081920	4086800	Learn about various cognitive biases, and then first, and you'll find this very easy and pleasurable,
4087440	4094400	identify cognitive biases in other people in newspaper articles or videos or in other people,
4094400	4099360	and you'll be really good at it, and I want you to remember this. You'll be really good at it. We
4099360	4105120	are really good at detecting cognitive bias in other people, and then try and apply that to yourself,
4105120	4110960	and you'll find that's really hard and you're not very good at it. That's because the Cartesian
4110960	4117840	monological model of how reason works is dramatically wrong. Reason works socratically,
4117840	4123440	it works dialogically. I'm good at identifying your bias, you're good at identifying mine,
4123440	4130320	and so what we need to do is regularly engage in socratic dialogue, dialogue with each other,
4131440	4137920	and so we get more and more capable of doing that, and then eventually, you will start to more and
4138080	4143840	more internalize that into an internal dialogue. Remember what Antistony said, he learned to
4143840	4151200	converse with himself from Socrates, and eventually, you will internalize that ability
4151200	4157120	to take other people's perspective on your own perspective, and then you will start on your own
4158000	4164080	to be able to do active open-mindedness. Oh, that's brilliant, John. Again, I just want to
4164080	4167840	bring up Marcus Rades here. I notice that sometimes he does this little dialogic thing,
4167840	4172800	he asks a question and then answers it. It's thoughts to himself, right? The meditation is
4173760	4179600	a dialogical exercise, a dialogical exercise to go through. Yeah, yeah, thanks. That's a great
4179600	4185200	question, Geon. Thank you. All right, I'm going to invite my co-host, Phil Yanov, to the stage to
4185200	4191920	ask the final question, John. Over to you, Phil. All right, John, thank you for being here today.
4191920	4197360	Thank you for hanging out with us and sharing your thinking with us and letting us ask you
4197360	4202240	questions. It's just been a real gift. I'm going to tell you, I can't wait to go watch this again.
4202240	4209120	I'm glad we're recording this so I can come back and revisit this. And I'm sorry that you're feeling
4209120	4215360	poorly, but I'll make one last question, one last question. I look forward to your question,
4215360	4222160	Phil. I really enjoyed our conversation earlier. So thank you. And I did too. And so I'm going to,
4223040	4229600	you know, we've been talking about beauty and stoicism and it's, I feel it's a romantic notion
4229600	4234400	and you've got lots of thinking and we got to put all those pieces together. But I would love
4234400	4243440	to hear you reflect a little more upon a statement I heard you make in another interview where you
4243440	4250960	said that, you know, stoicism was kind of a gray area. And what you were saying was,
4252320	4257680	maybe it was a religion. And I was trying to get to the thought of what is your thinking in
4257680	4262320	was stoicism a philosophy? I mean, they see themselves as the heirs to Aristotle, right?
4262320	4266560	Or is it a religion or was it somewhere in the middle or were they bullshitting themselves
4266560	4274960	about what they were really doing? This is wonderful. So I mean, this is a question other
4274960	4279360	people have wrestled with I've looked at I haven't read it thoroughly. So I don't want to claim
4279360	4285920	competence in it. You know, entire PhD thesis around this question. And it goes around what's
4285920	4290880	called the demarcation problem in the social sciences about religion. We don't know what we're
4290880	4295440	we have by the way before we go see religion, we have the same problem with science, the demarcation
4295440	4299840	problem also exists for science. That's it's very hard to say that's a science and that's not.
4299840	4304560	So the demarcation problem for religion is well, what's a religion is going to a sports stadium
4304560	4309360	where you go on a specific time with a whole bunch of other people and you cheer and you yell
4309360	4313520	and you eat together and you chant and you're rooting for these people that are doing
4313520	4318080	something that in no way changes the real world. Is that a religious action?
4318080	4325120	Yes, and that's the right answer. The right answer is me. Is Buddhism a religion? Well,
4325120	4329920	it could be a philosophy, but it's not right. It's not a philosophy in modern academic sense
4329920	4338240	of philosophy, but it's it's a love of wisdom. Right. And so I think stoicism is I often use
4339200	4346240	the the phrase, the hyphenated phrase, it's a religious philosophy or a philosophical religion.
4347040	4354080	Because I think trying to come down hard on a demarcation, it has practices, it has rituals,
4354080	4360240	it has community, it has a sacred dimension that you are supposed to come into a participatory
4360240	4367040	relationship with that transforms you profoundly. I think this is a reason why stoicism was taken
4367040	4374960	up and becomes a proper part of Neoplatonism, which has found a home in many religious traditions.
4374960	4380080	Right. Of course, there's Neoplatonism within Christianity, within Islam, within Judaism.
4380080	4387120	And of course, there is there's really weird historical inter integrations between something
4387120	4395120	like Neoplatonism and Vedanta and Buddhism. And so this amazing capacity to enter into
4395120	4400400	reciprocal reconstruction with other religions and religious philosophies, it tends to
4400960	4406560	to make the religions more philosophically deep and tends to make the philosophies more
4406560	4412800	religiously transformative. And so I think, you know, I think, I think you have Aristotelian
4412800	4417680	science and Neoplatonism, I think you have platonic spirituality that spends that sense of
4417680	4425120	an agage that I talked about. And there's the mystical. And then stoicism, I think,
4426080	4435200	it gives you a lot of practices that I think are crucial. I'd be more happy saying that, you know,
4435200	4442400	Platonism is a religion, but I also think it is more properly described as a philosophical religion
4442400	4448960	or a religious philosophy. What's interesting, I wasn't looking for a definitive answer from you.
4448960	4454880	I wanted to hear your thinking on this, because I think it is exactly that demarcation problem
4454960	4459120	and part of it is too. And I've heard you comment on some other things is that, you know,
4459680	4465680	there is a hunger for some binding of ourselves to some other philosophical tradition,
4465680	4469520	which is the thing that you talk about a lot. And I think that's kind of what we're seeing here.
4469520	4475440	Yes, there is. And I think this whole, if it's not presumptuous, but I think you're at least
4475440	4481440	affording this, Phil, I think this whole conference is around the sense of religio to be deeply
4481440	4486800	connected to something that is profoundly and transformatively and beautifully real
4486800	4491760	that helps us find the centrality of goodness and the ultimacy of truth from the primacy of beauty
4491760	4499760	to use DC Schindler. Now, the one thing that I think is interesting, and the problem is the
4499760	4507280	history gets a little bit hard here, is, is there a place, was there a place for the mystical
4507840	4513520	experience that is clearly explicitly present in Neoplatonism? You see it in Plotinus without
4513520	4520640	question. And of course, it's controversial around whether or not the mystical that sense of, you
4520640	4529600	know, a profound at one mint with reality is actually something that Stoics report on. I don't
4529680	4539760	know. I think that part of the history is perhaps lost to us. Maybe it gets submerged under the
4539760	4545440	emerging Christianity, maybe gets submerged when it's taken into Neoplatonism. I don't know. I don't
4545440	4553440	know. I do think that flow with nature, especially if it has connections to what I talk about as flow,
4553440	4559040	I think it's on a continuum with more proper transformative and mystical experiences.
4560000	4564880	So do you, and I apologize, but I'm going to get one more question, one more answer out of you.
4564880	4570240	That's fine. Do you think those, you know, the, the Zeno's flow and, and I can't say the guy's name
4570240	4574560	Mahila. Chicks have my eyes. Yeah, check. I, you, every time you say it, I think I should record
4574560	4580640	that. So I can say it, but, but those two uses of flow, do you think those are similar enough
4580640	4589120	to have that conversation? Yeah, I do actually, because I mean, the, the, we tend to over focus
4589120	4593840	on prototypical instances of flow that come out in athletic performance or martial arts or rock
4593840	4598720	climbing, but it also comes out in jazz and it also comes out when you're doing dialectic into
4598720	4605040	the logos and practice. And we're following the logos the way Socrates says you follow the wind.
4605040	4613840	That, to my mind, is an ongoing practice of insight, improvisation, re-questioning, reopening up
4613840	4619920	an ongoing sense of discovery and wonder. And that seems to me to be very much a flow state.
4619920	4625040	Error matters. Socrates will catch you out. You have to be very clear. There's immediate feedback.
4625040	4628560	These are all the conditions that create flow. I think being in Socrates presence,
4629760	4634640	if it was taken up correctly, which is always the existential choice in the face of Socrates,
4634640	4640160	could induce a flow state in people. Don is following the wind, the same of sort of stream
4640160	4645040	of consciousness, thinking, journaling, writing, following the logos, following the wind.
4646880	4651600	What do you mean by following the wind? Oh, I just thought I thought, I thought you said
4651600	4657360	following the wind. No, following the logos, like, like, like, like, like a wind, right? Like a wind.
4657360	4661920	Yeah. It blows and it comes from another direction that we have to reorient. So
4661920	4666400	Socrates talks about following the logos as if we're following a wind. Yeah. And of course,
4666400	4670480	I just thought it just reminded me of kind of a stream of consciousness type following of our
4670480	4676880	thoughts in that way. No, I don't think see flow is typically different from associational,
4677680	4685840	like, like that associational thing, because it requires it flow really cares a lot. And there's
4685840	4691360	a lot more I could have put in my talk. We flow really cares and is afforded by a concern for
4691360	4696720	intelligibility. If things start to be not make make not make sense for you, you immediately
4696720	4701280	fall out of flow. If you start to make a lot of mistakes, you're immediately out of flow.
4701280	4707040	That's the thing that will snap you out of flow like nothing else. Yeah. All right. I think we
4707040	4711600	also have a t-shirt. Well, you're feeling well. I want to bring you back for more questions about
4711600	4716240	this particular set of things. But thank you so much for your time today. This has been
4716240	4723200	thanks, John. I think we have a t-shirt phrase. Beauty is anti bullshit. John Varvage.
