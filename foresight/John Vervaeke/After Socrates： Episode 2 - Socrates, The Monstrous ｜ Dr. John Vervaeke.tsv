0	9400	Educing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself, that is to be on
9400	12160	the horizon of wonder.
12160	19480	It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question so a
19480	43720	new self in a new world can deeply be born.
43720	46920	Welcome back to episode 2 of After Socrates.
46920	51920	First time we looked at four ways we are after the way of Socrates and we also reviewed
51920	56120	the basic format of the series.
56120	62280	Now let's continue being after Socrates.
62280	69080	Right now at the beginning as we orient ourselves to find our way, let's follow Socrates.
69080	75600	In order to follow Socrates we have to understand how he understood himself and this is going
75600	80440	to be perplexing.
80440	89760	Socrates' self-knowledge, he found himself and frequently described himself as a tipos,
89760	99360	not belonging to any particular category, like our word atypical but deeper, more powerful.
99360	105560	He explicitly refers to himself sometimes and Plato has other characters refer to him
105800	113840	in terms of monsters, as monstrous, he's like a satyr, he's like a stingray, he compares
113840	119800	himself to a titan, many different kinds of monsters, this is a recurring thing across
119800	124320	many of the dialogues.
124320	136200	Namely, he describes himself as metaxu, as fundamentally in between, in between the human
136200	137200	and the divine.
137200	143080	I'm going to come back to that because Socrates never thinks that he becomes anything other
143080	149960	than a human being, so he says we like him, at least he's challenging us to realize that
149960	159840	we like him, are somehow in between human finitude and the transcendence of the divine.
159840	167080	Drew Highland, excellent book and we'll come back to it, talks about finitude and transcendence
167080	170680	in the platonic dialogues.
170680	176240	Socrates does something really interesting when he says that he's metaxu, he says so
176240	188200	is eros, eros isn't a human but it's a transhuman force, it's not a god, eros is a daemon, d-a-e-m-o-n,
188200	198760	not a daemon but a daemon, a being that is between and therefore mediates and unites
198760	204040	the human and the divine, just think about it, isn't there something really insightful
204040	207280	in that about love?
207280	220200	So Socrates he understands himself as fundamentally liminal, he's within and without, sort of
220200	226280	fits our categories but he doesn't, he's monstrous, the monster takes the normal categories
226280	235800	and distorts them in a way that is startling and challenging and disruptive.
235800	250640	Somehow Socrates transcends our normal framing in a way that is challenging and even at times
250640	254760	threatening.
254760	260800	How is Socrates within and without, how is he liminal, how is he monstrous in a way that's
260800	267880	constantly challenging and threatening to us but nevertheless beneficial to us?
267880	277920	And how does he do this while never claiming to be anything other than a mortal?
278920	287920	A mortal doomed to die human being.
287920	294400	So Socrates enters into these intensive in terms of how he's involved with people but
294400	301680	extensive in terms of how much scope they take in, how much they zoom in and zoom out,
301840	309680	probative conversations with people.
309680	315480	And in these conversations questioning, not just questions, questioning, it's even better
315480	322600	perhaps to hear a related word to questioning, questioning.
322600	328360	Questioning plays a central part rather than concluding.
328360	336160	These exploratory dialogues are often centered on what is virtue, what is wisdom, related
336160	342280	things, what is knowledge, what is goodness, what is real?
342280	344360	And these are questions and this is the importance.
344360	348200	These are questions we cannot ignore, this is why we cannot ignore Socrates, we can't
348200	353280	ignore these questions, we can pretend to ignore them, but then we're just giving answers
353280	361440	to these questions given to us implicitly, unconsciously, automatically and we reactively
361440	370480	acting them out rather than acting on principle.
370480	389080	Yet these dialogues frequently and frustratingly and profoundly inconclusively, inconclusively,
389080	395280	everybody including, really hear that, including Socrates, they've been talking about courage
395280	396280	at the end of it.
396280	406680	Everybody says, I don't know what courage is, including Socrates.
406680	422080	Socrates claims to have achieved human wisdom in that he, by practicing this kind of dialogue,
422080	431880	has come to know that he does not know and we go, what, that's it, we're all ignorant,
431880	441640	I know, there's tons I don't know, well how is this, what's going on?
441640	447760	Socrates doesn't mean that generic belief.
448760	456680	Existentially in the situation, specific realization in both senses of the word, it's a palpable
456680	464440	reality and one is coming to a deep understanding awareness of how one is ignorant in this situation
464440	473280	in a way that matters because one has been pretending deeply, unconsciously, automatically
473280	480960	reactive to know, know both the situation and know oneself relevant to and relative
480960	482640	to that situation.
482640	485200	This is a profound kind of realization.
485200	492120	It requires disciplined mindfulness.
492120	503920	He has cultivated, and this is going to become an important phrase, he has learned, learned
503920	504920	ignorance.
504920	509720	In fact, when I say learned ignorance, I want you to hear both pronunciations, learned and
509720	510720	learned.
510720	513360	He has learned ignorance.
513360	526720	He has become aware of his ignorance in a way that makes a huge difference to specific
526720	534400	actual concrete situations.
534400	539560	So let's explore the dynamics of this a little bit better.
539560	543480	So we have, on one pole, we have conversation.
543480	547200	Socrates is engaging in a conversation.
547200	549160	I want you to start to get a feel for this.
549160	553480	I want you to think of those conversations you've been in, where you're asking each other
553480	557320	questions and you're not giving sort of pat answers.
557320	562760	You're really opening up, a person's opening up and you're opening up, you're reciprocally
562760	567160	opening, and the conversation starts to take on a life of its own.
567160	574200	And it's not wandering aimlessly, it's wandering fruitfully, and you both find you're getting
574200	581360	to places and having insights, realizations that you couldn't have had on your own.
581360	586280	When the conversation comes to an end, you say, that was one of the greatest moments
586280	590760	of my life.
590760	593120	Socrates is like that.
593120	597480	He talks about it.
597480	600880	You may not get that sense when you're reading the dialogues, because it seems like there's
600880	603360	a lot of conflict and argumentation.
603360	611240	But Socrates says, in more than one place, but in one space specifically, he says, I'm
611240	616560	willing to follow the logos, dia logos, and we're going to come back to, what is this
616560	618040	logo he's talking about?
618160	623640	But he's willing to follow the logos wherever it goes, like the wind.
626760	628160	Isn't that amazing?
628160	631160	The wind.
631160	638160	It seems to have a life of its own, but the wind, spiritus, wind, inspiration, aspiration,
638160	639920	spirituality.
639920	645360	When Jesus is talking to Nicodemus and telling him he has to be born again, he talks about
645360	648320	the wind is like, the spirit is like the wind.
648320	652760	It comes and goes as it would, and you know where it's coming from, and you don't know
652760	657200	where it's going to, but you can get caught up in it and follow it and breathe it and
657200	661480	been inspired to aspire by it.
661480	667480	That's one pole.
667480	676560	It's important to realize that Socrates is being just as surprised by the way the conversation,
676560	678480	the dialogue, is going.
678480	685880	He's just as much surprised by the dia, by way of, by means of logos, the dia logos as
685880	692200	anyone else participating, and you'll see how much he comes to deeply value this.
692200	698560	He's not experiencing this just as rough, you know, back and forth adversarial thing.
698560	703200	There's a deeper thing going on, and you'll see this in what he says about this practice.
703200	707240	Now, this is one pole.
707240	709880	The other pole is this learned ignorance.
709880	713680	You say, what's, like, why is that valuable?
713680	716560	Well, think about it.
716560	725240	What the dia logos is doing is it's taking you to the horizon of wonder.
725240	728800	Securiosity is when I don't know something, I need that information, there's a gap in
728800	732280	my knowledge, hey, look, this fills it, and now I'm done.
732280	736480	I have what I need.
736480	743680	It's very much as Fromm would say in the having mode, but wonder, at least the way Fuller
743680	749960	and others argue about it, wonder is the being mode.
749960	754520	You come to the horizon, now think about the horizon, you can actually never reach it,
754520	760620	but there's a horizon, and at the, when you look at the horizon, you have a sense of what
760620	766880	is within your understanding, but how it is, how it is on the cusp of what is beyond your
766880	774440	understanding.
774440	777200	The horizon of wonder.
777200	780040	Socrates famously said that wisdom begins in wonder.
780040	782320	Why, what's going on?
782320	786880	In wonder, you're not filling the hole.
786880	791000	You're opening it up to the horizon.
791000	800400	You are calling yourself and the way you have framed the world into question, but in a way
800400	807160	you feel called to, in a way that is somehow beautiful to you, that is drawing from you.
807160	811520	This is, the word for it to draw forth is educe, this is where we get the word education
811520	813760	from, but think of it, it's a different kind of education.
813760	819040	This isn't here's, the knowledge you need, and so you can service the workplace and the
819040	822040	market until you die, and otherwise meaning was death.
822040	824360	They don't mean education like that.
824360	833440	You mean inducing, going through the labor pains of giving birth to yourself.
833440	837400	That is to be on the horizon of wonder.
837400	844760	It is to be in a place in which you are calling yourself and your world into question, so a
844760	850560	new self in a new world can deeply be born.
850560	857080	That is what's going on in this process.
857080	863480	So notice, there's a discipline.
863480	866800	What does the word discipline mean?
866800	868200	It means to follow.
868200	869960	It means to track.
869960	877960	It means to follow and track so that you are transformed by that following.
877960	888560	There's a discipline to following the logos, dia logos, letting it call you into question,
888560	892880	letting it call your world into question, so that you and the person you're in dialogue
892880	897840	with are giving birth to yourselves, mutual midwiving.
897840	906240	Socrates was clear that he was not only examining others and helping them give birth to themselves.
906240	908920	He repeatedly emphasized it was reciprocal.
908920	913360	He was also examining himself and giving birth to himself.
913360	918160	They were mutually interwoven.
918160	932400	So the discipline of following the logos that allows us this mutual midwifing allows the
932400	948520	logos to take on a life of its own and thereby transform the way we are living.
948520	957880	Socrates, and it's often talked about using this practice called unlinkus, this questioning
957880	961680	and answering and probative.
961680	967560	And as we'll see, the unlinkus slowly in the hands of Plato becomes dialectic.
967560	973720	This disciplined following of the logos, this mutual midwifing and affording of the logos
973720	983440	to take on a life transforming life of its own.
983440	986680	So we've got a discipline.
986680	989840	So there are a set of practices.
989840	999080	Let's call those with Plato dialectic, this is not Hegel's dialectic, this is a way of
999080	1006840	structuring dialogue in a disciplined manner so that it will take on the features of the
1006840	1007840	logos.
1007840	1014040	So there's a practice, there's something we can do dialectic, it's doing this mutual
1014040	1023720	midwifing and affording the presencing of the living logos.
1023720	1032360	That practice can result in a process that we do not make.
1032360	1039160	It's a process between us and between us and the world, the taxu, and it's like eros,
1039160	1047080	it's like love, especially in the platonic sense.
1047080	1056120	You don't make love, well we do say you make love, but what I mean by that, let's think
1056120	1064200	of it as analogous, oh it's a kind of love itself too, in fact it's a kind of platonic
1064200	1065200	eros.
1065240	1070360	Platonic love, friendship, profound friendship.
1070360	1073120	You can't just make somebody your friend.
1073120	1079920	You can't say you're my friend now, that's it, I've decided it, I make it so.
1079920	1082880	That's in fact, that's going to go nowhere, in fact it's probably going to have the opposite
1082880	1083880	result.
1083880	1089880	You can't just sort of passively wait around, someday a friend will come, somebody will
1089880	1094880	come up to me and say I'm your friend, probably not.
1094880	1104360	That's why we use metaphors of like falling in love, growing in love, we participate in
1104360	1105360	it.
1105360	1114480	So it's a practice we can do, we can discipline ourselves, to follow the logos, to mutually
1114480	1120760	midwife, to afford the logos taking on a life of its own.
1120760	1130400	That's dialectic, but the process of the logos is not something we do, it is something we
1130400	1138840	participate in profoundly, the way we participate in love, friendship, it is between us and
1138840	1142160	between us and the world.
1143160	1154040	The practice of dialectic, the process of the logos, that's why Fowler put in both
1154040	1165640	the logos and dialectic in the classical tradition, but there's also a state, here's
1165640	1171120	the the logos and learned ignorance and they're mutually affording each other, the the logos
1171120	1180000	gets us to the horizon of wonder and that opens us up and makes it possible for us to
1180000	1184640	reciprocally open with each other and reciprocally open with the world and then that affords the
1184640	1195760	logos and the the logos affords learned ignorance and we cycle the practice of dialectic, the
1195760	1204360	process of the logos and the paradoxical state of learned ignorance.
1208360	1215760	But is not all of this problematic, you should say to me, you should say, this looks like
1215760	1222760	you know a lot of knowledge, a lot of learning and Socrates is claiming, right, that all
1222760	1229680	he knows is that he does not know. That's actually not accurate. Many people put that
1229680	1233680	talk, all that Socrates ever said is that he know that he know, no, no, he doesn't
1233680	1239080	say that. He said that's what his wisdom consists in. Socrates actually claims to know a bunch
1239080	1244120	of things. So first of all, we have to modify it, but then we'll come back to your point
1244120	1250360	because you are making a good point in posing that problem. What does Socrates claim to know?
1250440	1257400	He famously claims to know erotica. He knew he knows about the erotic things. That doesn't
1257400	1262320	mean he's really good in bed or he just knows about sex. He's talking about eros in a much
1262320	1268800	more comprehensive sense about how we seek to bind ourselves to things. And this seems
1268800	1277360	inherent to us. We seem by nature to be looking for things other than ourselves to complete
1277360	1282040	us. And notice how that gets us into self-transcendence. I'm looking for something that's other than
1282040	1288360	me to become me so that I am more than me, but completed as me. And so as you think about
1288360	1294360	this, you start to go, oh, how does that make sense? Hold on to that vertigo. We're going
1294360	1309080	to come back to it. Socrates knows how to track eros. Do you? Well, I know what it's... Yeah,
1309080	1315680	I know you know what it's like to feel eros. I do too. But can you feel eros in a way so
1315680	1322080	that you don't do all the self-deceptive, self-destructive things you've done because
1322080	1328760	of that feeling? Because when you track, you're following, but you're also able to know and
1328760	1337080	see where something is going to go. When you're tracking a storm and following it, you're
1337080	1343280	trying to predict where it's going to go so you can avoid being overwhelmed by it. Socrates
1343280	1351320	knows how to track eros. He knows how to follow the trail of signs. He knows how to properly
1351560	1362560	apprehend and appreciate the significance of eros. He knows what to care about. He would do this
1362560	1366680	provocatively. As I already said, he would go into people and he'd say, why are you spending so
1366680	1373880	much time on your hair and your clothing and how you smell? And so little time on your psyche,
1374120	1381160	so little time on your mind and your soul and your character. You go, yeah, why am I?
1383320	1387480	Socrates would walk into the marketplace and say, look at all the things I don't need.
1389880	1398280	You go, oh, right. Why don't I do that? That's the socratic question. It's a question about
1398280	1405160	Socrates that reverberates back and becomes a question, a wondering about yourself and the world
1406760	1411160	that you live in. So Socrates knows erotica.
1414680	1422120	How can we know this? How can we do this in practice? How can we realize it in practice?
1423080	1431480	We will come back to this. Socrates also, and he states it very confidently, he knows the difference
1431480	1439880	between belief or opinion and knowledge. He knows it. Now, how can he know this when he claims to
1439880	1447640	know that he doesn't know anything? He actually claims to know a lot of things.
1452520	1455800	He knows how to do geometry with Domino.
1459240	1471160	He'll often say he knows how this practice works, how this art, or actually more specifically,
1471160	1475480	more technically, how this technique, how this particular kind of expertise works.
1482120	1490600	See, what Socrates means is he knows how to track, he knows how to follow, he knows how to quest
1490600	1494680	after knowledge in a way that's not just haphazard.
1498040	1507880	That doesn't mean he's got there. He knows what virtue is in a sense the way you know by being.
1512360	1514680	He certainly doesn't claim to have wisdom.
1517320	1525400	But he doesn't claim to be completely ignorant of it. He claims to be a lover of wisdom. There's
1525400	1530440	the connection to love, except this time it's not eros, and this is important. It's philea.
1531080	1535240	It's the kind of love between friends, or even more importantly, fellowship,
1535880	1539880	people working in concert together. He knows how to work with people.
1543080	1552680	In order to be properly oriented towards wisdom. When you really love your friend,
1553400	1557640	when you really love your romantic partner, have you got them?
1560120	1567080	Like, I figured you out. We're done. I don't need to learn it. I got it. We're finished.
1568040	1572120	I've got the perfect framing for you that holds you perfectly in place,
1572120	1576040	reveals everything that there is possibly to know, but I've got you. Yep.
1578840	1583960	I say to you, in fact, if you say that, that's a strong predictor that your relationship is actually over.
1587000	1588040	What are you actually?
1593080	1595880	You have a faithfulness to this person.
1597400	1603800	You know how to follow them, to track them. They're going to change, and you know how to
1603800	1608040	dash. You don't know where they're going. You don't know what kind of changes you're going
1608040	1617000	to go through, how you're going to dance with them. But you keep teaching each other how to
1617000	1623160	follow each other. And the person, although you have a continuity of contact and you're
1623800	1628440	loving them, and they're opening up to you, and you're opening up to them with supercal opening,
1629320	1634920	there's always that which exceeds. It's funny, you can meet people
1637000	1641000	been together for a very long time, and this has probably happened to you.
1641000	1644600	Our friends come up to you and say, you know, I've been with her for like 10 years. And then,
1644600	1649720	wow, I just like, she did that. And wow, totally caught me by surprise. I just, poof.
1650680	1660440	Because you have to remember learned ignorance. How much you really don't know,
1662120	1666280	because of how really dynamically complex another person is.
1668520	1676040	And wisdom and virtue are excellences of persons. And you can never fully know a person. How could
1676040	1683800	you possibly fully know the excellence of personhood? But you can love it the way you love
1684360	1685560	a particular person.
1693800	1702040	Think of the connection between able to really wonder, not in the sense we sometimes overlap
1702040	1711000	with anxiety, but wonder about your friend or your partner to be amazed by them.
1713720	1723640	I'm very fortunate to have a romantic partner that she's one of the best people I've met in my life.
1724600	1730920	And she constantly exceeds. And this is something I have to keep remembering,
1730920	1738280	relearning. Sati, mindfulness means to remember, not in the sense of just recalling, but reminding
1738280	1743960	yourself, bringing that memory into action. Mindfulness, I have to constantly remember,
1743960	1752280	remind myself that she exceeds all of my personal experience, all of my professional expertise.
1753640	1760840	And she does this so regularly. And yes, so beautifully. I have profound friends. You're
1760840	1765240	going to meet one of them, Christopher Master Pietro. Same thing within friendship.
1765880	1786200	Wonder. Love. The cultivation of wisdom. Deep continuity of growing contact.
1788120	1792520	They're all bound together and learned ignorance.
1795640	1802440	Socrates also claims to know two really deep and fundamental things.
1804280	1807000	He famously, in his defense at his trial,
1810840	1815160	knows that the unexamined life is not worth living.
1817880	1821400	He knows this with such confidence that he is willing to die for it.
1821720	1824440	No propositional argument could convince you of that.
1826360	1832120	But somebody with such powerful presence as Socrates was willing to die for it.
1833480	1840200	That's at least challenging. He claims a life without dialectic into deologos.
1842120	1847240	Affording learned ignorance is not worth living.
1847560	1855800	Socrates is as ignorant as we thought when we just thought, oh, he just doesn't know that he
1855800	1862120	knows. He says, I know that I don't know. I'm skeptical of a lot of things. I'm cynical. I live
1862120	1869880	in modernity, postmodernity. No, no, no. This is not knowing that at the same time
1869880	1876280	gives him the confidence to die as he's telling you and I, because I'm feeling it too.
1877480	1884360	The unexamined life is not worth living. And what do you do with that? Think about it.
1887400	1892040	Because I'm sure my life is pretty unexamined. I don't have that self-knowledge.
1893960	1901800	My life's not worth living. Sometimes I wake up at 3 a.m. and he's sort of right.
1901800	1909000	I don't want to think about that. He's saying that. And then relatedly, he's saying
1909960	1918360	that doing this dialectic into deologos and cultivating this learned ignorance, this wonderful,
1918920	1930440	wonder-filled, learned ignorance is the best activity that human beings can engage in.
1930440	1932120	It's the best kind of life.
1937720	1945080	But how? How could a practice that is so frequently frustrating
1946040	1953240	it does not produce conclusions? It does not produce clear answers? It does not give us
1953800	1957320	resolution in the sense of completion and finality?
1960120	1965560	How could that be worth dying for? That sounds like an utter waste of time at best
1965560	1971800	and endlessly annoying and frustrating and undermining of all of our projects.
1971880	1974680	How could that be? How could that be?
1978600	1983080	Savor that question because I've actually returned to the question you asked a few
1983080	1989400	minutes ago and I've made it deeper on your behalf. By the way, that's me exemplifying Socrates,
1990360	1993400	taking your question and making it deeper on your behalf.
1994040	2001400	Take that question in. Savor it. Let it roll around in your mind.
2008920	2012600	Try to feel into its monstrous challenge.
2016280	2020120	Think about how it challenges all of our assumptions,
2020920	2027960	how it crashes into so many of our presuppositions about success and purpose
2028520	2036440	and achieving your goals and completion, consummation, conclusion, and how all of these
2036440	2045000	are so central to a good life. That question about Socrates just smashes into all of that
2045960	2046840	monstrously.
2050600	2060200	How could this Socratic proposal possibly be true in any way? In fact, in any way that we could
2060200	2063240	actually realize in regular practice.
2071000	2079880	But the problematic around Socrates, the way he's liminal, atypous, monstrous is even deeper.
2082360	2088920	Socrates clearly and repeatedly argues for three things. Number one,
2090600	2097800	the best life is the life of virtue. First of all, really how? It's a provocative statement
2097800	2105000	and therefore claiming to know this is again really important. Socrates claims to know that
2105640	2113160	the life of virtue is the best kind of life. He claims to know that virtue depends on knowledge.
2114200	2117560	Sometimes some people have rendered that as an identity claim. I won't do that because that's
2117560	2122840	controversial. But at least virtue depends on knowledge. But what kind of knowledge does virtue
2122840	2128520	depend on? Okay, good question. We'll come back to it. But first of all, life of virtue is the best
2128520	2136920	life. Virtue depends on knowledge, at least a particular kind of knowledge. And then Socrates
2136920	2143800	repeatedly, and we've already seen it, claims that he does not have the knowledge needed for virtue.
2144440	2149240	How do those hang together? How can that be the case?
2151880	2156760	And you can say, well, maybe Socrates, if you put those three together, you can put them together
2156760	2163720	and say, well, Socrates is just realizing he's just kind of a buffoon. And of course, there were
2163720	2168440	people that thought that, Aristophanes famously in his play the clouds.
2173400	2179000	But Socrates claims to know what a good life is such that he is willing to die for it.
2179000	2183480	How does that fit in with that, right? That doesn't fit in with being a buffoon.
2184280	2200600	And Plato clearly and repeatedly presents Socrates as the most virtuous person living the most
2201880	2203880	worthwhile and virtuous life.
2204200	2212920	At the end of the phato, this is the dialogue in which Socrates actually dies.
2218040	2225480	After Socrates is dead, these last words are spoken.
2225960	2237240	Very last words. Super salient. The culmination point of the dialogue. Not really, but yes,
2237240	2243480	here salient, at the end, we're supposed to reflect upon everything else.
2244360	2246600	Such was the end,
2247720	2252920	Echocrates, of our friend. Socrates was just died.
2254360	2261720	Of our friend whom I may truly, wow, call the wisest
2263000	2269480	and justice most just and best of all men, best of all men.
2269800	2272200	Who am I ever known?
2278520	2281320	How is this the case? How could this be the case?
2281480	2300280	How could that learned ignorance give Socrates the knowledge of the good life,
2300280	2302600	the confidence in it, for which he's willing to die?
2306040	2311080	How could that, that thing that challenges all of our assumptions about the good life,
2311480	2314920	how could that make him the wisest, the most virtuous,
2317080	2319720	living the most worthwhile life? How?
2324200	2330680	How could we possibly realize this, understand it, and such that we could put it into practice?
2331640	2342280	When you roll this around in your mind, it feels like a profound paradox.
2345080	2352360	He seems to be not knowing, and yet he seems to have all of the results
2352360	2355240	of the knowing that he says he does not have and does not know.
2361400	2368680	This feels monstrous, doesn't fit in any of our categories. He's not a buffoon,
2368680	2372440	but he's not the typical successful person. He doesn't seem to have knowledge,
2372440	2375480	but he seems to be wise, like what's going on?
2379480	2385000	Now in response to this, and many people have done this, they even do it in the dialogues,
2385000	2390280	Plato repeatedly shows that, you can just reject Socrates.
2390680	2393240	You can say, he's just confused, he's just all messed up.
2395400	2401480	You can just turn away. You can reorient yourself away from the Socratic path.
2406440	2413000	It's easy to do, but that ease is only superficial, because if you stop and reflect
2414280	2420520	at a deeper level, it's actually harder to turn away, to disorient yourself from the Socratic way.
2421560	2430120	When you read these dialogues, and when you start to practice what Socrates does,
2431000	2438520	you see Socrates disclosing so much self-deceptive, pretense, bullshit,
2439160	2445960	misframing, failure to appreciate properly, failure to understand appropriately,
2446040	2455240	failure to love wisely. Socrates is powerful, and you go, I need all of that, and I put it to you.
2456840	2460680	Is this not needed now, more so than ever?
2463480	2469800	Yes, it seems to be. Socrates affords transframing.
2470280	2477000	What do I mean by that? Well, it's a combination of transcendence, transformation, and reframing.
2477000	2485400	You know when you have an insight, and you realize you've been misframing,
2485400	2494680	not properly proportioning and directing your attention, I thought she was being aggressive,
2494680	2500200	afraid. Oh, I've just been mishandling this whole thing. I was mistaken.
2504600	2510920	It's insight. But you can also get what John Wright following Iris Murdoch, and I talk a lot
2510920	2516520	about this in Awakening for the Meaning Crisis, called Sensibility to Transcendence. I can get
2516520	2521960	simultaneously an insight into that person, and a reflective insight into me,
2522920	2527880	that the way I have habitually been framing or thinking about things or being with people
2527880	2535240	also needs to be reframed. And I can be reframing that person and reframing my sense of who I am
2535240	2541480	and how I look at the world. And that means I start to reciprocally open. I start to transcend
2541480	2548680	myself. I start to afford that person to transcend my conception of them. I start to be transformed.
2548680	2551880	They start to be transformed in how they are and can be to me.
2555240	2562680	Transframing. Socrates affords that. And here's the thing. That transframing ability seems to be
2562680	2570760	central to becoming wiser. It seems central to a lot of spirituality. And if we want wise
2570760	2575560	spirituality, and don't we, can we afford to turn away from Socrates?
2579480	2589240	Socrates deeply inspires, affords aspiration of the Platonic tradition, the Stoic tradition,
2589240	2595160	and the Neoplatonic tradition. And all of these are going through significant revivals right now.
2595160	2601560	And for good reason, they are needed in our times. And if they are needed, so is Socrates,
2601560	2607000	because Socrates is at the heart of them. You can't pull apart Plato and Socrates.
2607000	2611880	Stoicism is the religious philosophy or the philosophical religion, I don't know which,
2611880	2618040	what to call it, of internalizing Socrates. At least central aspects of everything I've been
2618040	2628360	talking about. Neoplatonism is, and we'll see this, the profound pathway into the deepest
2628360	2635000	possible learned ignorance. We can't turn away from Socrates.
2637960	2645720	Socrates is like all the other sages who are paradoxical, atypos and strange. If we turn
2645720	2650920	away from Socrates, we turn away from Siddhartha Gautama, we turn away from Jesus of Nazareth,
2650920	2658120	we turn away from Swangsha, we turn away from Lao Tse, we turn away from etc, etc.
2658120	2662840	Can you afford to turn away from all those sages? Are you so confident
2664200	2672600	that you can reorient away from all of them and find the path to wisdom, virtue, meaning in life?
2673080	2683800	Think about it. Be honest. I propose, and this is an honest proposal, in the sense that this
2683800	2689960	isn't my life, this is how I try to live. I propose trying to move deeply into this problematic
2689960	2699240	of Socrates. I want to allow it the real possibility of challenging me, of transforming me,
2699240	2710040	of calling me into transforming. I want to move through, like the through of my lenses.
2710040	2717000	I want to move through this Socratic problematic. I aspire to this. I have tried to dedicate my life
2717000	2730520	to it. To do this deeply, we need to confront further dimensions of this problematic.
2733480	2741800	Socrates does not have a method. So how do we move forward in a practice? How do we
2741800	2752120	forward into the problematic? Is Socrates just Plato's mouthpiece? Are the words of Socrates
2752120	2757480	equivalent to what Plato wants us to get from the dialogue? That's problematic too.
2758680	2762200	The third wave, people like Gonzales and Hyland,
2762920	2770680	just several rapes, just so many people, so many of those books.
2772760	2781000	I'll argue, no. Plato wrote in a dialogue form in which he is only in one, I think in the apology,
2781880	2790360	in just very minor way, actually present. He's absent. He never puts himself in the dialogue.
2791320	2796600	And the dialogue is not there as sort of literary ornamentation around Socrates.
2797640	2801000	In fact, and this will be central to following Socrates,
2802920	2810280	the collective intelligence and the distributed cognition of all of the characters in the dialogue
2810920	2823000	is actually central to us following the Socratic path. Socrates is central. He's important in the
2823000	2833480	dialogue. But he's also in service to the Deologos, the way other people are drawn out, the way other
2833560	2840760	people represent alternative perspectives, alternative ways of being that Socrates takes into account,
2842920	2846840	which is one interpretation, one translation of the word logos, by the way,
2846840	2848840	taking into account, giving an account.
2849160	2858760	One way in which we can understand this is can we
2861480	2867640	get into a flow state, logos with the life of its own,
2869560	2874360	of the collective intelligence of distributed cognition,
2875080	2885720	that has the capacity to cultivate both individual and collective wisdom. Can we be
2886840	2896520	Socrates to each other? Because if we need Socrates to do this, and all of the traditions say,
2896520	2900200	in one sense we do, but in another sense we don't, then of course we couldn't do it.
2901160	2909720	We need to know how to internalize Socrates, both within us individually and between us collectively.
2917240	2925000	One function of the dialogues, I think, and how they're not replaceable by just capturing,
2925640	2929240	this is an argument made by Socrates, and this represents Plato's theory.
2932120	2939480	One function of the dialog format is it affords internalization. What's internalization?
2939480	2951240	This is a notion drawn from Bogotsky. This is the notion that, let's say a child is learning,
2952200	2955400	and for some of you you've heard this before, but for some of you maybe not.
2955400	2958680	How does learning? They're taking a particular perspective on a problem.
2961000	2964280	The adult comes in to try and teach them. I've raised children.
2966680	2970200	The adult has a more encompassing and penetrating perspective
2971560	2978120	that includes but transcends. Hear that, it includes but transcends the child's perspective.
2981800	2993720	But the child does imitate the adult. And as they imitate the adult, they start to
2995560	3001480	enact the perspective that the adult has. As they presence the adult in imitation,
3001480	3007000	they start to fill in the perspective that the adult had on their perspective.
3007560	3013160	And eventually they do this to such a degree that they do not need the adult present. They
3013160	3017720	can do it for themselves, and then they get metacognition. They can step back and reflect
3017720	3022120	on their own cognition. They could perhaps come to know that they do not know.
3026920	3032920	You see that? See, when you're in a perspective, remember when we compared the first person
3033880	3038920	perspective, there's a third person perspective, when you're asking your friend about the problem
3038920	3045880	that they're having. When you're in a perspective, that framing, it blinds you to what's outside
3045880	3050120	the perspective. You can't see the biases of your perspective, and you can't take on new
3050120	3057800	interest beyond your perspective. But when you internalize other people, you transcend,
3058760	3061080	and you get the capacity to itself transcend,
3064360	3070920	you get the capacity to self-correct, to overcome bias, and to orient more properly
3070920	3077560	and appropriately towards reality. But as the child is to the adult,
3079160	3085320	the adult is to the sage, just as a child you needed to internalize adults.
3085320	3095720	As an adult, you need to internalize a sage. Why could you possibly think you're done?
3095800	3118920	Okay, but Socrates problematizes this. What? How? Well, he often speaks and presents himself ironically.
3119240	3127080	In fact, this is one of the most famous aspects of Socrates. He's ironic. Now, he's not ironic in
3127080	3135720	sort of our modern cynical sense of irony, but he's often saying something that's opposite
3136600	3141720	to what he actually holds to be the case, even though he asks people to always state honestly
3141720	3147240	what they believe. So Socrates is often speaking and presenting himself ironically.
3148200	3152760	Imagine if the parent was constantly being ironic with the small child.
3153880	3156600	That's going to destroy the internalization.
3160600	3170040	Socrates' irony seems to thwart the function of the dialogues, which is to help us deeply
3170040	3175880	internalize Socrates, have his perspectival knowing, see the way he sees, realize the way he
3175880	3182120	realizes, have his participatory knowing, transform our character, our identity, the way he does,
3182120	3189400	transform our self-knowledge. But the irony seems to be undermining all of that.
3192920	3199080	Is the irony just so that Socrates or Plato can avoid political censure?
3199240	3205480	People have argued that, but most people, most of the people I've been reading,
3205480	3213400	the scholars I've been reading, saying no. Is it because Socrates can't sort of directly
3213400	3219160	challenge people? There's truth to that, but many of the people that he's talking with know he's
3219160	3224760	being ironic. And he does seem to really challenge them at times.
3230200	3238520	Yet maybe, in a deeper way, irony is actually connected to learned ignorance.
3242600	3246280	And in that sense, it affords the right kind of internalization.
3246920	3251720	I'm going to throw that out, tantalizing, and we're going to give a special place to that.
3253640	3255560	When Chris and I enter into
3258440	3263320	dialogue and hopefully deal logos about Socrates and Kierkegaard,
3264600	3273320	because Kierkegaard reflects deeply on Socratic irony. And other people, especially people like
3273320	3281240	Drew Highland, Kirkland, and his work on the ontology of Socratic questioning, they all do great
3281240	3293720	work around this. So what are some points to ponder, points that we want to reflect upon so that we
3293720	3301000	can realize them in practice? We want to realize on one hand, the dialectic and to deal logos and
3301000	3307720	how it's in this reciprocal relationship with learned ignorance on the horizon of wonder.
3311000	3318280	We want to really let it roll around in our mind, banging and crashing like a loose cannon
3319080	3320440	on a ship at sea.
3320760	3331560	This problematic around Socrates, only by passing through this problematic,
3331560	3340760	this paradoxical problematic, will we have any chance of genuinely following Socrates.
3340920	3351800	And for those of you who follow other sages, Siddhartha, Jesus, Maimonides,
3355960	3363240	I put it to you that following the way of this sage has the real potential
3363800	3368760	to deepen your ability to be a disciple of the sage that you are most trying to internalize.
3371720	3379240	Perhaps even it would be best if you had an inner symphony of sages.
3379240	3385080	One of them can be preeminent. I do not want to call anybody away from a living allegiance
3385080	3389960	that is breathing into them wisdom and orientation towards reality,
3390920	3393320	that's maturing them in virtue.
3397480	3407080	But perhaps a symphony of sages not only will help disclose what any particular sage is,
3408680	3417880	but also allow you to participate in a way of wisdom that allows you to understand
3418840	3427160	not superficial, polite, liberal tolerance or ideological yelling at and not really quite
3427160	3434200	sure you know what it means, diversity or whatever word you're using. These can be good,
3434760	3437880	they can be bad, but I'm trying to point to something more profound.
3441240	3447320	Could you understand other people's sages such that you could enter into deal logos with them?
3447880	3450600	You don't have to agree with them, they don't have to agree with you.
3451880	3455400	You don't have to come to a conclusion if Socrates is right,
3457000	3463000	but if Socrates is right that would still be part of the best, maybe the best kind of life
3463000	3465160	we could live with each other.
3465880	3478520	It is superficially easy to turn away from Socrates and not orient ourselves socratically,
3482120	3487880	but it's actually in reality hard to turn away.
3488120	3498440	Before we move into learning our new practices, rooting and humble wonder,
3499640	3505560	I remind you to continue always doing your dialogical reflection,
3507000	3512120	your imaginal engagement and enactment and your study.
3513080	3517560	So we're going to do two practices. The first one is going to help us build on
3519080	3526280	the mindfulness practice of centering. This first practice is called finding your root.
3527800	3531240	It has to do with developing the right kind of relaxation
3531960	3536360	in your meditative practice. Many people come to meditation because they want to learn
3536440	3546680	how to relax. The problem is our normal way of relaxing is opposite to what we want to be doing.
3546680	3554600	We are making our body more insensate. We're letting our mind slowly shrink and become clouded,
3556040	3562680	somewhat confused, sort of warm and fuzzy until we lose consciousness because the point of that
3562680	3568760	relaxation is to move us towards sleep. We may not go all the way, but that is its function and
3568760	3578360	it often ends in us falling asleep. That's not what we want to be doing in a meditative practice
3578360	3587880	in which we are trying to learn and we're trying to become more aware of the forms, the formations,
3587880	3596520	the functions and the processes within our mind and body. I think of the kind of relaxation
3598280	3606920	that a martial artist engages in. So very often you'll see martial arts. I teach Tai Chi Chuan
3608520	3614680	and you'll see them take a particular stance. They'll bend their legs, they'll sink,
3614680	3619720	they'll sink their arms into a position, they might close their fists, they might have open hands,
3619720	3625800	but they do this thing. It's called rooting. Why are they doing that?
3628120	3633000	Well, they're trying to do two things. They're trying to stabilize
3635240	3638120	their arms, their legs, their body. They're trying to stabilize,
3638440	3646280	but they're also relaxing. So if you tense your arm like this and you touch, you'll feel there's not
3646280	3652040	very much sensation, but when you relax and you find that sort of stable point and you can relax
3652040	3656760	into it, you'll realize, oh wait, this is a lot. I've really increased my sensitivity. So you see
3656760	3665080	what's happening here? The rooting is a kind of relaxation that simultaneously sensitizes the mind,
3665800	3672840	makes it more alert, more acute, but also stabilizes it so it doesn't start running off
3672840	3678440	and getting scattered. So you're trying to get this sensitization and stabilization that are
3678440	3685640	interpenetrating to each other. Now think about how much that would matter in a martial art situation.
3687640	3690760	You're coming into a situation, there's going to be all this unexpectedness.
3691560	3695880	If you start flailing around because of the unexpectedness, you're easily uprooted.
3697560	3703400	If you just sort of lock in, your ability to sense what's going on and respond is lost.
3703400	3709640	You want to find this optimal relationship between sensitivity and stability.
3711240	3714360	Now you may be saying, well, I'm not going to get into any fights.
3715000	3718680	I hope that's right, by the way, because when if you're fighting, even if you win,
3718680	3725640	you lose. You lose a little piece of your soul. So what's the point of, well, the point is transfer.
3726440	3732200	Think about entering into a situation in which you want to enter into a deep dialogue
3733480	3738760	with another human being the way Socrates does. And Socrates is all just sort of scattered.
3739720	3749320	Then his capacity for entering into the deep conversation is lost.
3750920	3756680	But if he's just rigid and closed in upon himself and holding on to his position no matter what,
3756680	3762600	you can't move me, I am so stable. It's true, I can't. But then what's the point of the conversation?
3763960	3767320	How will the dialogue take? How will it lead both people?
3769000	3780600	So you want to be sensitive yet stable, stable yet sensitive, so that you can optimally flow
3781240	3790040	within any situation, especially situations of dialogical encounter. Being able to root,
3790360	3801800	really important. So often when I'm doing these discussions that I have with people and engaging
3801800	3809800	in these Socratic practices in a way that they might not know, I'm doing Tai Chi Chuan. They
3809800	3815080	don't know it. Sometimes they do. I've had people look at one of my videos, especially when the
3815160	3820680	other person was sort of very interruptive or hyperactive, and they'll say, you were like doing
3820680	3828920	really good Tai Chi there. Yes, exactly. I take that as a very encouraging compliment for which
3828920	3836200	I'm grateful because I aspire to that. I aspire to be able to have that rootedness so that I'm not
3836200	3843320	easily overwhelmed, but I can also flow into the situation. I'm aware of what's going on.
3843560	3851560	In the meditative tradition, this is called sitting as still as a mountain, but as alert as a warrior.
3852600	3856840	This is a phrase used, by the way, within Buddhist traditions that are often committed to non-violence.
3860280	3868200	So how do we do it? How do we do it? How do we get that? And how do we learn it in a way that can
3868280	3873320	transfer to most of our life? Well, if you think about Taoism, you can think about
3874040	3881560	that the very famous Yang Yin symbol with the black and the white and the black dot and the
3881560	3888120	white dot and the white dot in the black area, showing that they're flowing. They have this
3888120	3890600	flowing balance and they interpenetrate each other.
3890600	3901480	We're trying to get a mind that is open, yet centered and stabilized.
3903080	3909880	It can flow out into Yang, but it can also return to Yin,
3911320	3914360	and it has these so that they interpenetrate each other.
3914520	3919960	Now, how would you do this practice? Well, first of all,
3922120	3926440	you go through your centering practice. You do all three centers. I won't repeat that now,
3926440	3933960	but you make sure you center mind and body. You center your attention. You center your attitude.
3933960	3940760	Get centered. Now, I'm going to describe the practice to you and what it looks like,
3941320	3945240	what it feels like. Let's say you're centered. Your eyes are closed.
3947240	3949640	I want you to imagine a space just slightly above your head,
3951080	3956200	and then as you inhale, you're expanding in all directions, almost like you were inflating a balloon,
3956920	3962680	a perfectly spherical balloon in all directions. You inhale. This is you opening up. This is you
3962680	3969640	expanding your awareness, expanding your connection to the world. Right? As you inhale,
3969640	3973400	don't hyperventilate, but you inhale and you expand.
3976520	3979880	And then as you exhale, you let everything gather back together.
3980840	3989800	This is the end. You come in. You come in. So inhale, exhale, and then you find that spot.
3991640	3995480	Oh, right there. That's about right. Where it is for you is where it is for you.
3996440	4001720	Don't imitate what I'm doing. Imitate the way I'm doing something.
4004760	4010760	Inhale, exhale. And the last little bit of the exhale and that little space in between the breaths,
4011320	4017240	it's like I'm opening and melting and draining, and I'm coming to what's called the third eye
4017320	4026760	traditionally. And from there, but even from the center of my head on that axis, I inhale out,
4029080	4041640	I exhale in, opening, melting, draining to the throat. Inhale, remember all directions, 360.
4042280	4047160	Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,
4049960	4052200	opening, melting, draining to the heart.
4055880	4060520	Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering,
4062920	4066120	opening and melting and draining to the solar plexus.
4066120	4075320	Inhale, opening, exhale, gathering and falling back towards the center.
4075320	4083000	Yang into Yin, Yin into Yang. Do you see? Opening, melting, draining to this area called the Dantian.
4083880	4087400	This is eventually where you want your breathing to be when you're meditating.
4087400	4093720	Don't force it there. Let it naturally fall there over time. But here you center around there.
4094440	4098280	The tradition says one finger below your navel, three fingers in.
4101720	4107960	I don't know if that's precise, but something like that. Inhale, exhale.
4109480	4116040	And then opening and melting, draining to where that center axis is touching what you're sitting on.
4116920	4122040	Feel that point. Everything is drained there like a pool of liquid.
4124200	4131080	And now you let it sink into the earth. Imagination for the sake of enhancing perception.
4131800	4137800	You let it sink like the root of a tree, rooting. It's sinking into the earth, connecting you,
4137800	4145000	stabilizing you downward, but also nourishing you, energizing you, sensitizing you upward
4146680	4151640	so that you're then sitting as still as a mountain.
4154680	4160760	But as alert, as a warrior. So you center, find your three centers.
4162280	4165880	Go through that rooting practice. You may want to replay that sequence.
4168280	4170360	So I can talk you through it while you're doing it.
4172280	4179080	Once you feel that sweet spot, that optimal grip between Yin and Yang,
4180040	4187000	you feel rooted into the earth, then begin your meditation, following your breath,
4187720	4194280	labeling your distractions, befriending yourself. That is the rooting practice.
4198440	4202760	The other practice is specifically oriented towards
4203640	4208360	the learned ignorance that we've been talking about in this episode.
4210360	4217720	This is a practice that I call the humble wonder practice. Humility and wonder were both
4217720	4228280	central and integral to the Socratic practices, especially the practice of learned ignorance.
4229240	4239160	How does this practice work? I recommend first centering and rooting and doing two or three
4239160	4248200	minutes of basic meditation. Then bring your awareness to your heart area. You can put your
4248200	4251960	hands on your heart. I won't put them right there because I don't want to screw up my mic.
4252280	4260600	Then I say as mindfully, and you've been cultivating mindfulness now, I say as mindfully as I can.
4264360	4268440	There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.
4270600	4274680	There is so much you do not know about your mind, your psyche, your body,
4275320	4278920	the amount of information available to you is combinatorial explosive.
4279480	4286920	But instead of keeping it as a safe, propositional thing you store over here, you're realizing it.
4289720	4294680	There is so much I do not know about myself because of all of the facts.
4296680	4301720	If you want to add all the facts about myself, feel fine. Feel free to do so.
4302680	4309640	Next, there is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the
4309640	4315320	faith. Faith, what do you mean by faith, John? I don't mean your cosmic destiny or something
4315320	4322280	written down. I mean faith in the sense that it's in the word fatal. You're born at a particular
4322280	4327960	time in a particular place. You're exposed to particular people, to particular events,
4327960	4334440	none of which you have control over, and they deeply shape you. If you do not acknowledge
4334440	4341080	your faith in that sense, your inherent finitude, then your capacity for really
4341720	4345480	realizing your self-knowledge is truncated in hamstrung.
4349080	4354840	There is so much I shall never know about myself because of all of the faith.
4358920	4361480	Next, and they're all Fs to help you remember.
4363800	4369720	There is so much I refuse to see about myself because of all of my foolishness.
4373720	4380040	All the processes that make us adaptively intelligent make us perennially and sometimes
4380120	4392760	pervasively beset by self-deception. How often? Be honest. Really honest, please. How often do
4392760	4400280	you really, not in thought or in belief, but actually in perspective and in how you participate
4400280	4405720	in your identity, how often do you actually challenge your egocentrism and the way it might be
4405720	4414440	bias in you? Igor Grossman found, he asked people to describe a really hard problem they're
4415400	4419880	involved in. They inevitably describe it from the first person perspective without thinking,
4419880	4425800	automatic framing. And then if you say to them, and think about Socrates here, questioning people,
4425800	4431800	if you say to them, well, can you re-describe that problem from a third person perspective,
4431800	4438200	how your friend might see it and describe it? And will people do this? They inevitably have
4438200	4444920	an insight. They realize, oh, I didn't see this. I didn't realize that. You know that what I'm saying
4444920	4453080	is true. Think about how wise you are about other people's problems. Don't you realize it, Jim?
4453080	4458920	You're doing that same self-destructive pattern in your romantic life. I can see it so clearly,
4458920	4465800	and Jim is like, I don't really see it. And you think, ha, ha, ha, but then the roles are reversed
4465800	4471720	and Jim is saying to you, hey, you're doing that thing you do with relationship to your career.
4471720	4475880	You're doing it again. Don't you see? And you go, I don't really see it. You know that.
4478360	4484520	Part of what we're going to learn in these Socratic practices is how to be Socrates
4484600	4489400	for yourself. And that's inexorably bound up with how can we be Socrates to each other?
4490760	4499080	Okay, so back first. Let's repeat. Let's review. There's so much I do not know about myself because
4499080	4508520	of all of the facts. Realize it. Don't just state it. Live it. There's so much I shall never know
4509400	4515160	about myself because of all of the fate. Realize it. Become into deep awareness. Make it real.
4517720	4521720	There's so much I refuse to see because of all of my foolishness.
4524120	4536360	Realize it. And then there is so much I'm unable to see about myself because of all of my faults.
4539480	4544360	And you're probably saying, oh, this is a real downer. Stick with it. Stay with me.
4545960	4547080	It doesn't end that way.
4550600	4552280	Then you can turn your hands outward like this.
4554920	4563000	We go through the same procedure. There is so much I don't know about the world because of all of the facts.
4563640	4570920	There is so much I shall never know about the world because of all of the fate.
4574120	4578440	There is so much I refuse to see about the world because of all of my foolishness.
4583000	4587720	There is so much I am unable to see about the world because of all of my faults.
4588280	4596840	Then relax your hands back down to your meditation. And here's now where it flips.
4598520	4603960	You did the humility. And if it was just humility, it could be humiliating,
4604840	4613320	but it's not just the humility. Now as I inhale, both inwardly and outwardly,
4613400	4619720	I experience wonder, not curiosity, where I'm trying to find missing information.
4619720	4625400	And we'll talk more about this, but wonder, where I'm able to call the world and myself
4625400	4633960	into question, but in a way that is positive, that is enriching, that is growing me.
4633960	4642280	As I inhale, I wonder into the center of my mind outward to the circumference of the world,
4642360	4652200	inhaling, wondering, and then exhaling, receiving, receiving, being open to receiving from the world
4652200	4656360	and receiving from the depths of my psyche, the depths of the world and the depths of the psyche,
4656360	4664200	receiving, inhaling, wonder, wondering inward, wondering outward.
4664600	4674440	Exhale, receiving, receiving from the depths of the psyche, receiving from the depths of the world.
4680440	4690120	Do that practice with the breath at least four times. You may want to do it longer
4690120	4697320	and get the sense of the wonder and the receptivity actually interpenetrating,
4699240	4705880	mutually affording and enriching each other, so that you have wonder filled receptivity,
4705880	4712520	wonderful, wonderful receptivity. You have a profound humility,
4713400	4723000	but a transcendent wonder. That is the humble wonder of practice.
4725160	4732200	I recommend still doing your basic meditation practice, centering and rooting,
4734040	4741640	and then do this practice, both sides of it. The humility practice and the wonder side
4743000	4747320	and that usually only takes about five to ten minutes. You can shave a little bit off
4747320	4752440	the meditation if you really want to limit yourself to staying under 25 minutes in total,
4752440	4759640	but try it. See if it goes the full length and it doesn't bother you if it takes maybe 25 minutes.
4760840	4764840	And you may be saying, John, you're going to add all these practices and I'm not going to have time
4764840	4773560	for them. I bet you do. Take out your phone. How much screen time have you put in today?
4776200	4781960	How much did it actually make you wiser? How much did it actually make you more virtuous,
4781960	4786520	connect you to yourself, to other people, to the world? How much?
4786520	4795880	I bet a significant portion of it, maybe even most of it, was wasted time.
4797960	4807560	How about fasting a little bit from your phone so that you can feed more from the fount of wisdom?
4810520	4814360	As always, thank you very much for your time and attention.
4816680	4823160	What is dialectic into the logos and how does one practice it?
4825960	4831720	The related question is, what is this logos that I've sort of been only referring to intuitively
4831720	4838040	that's so central to the logos? We're going to start with the first question
4839400	4844200	and as we answer it, it will give us what we need to answer the second question. So what is,
4844200	4850200	what is dialectic into the logos? Everything is coming down to this.
