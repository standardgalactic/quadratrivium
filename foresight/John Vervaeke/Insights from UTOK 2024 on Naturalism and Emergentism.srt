00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
Hello, everyone. The video you are about to see was originally recorded at the Utah 2024 conference.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,960
It's a conversation, a panel discussion with Greg Enriquez, Alexander Bart and Benita Roy.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,000
We get into some very deep discussions about transcendent naturalism and some convergences,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
contrasts, and criticism. I hope you enjoy the video.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,840
Alrighty, friends. First off, welcome. Good to see so many folks here.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
I'm just saying my heart tickled to have an opportunity to have this conversation

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,120
with some of my very, very dear friends who have emerged in this space.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,040
And of course, John, who will be joining us in a second, has been really tremendously influential.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,240
It's been tremendously meaningful to connect with him. And I think since 2018,

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,400
Bart and I hooked up 2019 in the Intellectual Deep Web. And I got to say there are few people

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,480
in this world who are both more entertaining and more deep and more profound than John.

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,160
Alexander Bart, his Intellectual Deep Web is inspiring, his way of being in the world,

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,880
his vision across the breadth. Tyler Groke asked at the end of the last session,

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
well, is Utah really encompassed everybody? And I was like, well, not somebody like Bart.

15
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Bart's are asked here on outside Utah, although I think they dance well together.

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,880
So Alexander Bart, thank you so much for being here. I really look forward to dialoguing.

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,200
And over the last couple of years, another dear friend of mine, Bonnie,

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,800
we have explored. I've started to learn, I'm still an amateur, but it's starting to really get a grip

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,200
on process ontology, on what true naturalism really means as opposed to the fake person that John

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,160
and I are doing. And I'm really looking forward to sharing about the layers of metaphysics

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,000
in relation. And so what we have today is then a very exciting exploration and discussion

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,760
where we're going to be talking about transcendent naturalism. John and I will be representing that.

23
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,880
Bonnie is going to bring her perspective, at least it sometimes is talked about,

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
that is fierce naturalism. I'm not sure if that's still the term that she is using. Yes.

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,560
And what that means. And then we have transcendent emergentism. And the title of our talk,

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,640
and I think me and John and Bonnie are okay with naturalism. We'll explore that. We're going to

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,520
get into what Bart feels about naturalism versus emergentism. And so we're going to be exploring

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,840
the relationships and excavating the fault lines in relationship to these two sets of perspectives.

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:09,360
And so here we are. If John's around, let me just see. Not sure if he's in yet or not in

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,840
relationship to that. I don't know. He's still not quite. Oh, there he is. Hey, John, wonderful.

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:26,320
Can you unmute yourself, friend? Can you unmute? Ask to unmute.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,680
Now I'm on mute. There he is. Okay. Woo-hoo. I think we're all here then.

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,360
All right. So John, I just gave an overview introduction. Bonnie, Bart, Johnny and me,

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,960
I need to say that once. We're going to explore. So what we thought we'd do today,

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,760
in terms of basic order, is that John's going to kick us off talking, give us an outline of

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,440
transcendent naturalism. Of course, John and I did a series on that. I thought we had a lot of

37
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,320
excellent guests. We're going to wrap that series up with Lehmann Pascal and Bruce Alderman,

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,120
who obviously will bring lovely things to summarize that. So we're going to start with that.

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,720
Then Bonnie's going to give her take, explore a metaphysics that I think overlaps some,

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,480
but also potentially critiques. And then Bart will bring his perspective. The last thing I'll

41
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,960
say is, coming off of, obviously I mentioned last time, you talk emphasized the enlightenment

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,040
gap coming off natural sizes. I look around today, you've got materialism, idealism and dualism,

43
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,360
basically in the West. I think all of us would say, no, none of those are adequate. We need a new

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,720
framework, a new philosophical framework for the 21st century and beyond, and it's time to start

45
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:53,040
laying that down. So here we are. Let's get it rolling. John, if you would, take it away. I

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,760
introduced you already, then I already told you what a brother-in-arms you are, this process,

47
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,840
and how much I admire and respect you and your leadership. And that goes really for,

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,240
certainly, Agent Bard and Benito, and I should have that already. So welcome, my friend.

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,560
Thank you, Greg. And I'm looking forward to talking with you, Benita, and with you, Alexander.

50
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,200
So, Greg asked me to give an overview of the argument. I'll try to keep it as brief as possible

51
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:28,000
without leaving it with too many major gaps. I won't go over the argument in detail. I will

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,680
often just refer to arguments that were made in detail in the previous conference presentation

53
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,960
and on the series, Transcendent Naturalism. So Transcendent Naturalism comes out of two

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,280
proposals. It comes out of the proposal of extended naturalism, plus a proposal of a kind

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
of extended naturalism that supports strong transcendence, where that transcendence is

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,160
not just psychological in nature, but has real epistemological and ontological significance.

57
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,960
And there's two main arguments here. Each one is a meta-argument, a convergent argument,

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,880
a convergent argument for a properly-leveled ontology, and then a convergence argument for

59
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,760
a conformity theory of knowing. And then the proposal is, if you have a conformity theory of

60
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,560
knowing with a leveled ontology, you can actually afford a strong transcendence. I will add to that

61
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,840
something that I didn't make in the original talk, just a brief note on why that can be properly

62
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:35,200
understood as sacred. So extended naturalism is the proposal that science, let's take what

63
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,760
naturalism is standardly understood to mean, is that the natural sciences, that is where the

64
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,320
naturalism comes, are those projects that dictate to us our fundamental ontology, our fundamental

65
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,560
structural reality. Now that is usually interpreted without much justification as all of our ontology

66
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,920
has to be derivable from the ontology of the natural sciences. And I argue that that actually

67
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:09,360
doesn't make sense. You also have to include in naturalism everything that is presupposed

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,440
in order to do science. Your ontology needs to include that, or you actually have a blind spot

69
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,120
in your ontology. And that's the new book, by the way, by Evan Thompson, by Adam Frank,

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,960
sorry, an astrophysicist, Marcelo Gleiser, a theoretical physicist, and Evan Thompson,

71
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,920
a 4E cognitive scientist, and just some shameless self-promotion. The chapter on the blind spot

72
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,680
within cognition explicitly talks about Vervecchi's theory of relevance realization as the blind spot

73
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,520
within cognition. So yay, John. Okay, so anyways, the idea here is, if you do not include the

74
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,320
standpoint from which you are doing science, then you actually have an incomplete and therefore

75
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:01,040
incoherent ontology. And what I want to argue is, what does science actually presuppose? Well,

76
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,320
it presupposes scientists doing science. And how do we work that? How do we have to extend our

77
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,480
naturalism in order to include that? I take a look at three convergence arguments. One is from

78
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:21,920
Blackowitz on what he calls the real difference. He argues that reductionism is based on the premise

79
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,840
that only what is shared between things is ultimately real, that he argues can't be right.

80
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,760
Real differences matter. Real differences are presupposed by real information. If there's no

81
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,560
real information, there's no real intelligibility. And so you need real difference, which means

82
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:49,760
you have genuine emergence. The next main argument comes from whole. And this is the idea that

83
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:59,040
communication needs redundancy. Redundancy needs levels of reality to it. And causal signaling

84
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,320
is a form of communication. And therefore you need real emergence. Again, I'm not going to go over

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,600
these arguments in a way that is intended to make them persuasively convincing. I have done that in

86
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,720
the previous talk. We did that at the intro to transcendent naturalism. I am just referring to

87
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,080
them. You can go back and I'm going to take it that you're extending me the good faith,

88
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,440
that there are persuasive arguments for each one of these claims.

89
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,520
The third argument comes from the work of Yoraro, that science needs real structure.

90
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:37,040
And she makes a distinction between bottom up causes that change actuality and top down constraints

91
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,160
that shape possibility into potentiality. And science, of course, needs top down constraints.

92
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,880
These are things like E equals mc squared, which are not events. They are real constraints,

93
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,680
real structuring principles in reality. So so far, we need a leveled reality in order to get real

94
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,120
information, in order to get real causal signaling, in order to get real structure.

95
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,800
And then we have Smith's vertical causation argument, Volcker and Smith, which is the

96
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,200
argument to the effect that the measuring device cannot be at the same ontological level as what

97
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,480
is measured, especially when we come down to quantum entities. And so you need a real leveled

98
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,640
ontology in order for measurement. So notice what science presupposes real information,

99
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,120
real causal signaling, real structural principles. And it presupposes real measurement,

100
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,400
integrating all of those together, all of those presuppose a leveled ontology.

101
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,840
Vervecky makes a similar convergent argument that I made at Ralston at length,

102
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,880
which is in order for us to do science, we have to include the scientist on our ontology.

103
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,680
And that converges with everything I've just said. Why is it not just emergence up? The

104
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,400
problem with just emergence up, and this is not just my idea. Many people have talked about this,

105
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,000
is it gives you the level, the emergent level is epiphenomenal. It has no causal powers in its

106
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,120
own right, or no constraining powers in its own right. The problem with epiphenomenalism,

107
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,520
it's an oxymoronic term. It is a category for which we can find no non controversial members.

108
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,800
And it presuppose, it indicates that something exists, but does not make any difference in

109
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,360
reality and therefore is not knowable. I'm not going to go into that argument at length. I think

110
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,080
if your, if your ontology leads to epiphenomenalism, it is a modus tolens. You have led to a reductio

111
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,880
adipocertum. So you have to have real emanation and real emergence completely interpenetrating

112
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,840
each other. You have a continuum. And when we talk about levels, all we're doing is picking out

113
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,040
things that are particularly explanatorily, causally relevant. Whole has a formal proof

114
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,800
that each level has a distinct set of causal powers to it. And therefore, when we're talking

115
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,440
about levels, we're just picking out something that is most causally relevant to the particular

116
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,840
kind of explanation. But that is not that it is just an epistemic convenience. The levels are

117
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,960
epistemic conveniences that refer to a real emanation, emanation emergence continuum.

118
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:26,320
Now, what about the meta argument towards a conformity theory? So the opposite to conformity

119
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,000
theory is our current modern theory that knowledge is a matter of representation. I have something

120
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,640
in my head that represents the world. Pickstock in her astonishing book, Aspects of Truth and

121
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,720
New Religious Metaphysics from 2020 reviews all of the distinction arguments that are supposed

122
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,880
to support the proposal of representational knowledge and shows that within analytic philosophy,

123
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,920
itself, they have all been seriously undermined. The analytic synthetic distinction, of course,

124
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,480
has been undermined by Quine, the distinction between a conceptual scheme and its content,

125
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,520
by Davidson, the fact value distinction, and the is-ought distinction by Putnam,

126
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,280
Case Beer, or Verveke has one that relevance is both a cause and a reason. And the theory data

127
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,120
distinction by Quine and Duhem. So all of the distinctions that were supposed to

128
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,440
open up the space between mind and world for which representation with the bridge was the

129
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,240
bridge have been completely undermined. And what that returns you to is a conformity theory

130
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,560
that the mind and reality are co-participating in shared principles of individuation,

131
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:43,600
identification, intelligibility, and they're often mutually shaping each other

132
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,480
all the way from these construction up to cultural world views.

133
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,080
I also made an argument that cognition is all the cognitive sciences are converging on the idea

134
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,040
that cognition is a dynamic continuum of emergence up and top down, bottom up, top down,

135
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:12,400
completely into penetrating dynamically, realized processing. And if that was not tracking the

136
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,600
grammar of reality, if that grammar of cognition was not tracking the grammar of reality, we would

137
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,280
be facing a radical skepticism, a radical solipsism, because it would be that the mind in principle

138
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,520
could not know reality, and we'd be into very deep Kantian problems, and I won't reveal all the sort

139
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,880
of tensions and contradictions within the Kantian proposal. So we get a conformity theory.

140
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,320
And then that links up with independent arguments within 4e Cogsai, launched by Gibson about the

141
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,120
importance of affordances for perception and action and knowledge, Heidegger and the

142
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,760
all aesthetic notion of truth that is deeper than the coherence or correspondence notion of truth,

143
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,320
and Vervecchi's proposal that relevance realization is inherently transjective

144
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,560
and binds the subjective to the objective together and is therefore more real. And all of these

145
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,120
converge on a conformity theory of knowing. Now if you have a real leveled ontology and a conformity

146
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,720
theory of knowing by knowing it, I know I'm not only engaging in psychological improvement,

147
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:22,240
I'm actually knowing levels of reality that are otherwise inaccessible. And I am changing ontologically

148
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,480
to different levels of the self that correspond through participation. Actually, I want to

149
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,040
erase that sentence, levels of the self that participate with levels of reality.

150
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,400
And so that is strong transcendence. It is making a fundamental epistemological and ontological

151
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:47,760
difference, not just psychological hygiene and improvement. I would add to that the current

152
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,600
work integrating the work of filler, who argues that pure relationality has to be ultimate because

153
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,320
you can't get relations from Aristotelian substances. Of course, our science has pure

154
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
relationality at the bottom and at the top and scientists are seeking the relation

155
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,440
between the cosmological and the quantum. Nishita's argument that Aristotle's substance

156
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,160
metaphysics, a substance is not stuff. A substance are independently existing objects, things.

157
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,440
Aristotle's ontology, which we still fundamentally share, is that things are ultimately real and

158
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,200
that relations and processes emerge from it. And that is tracked by a subject predicate logic.

159
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,880
Nishita shows, you get Filler's argument that that doesn't work. Relationality is deeper than

160
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,880
subject and predicate and deeper than substance and its properties. Nishita shows the Aristotelian

161
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,720
metaphysics is inherently contradictory because it depends on predication, which is of universals,

162
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,760
but its ontology claims that individual substances, individual things are most real.

163
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,600
And this is the problem of how can the universals ever know the particular? It bedevils

164
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,200
medieval philosophy until the Aristotelian framework collapses and you get nominalism,

165
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,680
the proposed and what they do, what they decide to do is keep the substance ontology,

166
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,200
individual things ultimately exist, but there are no real relations, no real patterns. They exist

167
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,760
only in the mind. That's nominalism. That of course gives you a dualism because the mind is a

168
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,320
fundamentally different kind of reality than reality. And then dualism gives you all the

169
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,280
disasters of the meaning crisis. These are all arguments for abandoning a substance ontology

170
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,880
and understanding that a no-thingness of pure relationality is what is ultimately real.

171
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,800
Finally, making use of the work of the atheist Canadian philosopher Schellingberg

172
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,760
about what do we mean by the sacred? He talks about the Tripoli transcendent and this lines up

173
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,120
now with transcendent naturalism. The sacred is that which is ontologically ultimate. And of

174
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,480
course, we can conform to and participate in the ultimacy of pure relationality. Neoplatonism and

175
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,880
Zen both talk about this. Sodorological, it can transform you by entering into this relationship.

176
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,480
Of course, you get fundamental transformation of human beings because you're engaging in strong

177
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,040
transcendence. It saves you, it liberates you, it frees you in epistemologically and ontologically

178
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,040
significant ways, not just psychologically. And it's axiological. It gives you a reciprocal

179
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,560
opening relationship as you get the ground of the self is opening up to the ground of reality.

180
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:38,400
And they are ultimately non logically identical because they are co-realizations,

181
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,160
co-participations in the dynamic realization of pure relationality. And that that reciprocal

182
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:54,560
opening gives you a capacity to fall in love and to involve the whole of the self without

183
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:01,280
in any way being self involved. And this is would be a touchstone for all other normative

184
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,200
evaluations. So it would be it would be axiologically transcendent. I can develop all

185
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,440
of those arguments in greater detail if needed. So transcendent naturalism puts us into a

186
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,080
participatory relationship with ontological ultimacy, sodorological ultimacy, axiological

187
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,640
ultimacy. And that means it is also sacred. So transcendent naturalism gives an account

188
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,120
of sacredness and ultimate reality that is nevertheless still consistent with naturalism.

189
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,320
But that naturalism has to be extended naturalism. That's the gist of the arguments and some

190
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
recent additions I have made to them. So thank you very much, everyone, for your time and attention.

191
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,360
Wonderful. Thank you so much. And so I think that's a brilliant and crisp summary of the core

192
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,800
tenets. Christian put it in the group and I mentioned that John and I have done the series.

193
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,760
It brings in a number of different thinkers. I'm not going to get into it now because I did a

194
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,800
review of you talk and certainly have raised some questions. But let's just say what John just laid

195
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,120
out is a ball from Roy Bashkar and say there's a philosophical under laboring, a richness,

196
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,920
and of course then extending into modern cognitive science that fits sort of with

197
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,960
you talk and sort of a lock and key. I am not a philosopher by training in relation. I got some

198
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,840
notions, but the ways in which you talk is structured as we've dialogued is fundamentally

199
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,760
consistent and I think affords certain kinds of elaborations on what John was talking about.

200
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,440
But I'm not going to get into that because we're really talking fundamentally about these different

201
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,960
positions. What I want to do now is turn the discussion over to Benita Roy so that she can

202
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,200
share her perspective on naturalism, what John offers, and what she brings to bear in relation.

203
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Benita Roy, can you, you can unmute. There you go.

204
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
Woman's worst nightmare.

205
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,640
First I want to thank John and Greg and all their guests because I've watched many,

206
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:23,040
many hours of their transcendent naturalism series and I really like season two. I think

207
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,960
it was, you know, you designed it so there's a lot of shake ups and different ideas and stuff

208
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,400
coming in and I think you brought in the problem and showed that there's a real critical importance

209
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:44,720
to this, but also that it's not easy. I don't think any of us think it's easy. So I'm glad that

210
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:53,840
John ended with Axiology because for me, why does this all matter? I think where the rubber hits

211
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:02,880
the road is that if we could come up with a system that is transcendent naturalism that really helps

212
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,680
people close the gap between the is and the ought, I think that this would be its biggest

213
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,640
contribution as we struggle with science and the psyche and idealism and reductionism and stuff.

214
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,520
This is kind of like the path toward that, but I really think that the goal,

215
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
one of the huge goals would be the axiological goal.

216
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,000
I want to start with a quote and the quote is to remind us, I think we all can agree with this

217
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,360
quote, but we're here on line and we're going to do a lot of talking and use a lot of words,

218
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,720
but I just want to honor the fact that for me and I assume for you that this is a constraint

219
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,520
and that we're after something that's really personal and sacred to us and meaningful to us

220
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,840
personally at a deep level. And so the quotes from Warren Heidi and he writes,

221
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,560
how should one live? Not by painstakingly constructing a linguistic replica of a corner

222
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,720
of the cosmos and then running repeatable experiments and quantifying the results,

223
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,080
but by carefully reflecting on what we are and what living well means for us.

224
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,840
So I think the journey often looks like constructing a linguistic replica of the

225
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,520
corner of the cosmos. I think those are the tools that we use, but I just want to remind

226
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,400
us that I recognize in all of us that that certainly is not our goal.

227
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,400
I don't really have a model or a system or an argument to make. I want to introduce some tools

228
00:23:48,400 --> 00:24:00,480
that I think are useful in this project. And one tool is metaphysics. And my definition of

229
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,160
metaphysics amongst many others is I think that the purpose of metaphysics is to distinguish

230
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:19,200
the true from the real. Now, we have to define those very precisely and there's many different

231
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,840
ways to define them. But the way I am meaning about that is kind of like what Baskar talked about,

232
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:35,600
science deals with the actual and not the real. And so for me, the true is what science can get at.

233
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:45,200
And I define science as the set of protocols that lead to actions, the set of protocols

234
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,000
that lead to outcomes predicted by theory. And so science is in a box, a methodological box,

235
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
it has a lot of constraints, and it can create true theories. But this is quite different from the

236
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,280
real. And I'll talk a little bit about more about that later. But I think that and these are words

237
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,440
you hear, you know, John, John is talking about real, the transcendent as dealing in the realm of

238
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,680
the real and not the realm of the actual as Baskar would say, or their or the true. So I think

239
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:30,400
that's an important tool to look at. I want to talk about stratified reality. And stratified

240
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,480
reality is what we do when we say there's information energy and matter and then mind and then mind to

241
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,480
and life and this and that. There's, you know, you go different cultures and different periods of human

242
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:51,600
history, and people would not have organized the ontological stack that way. And so I was

243
00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:01,760
thinking this morning about where in our evolutionary history, pre human, did we still, we first

244
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:10,240
encounter this ability to create ontological stacks. I mean, chimpanzees aren't running around

245
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,160
creating ontological stacks, people are. But because I think I believe in the continuity

246
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:23,120
of the animal mind with the human mind, I'm thinking this morning, where, where can I find

247
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,240
the earliest template or the feeling sense of this kind of activity. And I thought about how

248
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:38,160
animals will reduce a complex puzzle into parts. They do this. And, and so these are different

249
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,640
steps of action. So I want you to think about what, you know, this is what John said,

250
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,680
what is the standpoint from which we are doing this? What is the standpoint from which we are

251
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:56,000
creating stratified reality? And so I want you to feel into this sense that, okay, it starts in our

252
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,400
pre evolutionary history and our animal nature of reducing, reducing is not the right word because

253
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,880
reduces like a bad word or, or separating or distinguishing or discerning a complex puzzle

254
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,960
into parts. As far as I can see, that's the first instant. And then this is what's fascinating.

255
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:22,800
This carries on with early man into toolmaking. And the fact that we can teach toolmaking through

256
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,280
a series of steps, and there's a series of parts. And then this starts this whole

257
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:36,720
evolutionary advantage, I think is what we are doing when we're, we're, is where it all started.

258
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,120
And then now I want to reflect on something and that is breaking into parts has always been a

259
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:50,720
protocol for problem solving and making. But only recently has it become a protocol for getting at

260
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:58,400
what is real, meaningful, or for moral choice. Now, I don't know what to make of that statement

261
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,560
because that was my insight this morning, driven by, you know, the, the energy of the

262
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:14,400
participation of this panel. But it's something to, it's something to think about. And maybe that's

263
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,480
a good thing because maybe we are this, we're doing a problem solving thing. But maybe, maybe

264
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,800
there's something that needs to be converted there. Okay. However, given that, I'm going to talk about

265
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,800
what people do when they do stratified reality. And there's something very interesting. There's

266
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:48,880
there's a tendency to make a mistake. And that is, if we say, let me just give you an example. So

267
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
if I say, what is pizza made of? Okay, and you can say, well, pizza is made of dough. And then I

268
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,480
say, what is dough made of? I mean, you say dough is made of wheat. This presents a simplistic and

269
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:12,560
reductive sense of what is going on. Because the pizza is made of dough, but all but made with

270
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,560
the people who, you know, proof the dough, the cook who's doing it and the oven that's cooking it

271
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:26,720
and the oven, and blah, blah, blah, all of this, the with the with is lost. The with are all these

272
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:36,000
verbs that don't survive the analysis. Okay, then we can say, well, what is dough made with dough made

273
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,760
is with made with wheat and the agricultural revolution, which is made with human evolution,

274
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,040
which is made made with the genealogy of the earth. And so one of the things that happens when we

275
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,360
ontological stack along categories is all the with is gone. And all and it's kind of like the

276
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,600
physicists that when they say, well, 97% of matter and energy, we can't get our hands on.

277
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,680
And so there's something about this enterprise of categorization, stratifying reality that loses

278
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:17,360
all the with. So that's the first thing I want to point out. And I only want to point out really

279
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:26,560
one other thing. And that is, if you notice, as you go down, here's pizza.

280
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,160
Here's dough. Here's pizza and a whole bunch of cooks and stuff in the and the fact that you

281
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:41,040
bought the flour. Okay. And then here's dough and dough is made with wheat. As I go down,

282
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:50,640
the systems that are left out become larger, not smaller. So Sabina Hobson Felder has this

283
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,000
strong critique against physics and so does Eric Weinstein. And it's part of it is this problem.

284
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,720
Because if by the time you get to matter, and then you get to sub atoms, and then you get to

285
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:12,000
subatomic particles, the Higgs boson is made with the whole scientific enterprise across all of human

286
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,440
history, and the politicians and the money. And she's recent Hassan Felder's recently come out

287
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,960
and said, there's a real problem with the scientific enterprise. And this problematizes

288
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,000
something like the Higgs boson. And so this sense that the lower you go down, the more is actually

289
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,920
has to be included to justify the simple thing you are saying exists in this category of reality.

290
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:53,440
So I just want to add those. I haven't put it together. And I'm hoping that bar is up for the

291
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,480
challenge. Thank you very much for your time. All right. Thank you so much, Benita. I took some notes.

292
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,120
So what we're going to do, certainly after I'm going to hand it over to Bart, he's going to offer

293
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,000
one thing I will say. I hope for our conversation is naturalism, emergentism,

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,040
contrast, maybe Barbara will bring that. I found a lot I resonated with and what Benita said,

295
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,480
some questions that I had. I look forward to jumping in those. But we're going to hand it off

296
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,600
to Alexander Bart and let us have it, Bart. I'm kind of shocked at how much we agree.

297
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:34,000
But I knew we would probably. But I think there's there's also a lot here in the nuance. And Benita

298
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and I, I'm going to do the sales pitch right away. It's done because it's fucking working.

299
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,840
It's not profit, by the way, it's pros and it came out last year. And I realized I had to do

300
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,600
metaphysics when I wrote this six book of mine. I had to do it. I had to sit down and do metaphysics

301
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,120
because the way we did human history could not be explained unless we had, you know, an understanding

302
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
of how we do universal history. So I had to go down to the dirty work of actually going into

303
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,440
metaphysics for the book. Bonita and I had wonderful conversations this fall already. I really

304
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,440
look forward to continue those. So I'm here with Bonita against John and Greg's. You know,

305
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,400
it's Abba again. I'm Swedish. It's like Bjorn and Benny against Anne and Fred Magnetta. But it's like,

306
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,760
but we had wonderful conversations. She gets the book and I really appreciate Bonita. She gets the

307
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,400
book in the sense that I'm the son of Hegel and she's the daughter of Whitehead. You know,

308
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,760
and I've always found Hegel and Whitehead to be scaringly compatible with each other. Hegel being

309
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,520
still not understood in the Anglo-Saxon world, basically, because we were all blinded by the

310
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,080
enormous turn with the amount of account to the content turn it's called in contemporary philosophy.

311
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
But what happened was that only a few years later in Germany, there was another shock, at least

312
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,080
on our part with the content turn, which is the Hegelian turn. So I will return to Hegel and bring

313
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,800
that into the conversation because a lot of what John is asking for. And I totally agree.

314
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,920
We have to do this turn and get out of the metal crisis. But actually, the work was done

315
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,520
by Hegel and Nietzsche in the 19th century. It's precisely by reading Hegel and Nietzsche through

316
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,400
each other. I worked on this for 30 years. I think we can see that there was a turn here. There was

317
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,400
a turn away from dualism. The last dualism was, of course, a modern kind onto a modest worldview

318
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,320
where the obsession is with difference. Okay. So everything relates to everything else in the

319
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,440
universe. And I totally agree with John. Epiphenomalism is just the dead end because, obviously,

320
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,160
my thinking relates my physicality to it. It's just all the different things that

321
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:35,120
exist affect everything else. So what we did in the book, there were two things. One of them is that

322
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,440
we realized that three of the philosophical disciplines that I'm a philosopher, I'm not a

323
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,160
scientist. When I'm a scientist, I'm an economist, which I will totally leave out of this conversation.

324
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,960
The economist Alexander Barj, you don't get seen today. But I'm a philosopher and an artist. So

325
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,080
allow me to be, if possible, maybe we might need to hear even more of the philosopher. And then

326
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,680
Greg and John, who are fantastic scientists, can stay with the size. But my pointer is that we needed

327
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,640
to look at the philosophical disciplines themselves. So being tired of doing ontology, because I'll

328
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,640
actually find ontology to be quite easy. There's ontology and there's ontics. Essentially, that's

329
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,720
what happened after Kant. So then everything starts moving and everything is relational,

330
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,520
and that's Hegel. From Hegel, through Nietzsche, on to White Ted, and on to the last, we have

331
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,680
realized that everything is relational fundamentally. All this very difficult to think

332
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,360
relationalism, it's absolutely necessary. The object out there is a byproduct of the relation.

333
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,440
There are a lot that comes after the relation. So I think we all agree on that. But Hegel did

334
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,520
too. The thing is with Hegel, he stopped in his dialectical method. He just said that no,

335
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:42,320
there is no fixed point anywhere in the universe ever. There are no, there's no individual. I

336
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,440
am many different people. I was a different person yesterday than I am tomorrow. By the way,

337
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,680
I die all the time and I'm born all the time. Divigiality is the normal state of things for us

338
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,080
to be human. So this was already Hegel because with his dialectical method, there is no fixed

339
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,440
point. You must imagine that you live in the universe where you're not allowed to have fixed

340
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,120
point unless you know you're only having a fixed point to use it to then try to understand something.

341
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,600
So it's like you borrow into that fixed point and that's called negation in Hegel. So what we did

342
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,240
was that we took ontology, epistemology and phenomenology and threw them all into one big

343
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,320
big mess, which is what Hegel actually did. What he said was basically that ontology and

344
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,000
epistemology and phenomenology are in themselves all three, three relational siblings in the world

345
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
of philosophy. And he started doing ontology and epistemology at the same time, which is how

346
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
we overcame Kant because in Kant, they were separate. And suddenly with Hegel, it's just

347
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,640
like he cracks jokes at Kant all the time. He's just like, no, no, no, Kant. It's not like there's

348
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,120
a phenomenon there and there's a numinal there because actually you are engaged and involved

349
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,480
with the numinal. So we call it phenomenology, just to crack a joke about it. Hegel constructed

350
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,400
phenomenology. So the thing was that by doing this and calling it narratology, I think we

351
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,400
come down to something that we can agree on is basically very human. Because in Hegel,

352
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,320
there's a subject and there's a substance. And it's a sub-relationship to the substance,

353
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,800
which is what philosophy is all about. There's always human subjectivity constantly returning

354
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,480
in Hegel. And whenever you try to come up with anything without you being involved with the

355
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,880
world, Hegel says, no way. That's cheating. Back to you again, because you are involved as philosopher

356
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,600
or as partner of the philosopher or as you believe you are involved in the world and we are humans.

357
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,280
Philosophy is a human endeavor. So narratology enabled us to say that this is the trick with

358
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,440
dialectics. Always have a three. So if you want to spice up your sex life, bring a third person

359
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,280
into the bedroom. I highly recommend it. This is very Hegel. What Hegel does is that no, dialectics

360
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,200
is not the dichotomy in opposition between two points. Like if you are young, you must split

361
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,920
either the young or the young. And Taoists actually do that, Bonito probably agrees, by splitting on

362
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,600
the young side. Always take the masculine side to make the split there because men are so fucking

363
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,680
scared to get away, women are not. So you split on the side and say there's young and the young

364
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,400
within the young. And then the young is opposite the young. This is how Hegel works all the time.

365
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,640
So by using ontology and epistemology and phenomenology as three philosophical discourses

366
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,000
and then saying they're all three interconnected one another. And this is the Hegelian absolute.

367
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,800
The Hegelian absolute is to recognize that and to recognize there is no fixed point

368
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,920
and using vocabulary from the Greeks, we then say that there's a logos and there's a pathos and

369
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,440
there's a mythos. Human beings have three different ways of describing reality or describing the world

370
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,440
that makes sense of the world. They use a logos, use a mythos and use the pathos. And science,

371
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,400
of course, is on the side of logos fundamentally. Pathos is just our emotional lives, our feelings

372
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,560
and blah, blah, blah. There's no such thing in AI, by the way, electricity is not blood.

373
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,240
Put it that way. The pathos is incredibly human, animalistic, whatever, you know,

374
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,320
all the forces inside of you, the force of nature, pathic, pathical narratives,

375
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,440
you know, news, a cast, pornography, anything that's brutally real thrown at you is a pathical

376
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,480
narrative. And then there's mythos and mythos is actually as often Hegel to go between,

377
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,280
meaning that since logos and pathos can never be unified in themselves as logos or pathos,

378
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:19,120
you have to invent a mythos. And this is the temporary story about ourselves that human beings

379
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,120
have to create all the time to make sense of the world. So Hegel allows us to have a temporary

380
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,000
platform, which we agree, at least now we can agree, we have a paradigm, we have a certain

381
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,040
historical period, we agree on certain values, we create a society together and off we go, right?

382
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,600
So to create that temporary platform, the mythos about ourselves currently in the digital age

383
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,400
with AI arriving and climate change and everything to arrive at a mythos is what we need. The meta

384
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,520
crisis is a lack of a new mythos. It's a nihilistic state where the old mythos is dead.

385
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,560
It's it's not a death of a God, it's a death of a paradigm and a new paradigm has to be

386
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,160
stored and we're in between paradigms for the most. Okay, so this moves us on to metaphysics.

387
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,200
So what kind of what kind of implications does this neurological model have for metaphysics?

388
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:12,000
What it means that like you guys, the three of you here, I hate reductionism, reductionism,

389
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,280
most silliest thing ever. Bonita just pointed out perfectly so simply by reducing the pizza to

390
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,400
the wheat is idiocy, right? The problem is that I don't know why, but especially the computer

391
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,880
scientists to make all the technology they are all reductionist and they tend to go to either

392
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,600
reduction down to the so sort of simplest monad which where apparently the entire history of

393
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,000
the universe is preprogrammed or something. They go all the way down to reduce everything down to

394
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,680
some kind of atom, which would then explain everything else that happens afterwards because

395
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,800
everything is then deterministic from that point, which I totally disagree with. But they also go

396
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
the other way and said, well, I'm conscious and there's consciousness is in some center of the

397
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,560
universe. And I'm a fucking narcissist. And because I'm a computer scientist, just made

398
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,680
billions of dollars. Therefore, everything has to be about me. So everything can be reduced

399
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,640
to a consciousness. All I tell those guys is that here is a rock, go and cuddle with a rock,

400
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,920
have sex with the rock and talk to the rock, not with me apparently because the rock has

401
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,520
consciousness and you can talk to it, right? And off they go. So reductionism is the enemy,

402
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,080
but it's being this difficult to get rid of reductionism. I know all you guys here in the

403
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,560
thread say, oh, relations, yes, of course, relations prior to a lot of our own relations,

404
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,360
you have no idea of difficulties to actually sit down and try to do relationalist philosophy.

405
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,640
This is why two geniuses like Hegel and Nietzsche and White Ted to do it. And it's really,

406
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,280
really hard. But okay, but if you try to do it, you got to remove all those things out there

407
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,960
where you lose track. So what I'm proposing is that I'm sorry, but the word nature is just

408
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,480
the opposite of culture. And I'm defiant here. Nature is not superior to culture.

409
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:55,040
The just different emerges as nature emerged and culture emerged. And like Greg probably

410
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,680
graced me, they're equal. If you're going to do metaphysics, don't do don't do axiology,

411
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,520
we do metaphysics, leave axiology, you can do that later. It can be its own fourth story,

412
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,280
whatever, leave axiology, just try to be as neutral as you can, try to describe how the

413
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
world functions. That's all you try to do here philosophically. That's metaphysics. So you say,

414
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,880
okay, so where do I start them? Well, here's the great thing, Bergson. Bergson said, why is everybody

415
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,360
obsessed with why there's something rather nothing? Because that's just interchangeable,

416
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,720
like you were nothing, then you were born, you were something and then you die, you're nothing

417
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,120
again. There's something and nothing all the time. That wasn't even a philosophical question,

418
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,440
this like betrugation. And then Bergson said, what really strikes me with reality and with

419
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,720
the university is how much difference there is. God, there's so much difference and difference

420
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,240
and difference upon difference and difference between differences and differences and differences

421
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,320
all the time, which is relations. Relationship is obsession with difference. And I'm obsessed with it.

422
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,400
So I start my philosophy right here and now with you guys. And then I said, what philosophy is

423
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,440
concerned with, what metaphysics is concerned with is that shit happens. And then the question is,

424
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,960
what is shit? What kinds of shit are there? And what does it mean that something happens?

425
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,360
Okay, then there's a great word for that, which is emergence. And we can then locate

426
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,840
emergence as we temporarily say, emergence is like the most important happening that ever happened

427
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:24,560
to us. So we sit here and describe the world of the 21st century. What is the most important thing

428
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,480
that ever happened to us? And this is where Greg got some of the ideas from and Greg and I started

429
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,400
into changing, you know, knowledge with each other a few years ago, is that it makes sense

430
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,400
then to create these different emerges that have happened. Well, apparently, some kind of big

431
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,000
bounce or big bang, whatever happened. And physics came out of that. And we have chemistry and we

432
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,040
have biology. And biology and physics is a hard problem to begin with. You don't need to mind

433
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,360
a matter to have a hard problem. The hard problem is everywhere. Because if one thing is irreducible

434
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,120
to something else, probably the problem is hard just because you're using the wrong language.

435
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,800
If you use the language of biology, try to describe physics, you're going to go dead wrong.

436
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,320
If you use the language of physics, try to describe biology, it won't work. So biology is

437
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,480
just a different emergence vector compared to physics and different emerges vector. I even

438
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,960
allow chemistry one as well. And then we would always say mind. And as Greg says, the mind has

439
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,840
produced culture and culture is radically different from all the natures we had in the past. So we

440
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,320
have a cultural emergence vector. So when we look at the world, we have these different

441
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:27,120
emergence vectors. And then we could start make sense of each one of them independently by refusing

442
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,880
to reduce any one of them to the other ones. Can you see how flat this becomes? So it's an

443
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,640
emergentism to begin with. So this emergentism. Now here's the problem though. Something could

444
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,600
happen. You know, shit happens. Something could happen that forces us to rethink how we look at

445
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:49,120
the world. It's happened in the past quite a few times. It seems even like every time a new paradigm

446
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,040
comes right now, the internet came and took over the world. And we had satellites everywhere,

447
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,240
we're all interconnected with each other and AI comes along. And of course we start seeing

448
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,880
networks everywhere. And then we live in a network dynamical world all of a sudden. And then of

449
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,760
course we say, well, everything is religious. Yeah, because to us now here, network dynamical

450
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,200
universe to make sense of this, for me sitting here is waiting talking to you guys like we're

451
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,040
in the same room. Magic. Yesterday's magic is tomorrow's technology. Magic. Okay. So the world

452
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,160
changes. And our world, you have to change with it. And we're only human. That means the emergentism

453
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:28,480
has to be transcendental. And here's the trick. It is so, so easy by human mind, which is stuck

454
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,360
with reductionism to try to find rules and patterns for emergencies. Say that, well,

455
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,320
an emergency is objectively when this thing's happened that it's an emergency. And then Hegel

456
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:45,520
and I just said, no way, no way, baby, you can't do that. Because if an emergency occurs, it wasn't

457
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:53,520
pre-programmed. There was no creator God that dictated beforehand what constitutes an emergency.

458
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,080
It's like Hegel says, it's only in his side that we human beings construct the necessity of the past

459
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:07,360
and say that because now with what we know now, that was an emergency, but that was not. Okay.

460
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:13,920
That means the number one rule for transcendental emergentism is that it disqualifies any general

461
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,640
emergency theory. There's no general concept to what an emergency is beforehand. What happens is

462
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,880
that when a certain emergence happens, the entire theory has to be thrown out and reconstructed as

463
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,480
a new transcendental emergent system. And that is the transcendentality. It's allowing us to

464
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,800
completely change everything. Or like I say, when people say they don't believe in God, well,

465
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,680
haven't waited long enough yet, meaning God could come. Looking at AIs, getting scared like God,

466
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,800
and we might need God because we haven't mentored the devil. We did August 6, 1945, we blow up a

467
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,600
bomb over Oshima, the devil very much exists, and we went to the devil. So we have to do theology

468
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,560
again and understand we didn't ment the devil. Where is God to save us from the devil? Right?

469
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,880
Now, if you do that, if you start to think about the word like that, there's incredible freedom

470
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,960
in going for a transcendental emergency perspective. And why I use the word emergency rather than nature

471
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,160
is because it's a purely metaphysical theory. Greg and John are doing science metaphysics

472
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,240
for science. I respect that. But if you do a purely metaphysical theory, it's better to work

473
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,440
with the emergency because it's absolutely neutral. It just says that shit happens.

474
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:29,600
It says nothing else. It doesn't say nature. It doesn't say culture. And it says that if an

475
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,640
emergency happens, and we in hindsight, we live in the 21st century will agree on that these things

476
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,560
are the most important things that ever happen in history. And then we can start looking at these

477
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,600
are the most important things that ever happen in human history, because in the same last

478
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,520
historical season, these dramatic events to change history forever, and we know how to live

479
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,800
with the consequence of that. Hiroshima being one of them. Okay, that's an emergency. Transcendent

480
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,560
emergentism applied on human history, and then we can start understanding society.

481
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,640
So that's essentially how you do metaphysics. If you're a little philosopher like me, I guess.

482
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:07,680
All right. Thank you. Each of you. I think we've gotten a very good summary of the various

483
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,960
perspectives. I'll just put a let me let me put a little Utah spin. Then I'll invite John

484
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,640
Benita and Bart to just talk amongst themselves. Certainly if I have there are a lot I want to

485
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,720
say, but I really want the three of you guys to have some dialogue. I want to remind folks,

486
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:34,080
since we're here in Utah land for the conference, that Utah is situated in a particular kind of

487
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,520
problem. And that is what I mentioned earlier in terms of like Bart is coming from a different place.

488
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,000
It is very important to understand the situation of Utah. And that's crucial to understand both

489
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,880
its power and its limitations. It is structured to solve or it emerges out of a very particular

490
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,640
kind of justificatory problem, which presupposes the natural sciences and the kind of knowledge

491
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,440
they're trying to generate. And how does it then relate to psychology as both the science and the

492
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,800
subject? And the Utah architecture is concerned with that and it emerges as a naturalism as a

493
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,720
function of that. That does not necessarily say that, oh, that is where everyone should be situated

494
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,200
or a philosopher that takes a pure proper metaphysical stance should be situated there.

495
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,320
So I'll just say that in relationship to the Utah stance. So I can hang with Bart and basically be

496
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,560
like, oh, there's a different framing that we should be aware of. And if we have those framings,

497
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,400
I think there's a lot of participatory dance that can be effectively take place.

498
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,960
So I'll offer that. And it's a very similar comment in relationship to Benita. And really,

499
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,760
actually, then there's the synergy with John's view in particular. And I think that is a function

500
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,800
of being psychologists, cognitive science, et cetera. So I'll offer that sort of as a synergistic,

501
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,120
but I also want to get into some disagreements. I have some questions for both Bonnie and Bart,

502
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,400
but I'm going to pause. I'm going to hand it back to John and see where you want to take it,

503
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,400
John. And then we can just go in some dialogue amongst the four of us and then start really

504
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:14,960
bringing in some questions. Yeah, John, go ahead. I think, yeah. Okay. Yeah, thank you.

505
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,320
First of all, that was really rich and wonderful. I really welcome Alexander's. Everybody seems to

506
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:30,080
be calling him Bard. Is that what you want? It's okay. Sometimes sub-Bard, but then it will.

507
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:36,000
It makes me feel in high school. Teenage boys often use last names as opposed to first names,

508
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,320
so at least in Canada. I don't know why we do that. First of all, I'm very happy to get into

509
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,680
a discussion with Hegel. I've been doing, as you probably know, Bart, there's a renaissance about

510
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:55,600
Hegel going on, and the work of Brandum, the work of Pinkard, the work of Farnath,

511
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,920
Zambroga, all these people. I'm going through all of that literature. I'm going through it very

512
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,960
carefully with Dan Ciappi, especially Hegel's binding of the notion of rationality into

513
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,280
reciprocal recognition between individuals, not only synchronically, but intergenerationally.

514
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,120
I think that maps, by the way, very powerfully into current work on extended cognition,

515
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,920
collective intelligence, things like that. You always need to ask, where's the agent that's

516
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,360
doing the cognition? I think Hegel gives us an alternative agency. He famously talks about

517
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:37,200
the I that is we that is I, and that's the kind of agency that is doing this more fundamental

518
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,120
ontology. I think in that sense, I'm in fundamental agreement with you, and then trying to work out

519
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,720
how does that agency operate? I won't get into the details about that. I think that is a very

520
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,040
significant problem. It's a problem that is now becoming central to Foricog Psi. Hegel is coming

521
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:03,280
in in a very big way. I think in that sense, we're in agreement. I'll speak about Whitehead

522
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:11,440
in a second, and then I'll return to Benita. I do have an issue with Hegel, and I think this

523
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,440
comes out very clearly in Pinkard. Hegel talks a lot about the sociocultural, cultural, historical

524
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:24,400
processes that make the kind of persons, the kind of agents. We need all of these practices,

525
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,640
as he repeatedly says, that makes us into the kind of cognitive agents that can recognize

526
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,440
the inconsistencies within a particular way of life, a particular form of life. And of course,

527
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,560
the phenomenology tries to trace both that out. The problem I have is I fear that at times Hegel

528
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:50,800
verges on a performative contradiction. He is using the propositional to try to point to the

529
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,120
non-propositional. He doesn't really give us a theory of practices or an ecology of practice,

530
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,720
and that can't be just propositional. You, of course, have to use language, but you have to

531
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,200
actually engage people non-propositionally. That is the way in which they learn practices.

532
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,960
And I would put to Benita, I think she's right. We don't ultimately get at reality through

533
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,600
truth statements. We get at reality through processes, practices of realization. And that's

534
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:27,040
where I would bring in what Benita is talking about. I totally agree. We need ecologies of

535
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:35,040
practices because realization is how we get conformed to reality as distinct from truth.

536
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:43,520
And then the issue then comes up. Okay, well, what does that look like? And I think this takes us

537
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,920
into some work that's going on now about some of the work I'm doing about the deep at the heart of

538
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:53,760
the rational. And I think this is already presaged in Hegel. You find ritual. You find rituals of

539
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:59,680
recognition and forgiveness. And you find the generation of the spirit of trust. Barnett does

540
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,040
that very well. And you have additional arguments for why at the heart of the rational, we find

541
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,440
ritual, we have to use all these imaginal things. Look, simple one example of many. To be rational,

542
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,640
I have to reflect on my own cognition. Oh, well, where do I do? Well, I go into this interior space.

543
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:22,160
Was that a literal space? No. Is it a merely fictional space? No, it gives you access to your

544
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,680
cognition so you can correct it. It's but it's neither fictional nor literal. Well, what is it?

545
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,640
It's imaginal. And you and you're engaging in ritual because you're seriously playing within

546
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,000
an imaginal rain, rain realm, I should say, in order to bring about the fundamental kinds of

547
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,480
transformation in metacognition that is constitutive of rationality. So at the heart of the rational

548
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,400
is the rich is ritual. But that doesn't mean that ritual is irrational. Ritual has a non

549
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:56,880
propositional rationality. It's not the rationality of coherence. It's the rationality of does your

550
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,680
is what you're doing in your ritual context. Does it transfer systematically? Does it transfer

551
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,160
broadly and deeply to many domains of your life? And does it transform you profoundly? Does it reach

552
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:14,160
into many levels of the psyche and transform those that when when you get systematic transfer and

553
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,120
systemic transformation, that's why rituals survive. That is how they survive. That's their

554
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,000
rationality. That is what we that's that's how we judge a good ritual from a bad rich will.

555
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,960
So you find the ritual and the rational rational mutually profoundly interpenetrating

556
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,520
each other. And for me, that's the where the work of the Kyoto school, especially Nishita,

557
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,400
is so important because Nishita develops, you know, he follows the Zen ritual into the experience,

558
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,240
the experience, not to put that in serious quotations of nothingness. And then he does explicitly,

559
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,840
by the way, a neoplatonic investigation into the grounds of intelligibility. And he gets to the

560
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:59,280
basho. And he shows that the basho and the the Zen experience of nothingness are completely

561
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,840
interdependent and inter reliant. And you get basically Zen, no Platonism.

562
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:10,640
About Whitehead, I think I was just at the McGillchrist conference at the California Institute

563
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,560
for Integral Studies. And of course, you know, and Ian and I agree on, you know, the right hemisphere

564
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,640
is about the Gestalt and the left hemisphere is about the features. And I can give you all the

565
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,760
features of the bird that doesn't give you a bird. You need the Gestalt. That's where the

566
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,400
intelligibility actually hangs. And that's pure relationality. The right, that's what the right

567
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,080
hemisphere is about. I'll just plug in real fast, John. Matt Siegel wanted to be here. He's actually

568
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,520
at a conference. He sends love. And of course, we've talked to him and talked with him, Bonnie.

569
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,840
And he's an excellent process philosopher. I'll just make that nod as you mentioned.

570
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:50,640
Yeah. And I just want to finish very quickly. I don't want to monopolize. And then the thing

571
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,960
there, of course, is the left hemisphere works with parts within a formal system and well-defined

572
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,400
problems. Just getting a paper published now showing that you can't computationalize

573
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:11,120
relevance realization because the process of formalization, the process of translating things

574
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:18,160
into a formal system is not itself a well-defined problem. And it can't therefore be grasped by

575
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:25,360
a formal system. Formalization is not a computational function. It is no way of running a formal system.

576
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:31,280
And so you get that the right hemisphere has priority. And the right hemisphere is about

577
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,360
pure relationality. And Ian and I fundamentally agree on that. The reason I bring that up is

578
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:42,800
in Fuller in his astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being,

579
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,640
makes the argument. And Matt Siegel and the other people, the Whiteheadians agreed that

580
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,800
Whitehead is basically running an argument that was developed by the later Neoplatonist

581
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,800
about pure relationality, about emergence and emanation. What Whitehead adds that I think

582
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,760
James, I know Fuller personally, what James misses is that process of that, I think both of you are

583
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:14,560
putting your finger on, which is the radical creativity. And I think that's what Bard wanted

584
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:22,240
to point out too. Whitehead, the many become one and then one is added. That drawing together

585
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:29,520
of all the widths isn't just a stagnant interrelationality. It's pregnant. It creates

586
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:35,840
a newness, a novelty. And what I want to add to that is that that means we have to introduce

587
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:43,680
into our ontology radical uncertainty. If you have radical emergence in which you can't predict

588
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:51,440
the emergence, but there is some novelty introduced, you are facing radical uncertainty,

589
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:58,400
which means by definition, no formal system can ultimately track reality because formal

590
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:05,120
systems require the exclusion of uncertainty. So if there really is radical creativity,

591
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,360
which is what I think Whitehead adds to the Neoplatonist, and I think what Bard is pointing

592
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:16,080
to, we face an ontology in which uncertainty is not just an epistemic matter. It's not

593
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:23,440
equivalent to probabilistic risk that we can calculate. It is radical uncertainty, which then

594
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:30,880
means we cannot grasp it with a formal system. And I think that's the convergent with what

595
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:40,480
Bard is was saying. And I think that's also part of picking up on what Benita was, I think, pointing

596
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:56,560
to. And I'll end my responses there. There's 17,000 more things I want to say. But I was interested

597
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:07,200
in also, I think sacredness is the bridging notion between the ultimacy of ontology and the

598
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:12,960
ultimacy of axiology. The sacred is that which is most valuable, but it is also bound to what is

599
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,400
most real. And I was trying to make an argument that if you get to this ultimate reality, you

600
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:25,760
have the triple transcendent, which gives you sacredness. And I think if you have sacredness

601
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,040
with unformalizability that is captured, realized, I should say, not captured, wrong word,

602
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:40,640
that is realized in a set of practices, I think you're very much into what religion was doing for

603
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:50,640
us. And that would be my response. Lovely. Okay, so how about I hand it over to Benita and see

604
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,280
what thoughts she wants to pick up on them? We'll really open it up, folks. You can use a question

605
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:02,720
and answer chat. I see one in there already. I'll also check the chat box for this. And I know

606
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,720
we'll come in, but I want to give Benita and Bard an opportunity to respond to that. You guys

607
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,400
certainly ask each other questions as well. And I'll be checking the Q&A as well. So Benita, thoughts?

608
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:20,960
This is so be kind. And so as John said, there's a million things to go through. I want to say

609
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,800
this may be a little bit of plug, but I am on the last panel and we'll have a chance to talk about

610
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:34,800
my conception of God. So I'm going to leave that part out. Although it would be nice to just

611
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,920
put that here. And I want to talk about what I think. First of all, I have to say this because I

612
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:48,560
have to kind of tease Alexander Bard. Okay, so Bruno Moutour wrote this book, Speculative Grace.

613
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:57,440
And it really sounds very much like you creating religion with a flat ontology.

614
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:06,080
And I just think only a true genius like Bard could use Hegel as an icon for a flat ontology.

615
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:16,640
Yeah, so that was genius. So brilliant. But I guess what I want to do is kind of

616
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:27,280
perform what I think Whitehead is doing. And that is everything we said about the difference

617
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:33,440
between the true and real. So that's the bird chair. And then he says, so then what do I have?

618
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:43,280
What do I have to experience reality? And basically what he boils it down to is I have

619
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:49,360
what the Buddhists would call self validating experience of the real. And this is a feeling,

620
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:56,720
that the most fundamental way I can express what this experience is, is a feeling that things are

621
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:08,080
real. And so from this, he says, as I interpret him, as in my fantasy of being with Whitehead,

622
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:16,080
he then says, well, if this is, so instead of having like a metaphysical ground, this is what

623
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:23,360
I truly believe is the most fundamental thing I can say about myself. And then he makes his leap.

624
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:30,960
This is the metaphysical leap. Maybe all of reality works on this template. What if all of

625
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:37,760
reality, maybe it's not just a coincidence that my experience is that this self validating feeling

626
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:45,520
that something is real. And in this feeling itself validates two things. And this is where the

627
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:52,800
transcendent comes in. It validates that my experience is real and replete. It is whole and

628
01:03:52,800 --> 01:04:01,680
full. But it also validates that it's not complete. That there's a remainder in the cosmos. And this

629
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:11,680
creates the sense that there is more reality. So this is extremely important experience. And

630
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,160
I believe this is the kind of experience that sustained Whitehead's work. I've never read

631
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:24,880
a biography of him, but that it brings true to me. And I just want to combine this with something

632
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:34,160
that Diana Fascia says. She's a student of Panseps. And she talks about the clinical

633
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:43,440
experience of transformants, that the psychology, the psychologist and the client are working

634
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:50,960
toward this, what she calls, she says, it's an evolutionary arc that's deeply wired in humans

635
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:59,120
for transformants. And that truth in this sense, which is reality, is this trust or comes from

636
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:06,720
the word trough or trust. It's this inner understanding of clarity that is the marker for

637
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:15,440
awakening of perception. It emerges from awakened perception as a core truth or trust to trust

638
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:23,760
to truth is to behold. And so I think that these kinds of languages, these kinds of

639
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:39,760
confidence in the human experience is a potential point at which we can begin to

640
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:54,880
investigate and share and sing and celebrate the confidence of the real and share this peculiar

641
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,680
sense that the real is always never complete. And there's always a latency in our experience. So

642
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:08,960
yeah, that's what I'd like to put in the space. That's awesome. I did not expect Diana Fascia to

643
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:16,320
pop up. I'm a fan of hers, AEDT, and that's Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Approaches.

644
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:24,080
And it is absolutely the case that modern, emotion focused elements, gestalt frameworks,

645
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,600
to me, the word that I would definitely want us to hit here is primate mindedness.

646
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,640
The mind, the idea that the mind is a propositional reflector that's going to represent,

647
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,840
and that's what's split off, is one of the deep errors of the Enlightenment. Mindedness is the

648
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:50,560
embodied contact. And clinically, what we see so much of is a disconnect, a fundamental propositional

649
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:56,080
disconnect. You can argue, certainly you, McGill, because John, and saying modern society in part

650
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:02,640
is propositionally personhood disconnected from the primate embodiedness. And so much of what

651
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,480
we do clinically is attempt to connect to that in a relational space that creates a shared,

652
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:15,040
non-propositional, intersubjected, I'd call it a mind-to-be space, to connect to the real.

653
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,920
And it's so lovely to see that bridge happen in terms of me as a clinician. That's sort of an

654
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,320
unexpected turn, so I just had to prop in there. Let me hand it over to Bard, and then we'll really

655
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:31,840
start to let's, you know, engage in question and answer from the audience and whatnot.

656
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,640
So, there's two quick responses to Bonita and Greg, because we've been in a lot of conversations,

657
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:42,960
and we'll be at that. This is whited at his Hegelian vest. And please remember, I use Hegel for

658
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,360
method. Hegel was wrong on many things. John can be short of that. He was wrong on many things,

659
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:52,400
but he was brilliant when it comes to method, because with Hegelian dialectics, we arrive in

660
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:59,360
Western philosophy with a complete set of how to think relationalism. And whited just does the

661
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:04,480
same thing. And that remainder, that's exactly the negation within the subject in Hegel. So,

662
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:11,120
you have those things there. So, perfect, Bonita. And as for you, Greg, this is why I am as a

663
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:16,480
psych analyst, I am fighting to get psych analysis out of the ditch of science, because as a science

664
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,520
psych analysis failed miserably in 20th century, but it took off and became a philosophical

665
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:28,080
discipline. And as a philosophical discipline, the 20th century was, it was anthropology became

666
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,600
philosophy. It was psych analysis became philosophy. And most of all, you know, to do Hegel, I had to

667
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,200
do Marshall McLuhan first, because there's no media theory in Hegel. Hegel thinks ideas develop

668
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,360
over time. No, they don't. What develops is, of course, again, relations between human beings

669
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,800
and different technologies. And because different technologies develop over time,

670
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,800
they change the life world we're in. And we actually take to take, we tend to take to the

671
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,960
technologies and proven our lives run the ones to make our miserable. And because we do that,

672
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,520
we can then expand it to learn how to read, write, count, and we can mass duplicate new kinds of

673
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,600
amazing things we do. And that's exactly why I think Hegel is only method and nothing else.

674
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,200
Leave Hegel for the rest. That's exactly why Marx and Darwin, the other guys who came after

675
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:13,200
Hegel, all went to the material real world and threw it at Hegel with the dialectical method.

676
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,640
But the method is great. So I, this is why I'm a great fan of Greg and where I'm involved with

677
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:26,080
the Utah, okay, Utah, is it called Utah? Utah. Utah is great. Utah, because I really believe

678
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,960
psychology needs a reformation. It needs a massive reformation. They get stuck as a service to

679
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,600
governments, basically to fix people to send them back to work over the past 50 to 100 years.

680
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,800
And what I loved about Greg's passion was the fact that he said, I'm a psychologist,

681
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,560
I'm going to take psychology seriously. I'm going to, I'm going to do what Aristotle

682
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:48,320
meant with psycho and logos and do real psychology. And this is exactly why I totally support the

683
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:53,440
attempt to do a proper psychology as a science, which of course then connects to John's work

684
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,480
as a cognitive scientist. These are great scientists, scientists, we need more of them.

685
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:04,800
Okay. So for me to do psych analysis is now to do strictly an art. It's nothing but an art.

686
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,680
It's a philosophical art. For me, psychoanalysis performing through people is basically taking

687
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,680
the entire history of philosophy down to one single human being and then put their

688
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,880
divigiality into philosophical perspective. It's teaching people how to do a philosophy

689
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,720
about themselves. That's a cycle of it. So psychoanalysis, I work today with psychiatry,

690
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,880
and I work today with psychologists. What I do is I arrange teams here at Stockholm

691
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,320
where there's psychologists, there's psychiatrists, and there's a psychoanalyst.

692
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:36,400
And there are three different perspectives looking at human beings and it's stunning

693
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,200
how quickly we can get to results and solve problems and give people a quality of life

694
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,200
and heal, right? So, so I'm all for this. Again,

695
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,880
narratology, like I told you, when you have a dialectical relation between three things,

696
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,880
it's usually very, very productive. Don't try to unify them into one thing.

697
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,600
Don't try to turn logos, pathos and mythos into one thing. Keep them separate, live with the

698
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,800
dichotomies. This is Hegel, live the dichotomies and it's going to be productive and it's going

699
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,800
to be great. Okay. Now, now I want to respond to John, because I'm just going to write a word

700
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,080
down here in the chat channel. I'm going to put my glasses on and write it down,

701
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,920
because this is the next project I'm involved with and I'm thrilled about. It's probably my

702
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,880
seventh book and everything else I'm doing. Zoophism with a Z. So here's the take. When I

703
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,480
started traveling to Asia in the 1980s and realized the religion and philosophy had to

704
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,120
meet again and Eastern spirituality was amazing. And I was totally with Ken Wilber that it would

705
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,440
be embarrassing for my generation of philosophers to start with the Greeks once over again.

706
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,640
No, it didn't start with the Greeks. The Greeks just wrote a lot. The Arabs saved their texts

707
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,480
and the Arabs saved the texts for us. And then we, inside, we made up the Greek system,

708
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,920
you know, the cradle civilization, whatever, and this sort of mythology about Europe.

709
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,160
Josephine Quinn's new book, How the World Made the West, amazing book, better than sapiens or

710
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,560
whatever. It's the biggest, best history book ever written by a woman from the UK and it just

711
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,440
kills the idea. The Greeks started civilization. So what I did is that was that I started looking

712
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:06,880
into Asian philosophy and I started into looking into the Indian and the Chinese and Japanese and

713
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,680
the Persian traditions. And then I discovered that the Persian tradition is the original Greek

714
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:18,720
philosophy. The word philosophy is from about 600 before Christ. It was used already by

715
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:24,160
Indian Iranians 1,100 years earlier as Maas Dal Yassna in Avestan Persian, which means the

716
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:29,200
love of wisdom. Basically, the Greeks just bought it and he had the keys Heraclitus. So

717
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:35,280
for all these things about Neoplatonism and Zen, if you look at the Silk Road and you look at the

718
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,600
Silk Road Triad, as I call it, which is the traditions of Buddhism with Shiaism as well

719
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:44,160
in India. And then you got Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrianism in Persia. And then you got

720
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,160
Daoism in China. Then you got all these different spiritual schools that would never really be

721
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,760
fought with each other. No recorded conflicts whatsoever. Basically, just one from one way

722
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,320
to the next along the Silk Road and you found slightly different variations of the same spiritual

723
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,840
themes. Trade routes, great. Whatever spirituality we go into next historically is human beings.

724
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,360
We should definitely look at the trade routes for inspiration because these religions are

725
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,640
non-digmatic. They're spiritual schools, they're follow practices, they're follow rituals, and

726
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:15,280
they basically fix our lives every day. So we get rid of the destructive bullshit and our mindset,

727
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,920
drop it somewhere and stay with the constructive mindset and build on that.

728
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,480
And so when I started Zoroastrianism, the original texts, the Gathas and the Saint of Vesta,

729
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,320
translated by Germans in the 19th century, I discovered, wait, this is exactly Heraclitus.

730
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,280
Heraclitus said the Greeks should not be Greeks. Heraclitus said we were Persians. We're part of

731
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,280
the Persian Empire. It was wrong we've been Persian, right? Heraclitus maybe even was Persian,

732
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,600
but the thing with Heraclitus is that by comparing Heraclitus fragments with Zoroastrian Gathas,

733
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,040
which I did 30 years ago, I discovered this is going to be the gold mine I'm going to work from.

734
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:52,000
And what I'm now doing, what we're probably doing now is basically the Zed in Zufism is,

735
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,520
of course, Zufism, be taking back Zufism from its origin. Zufism, taking it away from Islam.

736
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,080
Sorry guys, but you didn't invent this, you know, you always hated it and you always badmouthed it

737
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:07,040
because it was modest and all those things that we love. So basically Zufism is a modest

738
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,000
reinterpretation of Zufism as older than Islam. And we then discovered that this is exactly

739
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,240
what Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met. And Zoroastrianism and Buddhism met in contemporary

740
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:20,800
Central Asia. And of course, out of that, we got Bodhidharma, who was not a prince from India,

741
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,640
was a trader from Sogna. We got Babasavana, who is not an Indian Prince. He was another trader.

742
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,400
He came from Tajikistan today and he came to Tibet. So Varayana and Zen are just to be drenched,

743
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:38,480
drenched in Persian philosophy as much as their Chinese were Indian. And these are the richest

744
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,800
traditions I can find in the world today. See, if I'm going to do religion and philosophy and go back

745
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:47,760
5,000 years and go to find the gold mines and do whatever we can do today to understand ourselves

746
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,320
and our history as humans, this is the gold mine I'm totally obsessed with. I can't do Peru and

747
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,840
Mexico too. Other guys have to do that. But I'm totally obsessed with duration and with heritage

748
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,720
and I think where John and I are both heading, maybe this is the future where we can go into

749
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:07,360
conversation future, I think we're heading is that if I pursue Zufism, I mean, when John just

750
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:14,240
mentioned the Kyoto school, chairs came out of my eyes right away. These are my months I've spent

751
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:19,200
in Zen temples in Korea and Japan. This is exactly what I love the most about this conversation.

752
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,520
So I'm just dropping towards Zufism for the first time here because my team here in Scandinavia

753
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,280
agreed. We call each other Zufis now. You can call it Zen Zufis if you like, but we are practicing

754
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:34,480
now living a Zufism and we're obviously finding other Zufis out there around the world who also

755
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,560
managed to live with this sort of monist spiritual tradition with daily practices.

756
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,600
So just want to put that out there and then say that Neoplatonism, maybe then John can dig deeper

757
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,960
to whatever. I don't get too stuck with the Neoplatonist. I love Hellenism. I think Hellenism

758
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:54,480
was the most fantastic thing ever. But for me, it's actually deeper. I think before Plato, we go

759
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:59,920
before Plato with the priests of critics, we discovered they did philosophy flux. They did

760
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:06,400
Relationalism. Relationalism is the oldest philosophy. It's rather later when, you know,

761
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,840
the Greeks start thinking and mathematics comes into the picture, Pythagoras over there,

762
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,280
and there's so fatigued with mathematics, they think, well, there could be perfect forms out there.

763
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,720
Well, that's an interesting idea, but it's not actually how the world operates.

764
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,120
Today, it's the computer scientists with zeros and ones. And if they have billions of dollars,

765
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,680
think they're philosophers when they're really dangerous. So we have to respond to that whole

766
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:31,440
sort of computer science attempt to turn the world into zeros and ones and nothing but zeros and ones

767
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:37,040
and create this sort of deterministic nightmare that comes out of it and respond to that with what

768
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:45,280
John perfectly calls the radical uncertainty. The radical uncertainty is Hegel's. We are terrified

769
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:52,240
of our freedom because the future is completely contingent. It is the past which is a necessity

770
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:58,560
because the past is locked up. History in Hegel is like a zigzag. So everything the zigzag is

771
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,800
the past. Don't change that. Amofati, Nietzsche said, just accept that whatever happened happened.

772
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:09,440
That's factual truth. But the future is completely scaringly contingent and open and we are active

773
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:14,080
agents engaged in the future. And for me, that's being a Sufi. So I'll leave it at that.

774
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,080
Well, lovely. John, you want to respond to that? And then I'll take some questions from the audience.

775
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,160
Yeah. Bart, you may be pleased to know that the next big series I'm working on and it's going to

776
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,960
be Titanically Bigger than my previous two. I'm going to go on like on location. It's going to be at

777
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:36,320
different levels of media presentation. A macro, a mezzo and a micro is called the Philosophical

778
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:42,400
Silk Road in which I actually pick up the proposal. Now, I talk about Xanthoplatonism,

779
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:50,080
but we can quibble about things like that. I think Neil Platonism plays a role in Sufism too.

780
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:57,200
But I don't want to get mired in a historical argumentation here. I think the orientation

781
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:04,640
is very much aligned. And true to my criticism of Hegel, I'm not going to merely talk about this.

782
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,840
This has become a personal pilgrimage for me. I'm going through a purgation process right now

783
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,600
that I have not called for, but has called me in which I'm fundamentally preparing to actually go

784
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:21,360
to these places and be transformed by looking at the past, by also drenching myself in what I call

785
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:32,000
the geo-philosophy, the culture and the history. And so making myself a vehicle that's too pretentious,

786
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,080
at least put myself in service of the advent of the sacred that is happening right now

787
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,400
in response to the meeting crisis. But it seems like what you are talking about and what

788
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,120
I'm talking about, though not identical or deeply convergent. So I just wanted to reply to that.

789
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,880
That's the next big project, right? So that's really lovely. And actually,

790
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,160
there's a question from Victor. So I'm going to go to some Q&A. I'll see if I can pick it up

791
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:01,040
in the chat if there are other kinds of elements. If Victor wants to unmute, he can read this or

792
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:08,800
I will read it for him. I think it's a fascinating question. Wait a second. I'm not sure. Why don't

793
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,320
I go ahead and read it, Victor, if you're around and you can unmute and then you can dialogue.

794
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:19,920
And so here's the question. Our being in an emergence pervades our collective awareness,

795
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:27,360
gestured at as a time between worlds. How can a philosophy of transcendental emergentism

796
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:35,520
inform science such that the preferable emerges? Where do we want to go? What do we cultivate?

797
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:41,040
What's the relationship, I think, between facts and values? Is there a direction where we're

798
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,680
cultivating preferable? I hope I don't put too many words in Victor's mouth. But I'll throw that

799
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:51,040
out there and see if somebody wants to pick up. What are we oriented toward? What are we trying

800
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,280
to do in form of science? I would also wonder also about practices, et cetera.

801
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,640
I would, first of all, say that one of the things that comes out of this, and Pickstock does a lot

802
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,000
of work on this and so does filler, but other people have, I've mentioned case beer, putnam,

803
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,880
some of my own work. The fact value distinction, the is-ot distinction, is breaking down.

804
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,600
It doesn't mean there aren't differences, but there are differences like the difference between

805
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:23,600
two colors, right? They're on a continuum of degree and they're not differences in kind.

806
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:30,000
You can't actually ever state a fact that is not simultaneously a value judgment.

807
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,400
You can't make any value judgment that is not simultaneously a statement of fact.

808
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:40,880
They are non-logically identical, but they are inseparably interpenetratingly bound to one

809
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:46,880
another. And I think as long as we still frame this as we have to solve the is-ot problem,

810
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,840
no. I don't often invoke Wittgenstein, but here's where I think Wittgenstein is

811
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:56,800
appropriate. We don't solve the is-ot problem. We are in a place now where we dissolve it,

812
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:03,200
and then we get back to an ontology that allows us for profound connectedness to reality.

813
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:12,560
And I think for me, any way forward that doesn't prioritize that connectedness

814
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:21,360
to the religio in a way that is rationally self-confident, sending, rationally self-correcting,

815
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,320
all that sort of stuff, all the stuff we've been talking about here, and that's part of

816
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,560
what Hegel was on about. It is rationally self-correcting. It's just not strictly

817
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,520
syllogistic logic, right? Because the process is to be self-correcting or you can't distinguish

818
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:42,400
foolishness from wisdom. But I think for me, what comes out of this, and I can make a deeper

819
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:50,240
argument, but wise love, agopic love, like what is guiding you to loving more wisely,

820
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:55,040
and what is allowing you to love wisdom in an interpenetrating manner. I think

821
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:03,760
if people are looking for a practical normativity to guide them in practice, that's important.

822
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,320
And then one other thing I would say is give up the monological standpoint.

823
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:14,800
The evidence is now overwhelming. We reason better collectively than we do individually.

824
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:21,200
Experimental evidence is merging. And this is what I would say, not pushback on Bard. I think this is

825
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,520
amplification. The dialectic has to be accompanied with a diologos, which is

826
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,680
dialogical practice, because that gives you the cognitive agent that is actually capable of doing

827
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:40,720
this new kind of realization of a new kind of ontology, in which fact and value are no longer

828
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,440
separate, in which theory and data are no longer separate, in which analytic and synthetic are

829
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:52,720
no longer separate, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Bard is right. This is hard, but it is already

830
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:58,080
happening. And I think we should orient to the places. Here is one of them, and there are many

831
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:05,360
others where it's happening. And we should do our best to culturally try to bind all these places

832
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:12,320
and practices together. That would be my recommendation. I agree totally with John here.

833
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,120
It's just called Nartological Dialectics in my dingo, but it's exactly the same thing. So it's

834
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:22,080
a very humbling kind of standard dialectics works, and you can't arrive at a fixed point anytime.

835
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:26,000
I think the really scary thing right now out there is that the people who were

836
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,120
diabetic have gone fundamentalist and gone hysterical, as we're seeing in the Middle East

837
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:35,760
right now. That's terrifying, especially if these guys have access to atomic bombs and can blow us

838
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,960
all up. That's a very, very real threat. And the reason why it goes hysterical is because

839
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:47,520
fundamentalism is like the end state of something that's already dead. It's like imagine an ideology

840
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,520
which is zombie-like. It is almost dead. So the last thing you do is that if God does not intervene

841
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,760
in the world as he should do according to your dogma, you have to act on God's behalf.

842
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,440
The scary thing right now with Islam and Christianity is they might get the armageddon

843
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:09,440
they prophesied about, but it's all self-made. This is terrifying. This is very, very real.

844
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:15,600
My recommendation then is to say the revolution is currently completely on the technological side,

845
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,560
and that's scary because the revolution is going hay-walk right now and needs to be contained.

846
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:27,280
For me as a human, that means I react exactly the opposite way. I retract. The most radical thing to

847
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:33,680
do as a human today is to retract, like John so wisely says, like we all do here, retract, step

848
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:40,560
back, go into retreat, observe the world from the outside. And yeah, it's about love. It's about love.

849
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,000
It's about finding that spot where that love is and feeling, be human. This is why we can't do

850
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,320
for loss without spirituality any longer. It's just another data. But what I'm saying is that

851
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:58,080
what Hegel did is that he basically said his absolute is on the meta-level precisely because

852
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:03,920
he doesn't allow any absolute on the formal level. That's exactly why Hegel is great in the sense

853
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,640
that he says that the only absolute I have is that there is no absolute in the sense that

854
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:14,240
there is only movement and flux all the time, and all we can do then we try to think those fluxes

855
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:20,080
are dialectical processing and dialectical thinking. And that's what we can do to not arrive at any

856
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,120
fixed point, only temporary solutions to temporary problems. And that's what we do all the time.

857
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:31,120
That means it's incredibly anti-dogmatic. That's the whole point. And the anti-dogmatism is exactly

858
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,240
what we need more of the world today. Whenever you can, if you're going to be a missionary about

859
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:39,280
anything today, you're going to be a missionary about anti-dogmatic, go anti-dogmatic and dissolve

860
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,080
these dogmas out there because they're the ones that are really affecting us.

861
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,880
Bonnie, did you yet want me to respond to that?

862
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:52,480
Yeah, I wanted to ping on what was where John and Barb were talking about philosophy is

863
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:59,200
dialogic. And then I saw a question pop up in the chat, could Bonnie give us examples of fierce

864
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:07,440
naturalism? So I can kind of answer, build on the dialogic by answering with what I would call

865
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:13,760
fierce naturalism. Okay, so on the one hand, there's on one level, I completely agree that

866
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:23,520
philosophy is dialogical. But I think we there's so the fierce naturalism would say yes,

867
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:31,040
but not dialogic at the level of words and thinking with thoughts. And this is where

868
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,280
if you think of the concept of a stack, I think that so for example,

869
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:46,880
if you can imagine atoms, atoms are dialogical, they're resonance with each other, there's either

870
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:52,080
constructive or deconstructive interference. And this is a kind of feeling between the

871
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:58,560
resonance. And then we get to sentience. And sentience is a dialogue through touch,

872
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,760
you know, so the worm oscillating in an ordered environment is touching the environment.

873
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:11,520
So that's I touch, and then we have cognizance, where these are gestures, these are physical,

874
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:17,680
in emotional aphid laden gestures at the animal mind level, let's say, and that's

875
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:24,880
dialogic gestures are dialogic gesture is touch at a distance. And then we get into the Hellenistic

876
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:30,960
and the lyrical philosophies, pre Socratic philosophies, where people are saying or singing.

877
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:38,400
So this is a calm response, the Psalms and the lyrical Hellenistic philosophy. So you just feel

878
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:49,680
what this is, this I touch, I gesture, I say, I sing, then you get into the great epic of Gilgamesh

879
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:55,760
and the narratives of the Iliad and the Odyssey. And now we're right at the heels of the Socratic

880
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:02,960
time. And this is when we're starting to tell. So instead of like lyrical and saying with that

881
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:08,400
with, you know, saying in a calm response, you have someone telling the whole history of the

882
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:15,920
people, the whole history of, you know, Troy, and the whole history and these become so there's a

883
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:23,040
reduction in the dialogical nature at this point in history. And then with the Socratics,

884
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:30,880
I would argue that becomes I name. So instead of telling a story of a man who was courageous,

885
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,960
but also an asshole to his wife, and all these kinds of very complex ways in which humans in

886
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:43,120
nature show up in the as in the allegories, we start to say, Well, that's too confusing, we never

887
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:50,800
see a real courageous man, because sometimes he's not courageous. So let's extract and isolate these

888
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:58,720
virtues, these variables from reality, and name them. And this is, I think, where we're the next

889
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:07,120
phase is now we name, then we're going to compute. Okay. So I see this progression that the telling

890
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:14,880
and then the naming is a bottleneck. And so we go from sentience, cognizance, consciousness,

891
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:22,400
to reflexive awareness. And this is where we get to I tell, I name, I compute. So it's the

892
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:28,320
progressive simulation of the self. And then we start dialoguing with the self. And I think this

893
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:35,040
is a bottleneck. So what we're doing in we call it lyric culture is now we want to move from

894
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:41,920
reflexive awareness to receptive awareness. So there's an opening as john describes very well,

895
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:48,640
I see I see with the eye of the soul. This is kind of a Gnostic insight. And then you go from

896
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:53,200
receptive awareness to open awareness. So receptive awareness, you still have the sense that

897
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:01,040
you're receiving perceptions and open awareness is more like I'm feeling. And so we're back to

898
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:09,440
Whitehead's insight that there's a resounding resonance of feeling that I am embedded it,

899
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:15,760
I'm not I'm not just receiving it. And then we I mean, this is this is all, you know,

900
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,840
a methodology. And then from there, you become you get the sense of the I am. And this is the

901
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:30,400
transcendent sense of the radiant being of reality or the radiance being the radiance of God,

902
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:36,400
or the radiance of the divine. And you find that within yourself. And the naming the telling

903
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:43,280
and the naming and the computing are in the wrong direction. We have to dial that back and move to

904
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:50,240
our receptive awareness, open awareness, and the sense of original radiance, which you might say

905
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:58,560
is how the universe started. So that's kind of like a fierce naturalism take on this conversation.

906
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,000
And I thank you for the opportunity to put it on the table. It's not completely resonant with

907
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:14,240
what else we've been talking about. Okay. What I'd like to do now is I've got another question.

908
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:19,360
Second one that came up, this is from Spencer. I'll read it, Spencer, certainly feel free to

909
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:25,600
pop in. But I'll read this is actually directed at Alexander Bard. How do you feel about the idea

910
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,880
that Hegel needs to be read together with Schelling and later ficta 1804 plus to be fully

911
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,680
relationally understood, for instance, to fully read Hegel with whitehead and delused?

912
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:42,480
That's where the question ends if Spencer wants to. So where does Hegel fit?

913
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:47,600
Yeah, okay. But that's been done. That's been done a lot. Hegel is put together with the German

914
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:54,640
idealists, and he's not an idealist. He's really a dialectician. The way I do Hegel is I do Hegel's

915
01:31:54,640 --> 01:32:00,240
method. And then I provocatively call myself a pan dialecticist. I think fundamentally,

916
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:03,600
everything in the universe, the only thing I can say about all the different mergers vectors,

917
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,680
if they all seem to have some kind of dialectical quality to them. So I just call myself a pan

918
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,680
dialecticist. Then I learned the lesson from Hegel. No, what wasn't done is the weird artificial

919
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:17,440
opposition between Hegel and Nietzsche. When I started reading the guys my teenage years,

920
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:22,880
he was like, they're compatible. They're perfectly compatible. I mean, Nietzsche's armor fought

921
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:28,400
which is his, you know, axiology. It's just where his values start from. It's exactly like Hegel's

922
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,400
the necessity of the past and scared of the contingency of the future and the freedom. It's

923
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:37,440
exactly affirmation in Nietzsche. They're perfectly compatible. And I'm glad the whole new generation

924
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,960
today, at least in Europe, they're all reading Hegel and Nietzsche through each other, which is

925
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,920
incredibly productive to get all the best uses bits out of these amazing 90s century thinkers.

926
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:52,000
Then when you start looking at the 20th century, I found Whited, who I loved to bits,

927
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:59,200
and he also does relationalism. And it's almost like Whited. Deleuze, of course, later in France,

928
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:02,720
in the late 20th century, Deleuze does the same thing with Guattari in France,

929
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:07,360
and they're amazing thinkers. I love Deleuze and Foucault. These are the guys I grew up with.

930
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:13,680
But Deleuze's attempt at trying to do Hegel as if Hegel did not exist is exactly what Whited

931
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:19,840
actually did. Whited did Hegel as if Hegel did not exist, and then applied on the natural sciences

932
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:25,120
and mathematics and tons of stuff that Hegel was not aware of, which is why I think Whited is fantastic.

933
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:30,720
So I prefer to use the Hegelian method and read it through the 20th century thinkers and then try

934
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:35,600
to read it through us and try to read it through 20th century philosophy, what the Hegelian method

935
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:41,840
can mean today. But as method, it is amazing. And I'm so glad that John, who's so fantastic,

936
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:46,000
is now going to put his head on to Hegel because the day for Varkey goes on Hegel.

937
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:54,240
That's got to be enormous. Okay. I've got a question here from Kevin Katwas.

938
01:33:55,520 --> 01:34:03,440
And this question is, how does an ontology of pure relationality relate to the emerging digital

939
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:09,840
network decentralized institutions of the future? How does an ontology of pure relationality relate

940
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,400
to an emerging digital network and decentralized institutions of the future?

941
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:22,480
I guess that's kind of my question again anyway. It's the paradigm we're in right now is the network

942
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:27,600
dynamical paradigm. Some call it digital, some call it the internet, some call it AI, whatever.

943
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,640
What happened is the technology now is going global. We get satellites everywhere. Everything is

944
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:37,280
interconnected. The threat there is to arrive in a surveillance police state. We don't want that. So

945
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:41,760
I'm totally with decentralization and try to think how can we still have a network dynamical

946
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,320
society with all its benefits but still lived in a decentralized way? That's a fairly difficult

947
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:52,720
question to solve. Is it typical axiological question today? So we are networked up because we

948
01:34:52,720 --> 01:35:00,240
I've got a question here from Cody Palmer. Does a neoplatonic framework create an ontological

949
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:09,440
structure? Greg, can you hear us? I think you couldn't hear you, Alexander. I think that's a

950
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:19,840
problem. All right. Greg, are you still there? He looks frozen. Yeah, that's Alexander just

951
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,080
hanging on a sec. I think that's what happened there. I don't think he was being rude. I think

952
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,200
he thought you'd stopped. Yeah.

953
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,840
I could just finish the answer as soon as he can get where to back because the rest of you are all

954
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:43,120
here, right? It was just Greg's problem, right? Yeah. He'll be back. So I'm just going to finish

955
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,160
the question. The thing is that I'm with Marsha McLuhan, an amazing philosopher, by the way,

956
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:53,280
in that media we use. I'm going to show you this because the last time you said him,

957
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,880
did you have you read his Remedian book? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I mean,

958
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,720
if anybody's going to save the pope, it's going to be Marsha McLuhan, the best Catholic in the

959
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:10,800
world, right? But the thing is that the media we use will also affect how we think. And that's why

960
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:15,280
this sort of minoritarian thinking that Hegel and White did practice at the time is not

961
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:19,600
becoming majoritarian. We're all starting to think like they think because living in a world

962
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,400
drenched in network relations and we try to figure out how relations must work. And it's fantastic

963
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:29,840
to live in a relations universe. So why not? But that's why that's why relations become a big

964
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,160
topic because it actually reflects the technological environments we are in right now.

965
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,640
I'd like to answer to that too, then, while we wait for Greg to come back.

966
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:47,440
And I think this is actually convergent with what Bart is saying. What you still have,

967
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,920
and this goes to what we're now in what's called the fourth rationality debate. We've had a whole

968
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:57,360
bunch. What is rationality? You still have people claiming that this can ultimately be grasped in

969
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:05,440
an a priori axiomatic system, all of this. And that that is kind of the epistemological version

970
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:12,320
of the zombie fundamentalism that Bart was pointing to, but within a scientific, scientific

971
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:19,520
framework. And part of what we try to argue in two papers, one is

972
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,760
relevance, rationality and relevance realization. The other one is naturalizing

973
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,320
relevance realization. Is that project is actually doomed? You can't do it that way.

974
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:34,640
It's not that there aren't top down aspects, but you can't step out. This is Hegel. You can't

975
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:40,320
step out and give an a priori top down, right? Optimization that will work algorithmically

976
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:46,400
across all possible contexts. This is the last ditch attempt that is being made in order to

977
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:53,280
wrestle with the network reality and the dynamic system reality we're realizing here. And I think

978
01:37:54,080 --> 01:38:02,000
that is a kind of scientific fundamentalism that is strongly analogous to a lot of religious

979
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:10,240
fundamentalisms that we have. But because they typically don't blow up buildings or what not

980
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,680
they don't get the deserved attention. But if you don't think these people are going to cause

981
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:22,000
terrific suffering, if they succeed, I think you're being foolish. So I would want to point out that

982
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:30,880
there is an attempt to recapture all of what Bart was pointing to, right, about network dynamics

983
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:39,680
in a top down, a priori axionomic formal systemization. And I think this is the last ditch

984
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:47,440
attempt. And so I think that has to be properly challenged and resisted. I've been trying to do

985
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:55,520
so, by the way. And I think other people are. I totally agree with John. That's why I said

986
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,320
Surveillance Police State. Yes. And this book Processing Event is a manifesto against that

987
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,080
happening. The scientist fundamentalists are going to go for the surveillance police state and they're

988
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:07,360
going to do good in the world. It's like vulgar Platonism. They're going to go for the good in

989
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:11,840
the world by controlling absolutely everything. Well, that's already happening, because T and

990
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:16,480
Ping is trying to do it in China with vulgar Confucianism, because vulgar Confucianism is

991
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:22,000
exactly vulgar Platonism. And these are the two heritages we got in Eastern and Western thinking

992
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,640
we need to get rid of once and for all. We call them the pillar saint ideologies. The pillar

993
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:32,080
saint ideologies that Confucianism and Platonism at his worst is the little 11 year old boy who

994
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:36,560
threw his wonderful little idea that if everybody did everything the way I think they should do

995
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:41,680
the world will be wonderful and everything be a sunny day forever. And they're there. I mean,

996
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:45,920
most computer scientists I meet when they start to think about philosophy, their mind gets stuck

997
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:50,960
there. I think it's great that you mentioned that here, John. Scientific fundamentalism is

998
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:55,600
exactly, scientific fundamentalism is the right term for that. And it's just as scary as any

999
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,360
of the other fundamentalists, especially these guys have so much power and influence today.

1000
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,760
We've got to avoid the surveillance police state precisely because we need an open society

1001
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:09,920
without an open society, all freedom is gone. All right. Hey, folks, I'm back.

1002
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,800
It looks like we have Scott. It's got a question. I'm noting the time here. Why don't we ask Scott

1003
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:23,360
a question, respond to that, and then we'll congeal, give some final thoughts, and then we'll end

1004
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:29,200
the session that way. Scott. Thank you very much. I appreciate having the opportunity to open my mic.

1005
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:34,880
I tried to type the question and it blew up. Alexander, I very much appreciate your rich,

1006
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:43,040
bold understanding of Hegel. And if we're going to talk about Hegel and Whitehead

1007
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:48,720
and be serious about process ontology, then stability becomes a scale relative phenomenon.

1008
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:56,320
In other words, the things, one of the things I've confirmed your speaking language.

1009
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:03,920
Hold on. Okay. Hold on. There you go. Okay. Sorry. I got a zoom thing I had to answer.

1010
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:10,640
A question I have. This is in my work. I look at where you, the things you described,

1011
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,480
where we weren't wrong with thingism. Why would it's difficult to think relationally?

1012
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,880
One of the artifacts of the way dynamical systems work is that dynamic stable states emerge

1013
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:27,760
relatively in a dynamic space. So they're transient. Yet we've confused the stability with

1014
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:35,040
the fixedness. Our thoughts come to be as temporally stable states that come and go in a

1015
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:41,600
hyper complex nervous dynamic. Our words are the same. So I think I just want to get your reaction

1016
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,400
to the idea that we've confused the stable states that our brains necessarily create to have things

1017
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:53,200
we call thoughts. We've confused those abilities with the way the world is, not seeing the actual

1018
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:58,960
multi-scale dynamic work that makes the emergence of temporarily stable states possible. I know

1019
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:05,440
there was a lot, but I had to ask that of you given your talk. Totally agree. That's why the book is

1020
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:12,800
called process and event. In a very, very, very fundamental rudimentary addressing all the

1021
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:16,960
problem of the East and the West, where East and West can learn is that the East got stuck with

1022
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,520
process and I've never met Chinese or an Indian intellectual who didn't agree with me. They got

1023
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:25,760
stuck with the process. The problem was that in Western culture, especially through Islamic

1024
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,000
Christianity, we got so obsessed with the event and we forgot about the process. What then happened

1025
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,360
is that the event itself becomes endlessly repeated. Christ on the cross all the time,

1026
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:39,120
Mohammed storming Mecca all the time, every year again and again, say we're from the back.

1027
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,360
The problem is that reality is process and event, meaning human is process and event,

1028
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:51,280
East and West, man and woman, dynamic relations all the way down. I'm just basically advocating,

1029
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,400
if you can think that the event is the stability and it's temporary, remember it's temporary,

1030
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:01,120
so you can use it and build from, but then things will move on and the new process will start.

1031
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,360
Then what happens is you realize that processes are repeated, but the process is never identical

1032
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:14,640
to the previous lap of the process. That tiny little difference enables you to create an event

1033
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:19,680
and change history forever in a new constructive direction. I think that's a wonderful thought

1034
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:24,880
that any engineer I've ever met is thrilled about hearing because they try to find that little spot

1035
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:29,200
where they can improve on the world every day when they work. So process and event,

1036
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:32,160
that's what the books call that. That's the unity of the two.

1037
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:42,720
All righty, that's lovely. Let me offer a few thoughts first off. First off, thank you all

1038
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:48,720
for really stimulating our 45 minutes. My heart is filled with joy to stay at the primate level

1039
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,800
and the exchange of ideas, the feeling in the room was really good. One thing,

1040
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,680
a couple things I want to mention. One is let's make sure we're clear about where we're locating

1041
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:06,480
how we're entering into this. Certainly, Utah's location is explicit. I appreciated our exchange

1042
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:11,680
being clear where John's coming from. I think where Bernice is coming from. Understanding

1043
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:16,240
where we're entering and then to see the convergence through those various elements,

1044
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:24,480
to me, is really inspiring and fascinating. Another area of convergence I want to mention

1045
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:31,440
with Bard is that narratology with its logos, pathos, and mythos has lots of parallels with

1046
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:36,320
Utah's epistemological pillars of the Tree of Knowledge, the Iquocoin, and the Garden. That's

1047
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:42,480
really a logos, pathos, mythos, frame of reference. I also want to speak to some of what obviously I

1048
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,600
share with John and our hope for transcendent naturalism, at least in relationship to a

1049
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:53,520
strong transcendence of a collective emergence, a collective intelligence that transforms the

1050
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,480
onto epistemological relation. I think that's desperately needed. The last thing I'll say

1051
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:04,960
in relationship to Bonnie is the embodiment of being. Contact with the cutting through

1052
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:10,240
metaphysics down into the experience of being, to me, is absolutely central and we've lost that

1053
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:16,880
in many ways. To regain that is aspects of the core of the task as I see us moving forward.

1054
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:22,800
All of these things, to me, are connecting in particular ways. They're inspiring. They're

1055
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:29,120
spurring lots of thoughts. I'll go to John and then Bonnie and Bard can have the last word and

1056
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:33,760
then we can wrap up. John, any final thoughts you want to share as we bring this to a close?

1057
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:44,800
I found this tremendously fecund. I'm always impressed when there's considerable convergence

1058
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:51,200
and its convergence. There's enough difference. We're not just echo-chambering. Convergence

1059
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:58,320
requires that there's real difference, although they come to shared conclusions,

1060
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:05,120
maybe resolutions is a better word, because that raises the plausibility of the overall framework

1061
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:10,800
dramatically. If Bonita working, I'm not claiming we're completely independent of each other,

1062
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,640
that's ridiculous, but she's working independently. Bard is working independently.

1063
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:18,400
There's significant enough differences between what we're saying that we're not just echoing

1064
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:27,680
each other. As we unwrap, unfold our particular argumentative paths, we come to very similar

1065
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:34,400
kinds of realizations. I think that raises the overall plausibility. I would say that if you

1066
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:41,200
listen to the geist between the three of us, you actually get the best possible argument

1067
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,560
for what is needed right now.

1068
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,320
Lovely. Bonnie?

1069
01:46:51,040 --> 01:47:08,800
Yeah, I just want to end by pointing out a kind of confusion. My work, as you kind of situated

1070
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:21,600
my work, always emphasizes the animal level. But what I hope you can understand from my work

1071
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:27,200
is that I'm not just, you see, the problem is when you work from the kind of stratified

1072
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:34,320
reality that you have, you're saying my work is down there in the animal realm. This is the problem

1073
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:41,360
with the stocks, because my work is saying, okay, this reflexive awareness, we're telling,

1074
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:47,360
we're naming, we're going to compute. Just because this is more on the scene recently,

1075
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:54,240
it could be a mistake. There could be an alternative. It could be the wrong way.

1076
01:47:54,240 --> 01:48:01,040
I'm saying that these other moves come out of our animal nature, but they're beyond the human

1077
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:17,280
condition so far. This is why it's tricky to have always work from that stock, because I'm not a

1078
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:27,600
pagan. You're going like this, you know, I know you know. I just want to end with that. I too found

1079
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:35,680
the conversation lovely and very complex and probably challenging for many people who

1080
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:41,760
stayed stuck with us, because there's so many different worlds popping up. And so yeah,

1081
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:47,840
and thank you all so much for being a part of this. Lovely. I'll just say amen.

1082
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:55,120
Barb? Yeah, I just want to say that this was like the most wonderful check-in with you guys.

1083
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:59,360
I'm sitting here on the other side of the Atlantic and you're some of my best friends in

1084
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:04,640
North America and it's just wonderful to collaborate with you. And I will dig into your work even more

1085
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:10,960
than ever, all three of you. And certainly I'm very inspired. I'm working on a term myself at the

1086
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,640
moment, which was not part of this conversation, but just to point out how inspiring this is.

1087
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,080
And it's called emotional intelligence. And this is the ridiculous thing.

1088
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,640
Intelligence is currently the most important word in our language and it's not being defined by

1089
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,600
anybody. That in itself is terrible. That's a really dangerous position that we're actually

1090
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,920
using the word intelligence as if we knew we're talking about it. There are so many Italian

1091
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:37,600
gents to begin with. And AI is just one of them and a minor one, to be honest about it. So I'm

1092
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:41,360
working with the concept of emotional intelligence, which I think it ties in very nicely with White

1093
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:46,400
Ted and very nicely with Bonita's work, just the example of how inspiring this conversation is.

1094
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:50,800
But that's another conversation altogether. All right, well, maybe we'll have future

1095
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:57,520
conversations then. All right, folks, thank you so much, each of you, for bringing your wisdom.

1096
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:02,800
It's been a real joy. It's lovely to host this in the context of the Utah Consilience Conference

1097
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:08,320
and to think about the kinds of philosophies, metaphysic, empirical experiences of being

1098
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:14,320
oriented toward wisdom in the 21st century. And I love the dance and I appreciate the connection.

1099
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,960
Thanks to everybody. Thanks for all the questions. Super engaging. So what we're doing now is

1100
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,240
basically you got an hour. I think there's plenty to digest here and go for a walk,

1101
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:26,960
get a cup of coffee. We'll be back at one o'clock where you have three options

1102
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:32,080
for three wonderful symposia. And then again, at three o'clock, three options. I'm really

1103
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:36,400
looking forward to the afternoon. I feel like conference off to a great start and go get some

1104
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:43,280
nourishment, share some love, hang out, meditate, etc. We'll see everybody soon. Okay, take care.
