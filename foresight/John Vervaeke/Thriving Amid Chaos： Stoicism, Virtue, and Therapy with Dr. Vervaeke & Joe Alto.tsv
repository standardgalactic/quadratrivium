0	3200	John Varvakey and Sean Coyne have together authored a new book,
3200	7840	Mentoring the Machines. It's a book about artificial intelligence and the path forward
7840	13120	that further develops the arguments of how to align artificial intelligence to human flourishing,
13120	17280	and it sets those arguments into beautiful and accessible writing. It's an incredibly
17280	24240	timely book. In fact, it will be released August 1st, 2023, as a four-part series that will culminate
24240	29840	into a final volume. You can pre-order today a special edition copy that will include a
29920	33840	signed hardback edition. Pre-order in the link in the description below.
34400	40160	Welcome, everybody, to another Voices with Varvakey. I'm very excited here to be talking with Joe
40160	44800	Alto. We are going to be doing an interesting thing. I'll let Joe talk about it a little bit more.
44800	49280	Although he's on Voices with Varvakey, we want you to consider that this is, I'm also on Joe's
49280	54640	channel. We're sort of going to be interviewing each other and talking for both audiences in
54720	60880	integrated fashion. Welcome, Joe. Thank you so much for having me, John. Just a quick introduction,
60880	66240	I guess, about myself. As John just mentioned, I have my own YouTube channel called the Gist
66240	71280	with Joe. That channel is really dedicated to talking to what I consider great minds in the
71280	78240	fields of psychology and philosophy, theology, really just culture in general. I essentially
78240	82800	ask my guests, what's the gist of their intellectual, their artistic, their spiritual
82800	91520	project? We know that distilling what your project is to the gist is a good practice. I like doing
91520	98400	this with my guests, and it usually blossoms into a really beautiful and meaningful conversation
98400	105520	afterwards. That's going to be one part of our conversation today. As John said, I'll be on Voices
105520	111920	with Varvakey. John will be on the gist with Joe. Obviously, my channel is much more teeny tiny than
111920	120000	John's. I guess even further introduce myself. I'm currently studying clinical mental health
120000	131120	counseling. I am the campus minister at a public university in Cleveland, Ohio, and just very
131120	140640	interested in pursuing what my, as a Catholic man with the church fathers or what other great
140640	145360	thinkers in philosophy in general would consider the good, the true, the beautiful. I'm on that
145360	152720	search myself. It's a hard, long search, but having conversations with great thinkers is
152720	157200	something that helps me with that endeavor. I'm just really honored to be on today. Thank you so much,
157200	166400	Jen. Thank you, Joe. Let me go first. I'll happily answer your gist question. On my side,
166400	173360	I guess what I'm really interested in hearing from you and talking about it a bit is how does
173360	181680	my work intersect with your pursuit, your quest as a Catholic man to track the true, the good, and
181680	189200	the beautiful? How does my work, like, does it help? Does it afford? Does it challenge? Is it a
189200	194400	problem? Well, it definitely does a lot. It definitely does a lot. Challenge is one really
194400	202080	good thing. Help is another. It helps a lot. And so, you know, as a Catholic, I will explain,
202080	206800	so, you know, I'm a Catholic campus minister, but I'm also studying intensively right now.
206800	214160	I'll be able to practice next April. I actually start my clinical internship in a couple weeks,
214160	219680	so I actually start seeing fiction soon. So I'm on this journey right now as I stated in clinical
219680	227760	mental health. And, you know, I don't have any plans of ever advertising myself, per se, as a
227760	234560	Catholic counselor. I actually think, and you know what, anyone who does religious specific
234560	240480	counseling, that's very needed. And I laud, you know, anyone who's watching who does, like I said,
240480	250160	religious specific counseling. However, given just my charisms, my personality, just what my
251040	257760	goal in this profession is, I don't necessarily plan on ever advertising myself as a Catholic
257760	265920	counselor. However, I do believe that in my, it's in my opinion that counseling, you know, psychotherapy
266800	274240	is, one can consider a spiritual or religious endeavor. There's many Christian, there's many
274240	281120	Buddhists, there's many Islamic, there's many Jewish, there's really all, every major, you know,
281120	287360	world religion and the ethos of that religion, you can see elements of that in the counseling
287360	293440	profession, right? And so, it's not going to ever be explicit, but you know, it's more so in the
293440	302000	implicit of my counseling, that I want to, well, that I will express or exude my Christian faith
302000	307040	that ever, without ever, possibly ever stating, hey, I'm a Christian man. And so, John, what is
307040	314640	your work coming in for this? So, although I've only had a couple encounters, right, with people
314640	321920	coming to counseling, but in my, in my time in classes, in my work reading the great thinkers of
321920	327920	both, you know, just the psychological field and just even the counseling field, I do know that,
328800	333200	and although I don't have any stats to prove it, this is more operating the anecdote right here,
334080	340400	I do know that many people go to counseling, not for, well, what we would consider, what the DSM
340400	345280	would consider, you know, a particular disorder, right? So, not everyone, so people who are depressed
345920	352800	don't always have a major depressive episode or major depressive disorder, right? People who are
352800	359760	anxious don't always have a specific phobia or generalized anxiety disorder, and that's actually
359760	364480	one of the downfalls of the current field of counseling, in my opinion, is, you know, the
364480	371200	overdiagnoses of these diseases. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. You said it, and again, I don't know the,
371200	376000	I'm going to misfire on the exact quote, but you once said that in all of his time counseling,
376000	381360	around something like 60% of the patients he ever saw were never dealing with an actual
381360	386240	psychological disorder, but they were dealing with, and John, this is where you come in, a crisis of
386240	395520	meaning. Yes, yes, yes. And, you know, your work has been so influential in what I want to do when I
395520	401760	hopefully knock on wood, right? Either I work with a group or I open up my own practice one day,
401760	409840	I want to create really this psychotherapeutic model that invites the individual to think more
409840	417120	deeply about virtue, and that's one thing that I really think plagues so many people. It's like,
417120	426720	if you could just realize, right, how virtues can be, virtue cultivation, how virtue cultivation
426720	437520	be so profound and have such a reformational, such a reformational influence on your life,
437520	442640	if you pursue these virtues, I believe that a lot of what people are coming in for, if those
442640	447760	individuals are not suffering from a particular disorder that you could diagnose via the DSM,
447760	456000	I do believe that something like virtue cultivation could be a serious modality to really help, you
456000	462880	know what, I'm trying to think what's the word that Aristotle uses in eudaimonia, to get to this
462880	466640	eudaimonic state, right? And that's really the goal of all mental health counseling is you want
466640	471360	the individual to reach this eudaimonic state, you want the individual to be happy, right?
472480	480080	And I won't get into like the happiness that is more, well, it's the more profound, it's more
480080	484640	joyful than it is happy, right? Eudaimonic, you want people to be joyful, and yeah, I do believe
484640	489040	that one way that we can reach joy is by the cultivation of virtues, and so yes, your work,
489680	493680	I think in a lot of what you've been doing with the Beaning Crisis and what you've been doing
493680	499680	with After Sacrities and what you're doing in general is really in alignment with what I'm doing
499680	505680	and I would hope to use your work and to pick your brain a lot, you know, now and in the future
505680	513040	to help me with this effort. Wow, that's a very well-explicated and thoughtful answer.
513840	520160	There's a lot in there. So I'm going to ask a question and it might sound like a challenge,
520160	527840	but I honestly, it's not. So one thing that's happened in response to, and I agree with all the
527840	535840	stats you were laying out, you know, the particulars might be move around a bit. I think the general
535840	542160	point I think is well stated. So one of the ways in which there's been a response, and I know people
542160	550480	that do this like Rick, Rick Rapetti, they've taken up philosophical counseling as a way of trying to
551680	556720	address the people that are coming in not because, I mean the slogan is they're not pathological,
556720	563280	they're confused and they're not sick. They're finding that they're being too foolish in their life
564160	571200	and those are not the same thing. And of course, there's nothing that prevents them from both
571200	575920	being comorbid either. Often you can have both and they're making each other worse
576480	584320	in really obnoxious fashion for the person. So are you planning on getting any training
584320	588560	in and incorporating the philosophical counseling into what you're doing because it sounds like
588560	593360	it would also be helpful for you? Yeah, no, I've most definitely looked into it
594080	601920	and I think it would be helpful. And I've already been tapped on the shoulder by a few to pursue
601920	610000	things like, you know, become maybe like a union analyst or to, like you said, maybe journey down
610000	614240	that avenue of what we would consider philosophical counseling. And I'm sure many people who are
614240	618240	watching don't even realize that there might be like this very specific type of counseling. Yes,
618240	624960	it is. Usually the individual who is the counselor usually has a higher degree in philosophy.
624960	631360	Yes. And it's almost like this, you know, I always think, I tell people, many people this
631360	636400	before, you know, I think the greatest counseling relationship that we've ever seen in human history
636960	642320	has been the counseling relationship between Virgil and John today. I really can't believe that
642320	652000	that is quite frankly the most beautiful vision of what a counselor should be. It's like, hey,
652000	659440	I'm going to help you get here. Realize, though, that I can't go with you to that. I can't get to
659440	666080	that same place that we need you to get. But I know that you need to get there. And I have to leave
666080	669760	you behind. And it's going to be sad, right? When we terminate, that's like the counselor,
670320	675680	counselor, when we terminate our relationship, it will be sad. And we have learned a lot from
675680	680720	each other, and we may not ever see each other again. But, you know, realize that again,
680720	686960	this relationship has been reformational, that it's like this beautiful, like,
686960	691360	vocation that we have journeyed on together. But to answer your question more directly,
691360	697440	yes, I have thought about pursuing it. But here's my only issue with that. I want Mike,
697440	700640	I was talking, so it's actually funny, because I was actually approaching this question with my
700640	706480	wife, literally last week, and I was like, hey, because, you know, it's all about the
706480	709680	particularities. It's like, okay, well, there's some very practical things that we have to do,
709680	712640	right? So like, I'm going to open up my own business. So you got to take out a small business
712640	717280	loan and yada, yada, yada. So it actually does, you know, this is, it's not just a me decision,
717280	721680	it's a family decision. And how is this going to affect my wife and my kid and all these things
721760	731200	that we were talking. And my vision has always been working with very high insight in individuals
731200	736000	with high insight, right? So individuals who possess high insight. And when you do philosophical
736000	740960	counseling, you're usually working with individuals with high insight, because who is going to a
740960	746560	philosophical counselor, other than that, other than the individual who has probably is somewhat
746560	754240	learned in, you know, Western, more than likely, Western continental philosophy, right?
754240	759920	And so I was telling her this. And, you know, she said, you know, very wise, she said, well,
759920	764000	you're really just missing the mark then, at that point. I was like, what does that mean?
764640	771600	She said, Joe, you know, you virtue cultivation is not just for the intelligentsia. It's not
771600	777680	just for those in an academic side, right? Virtue cultivation sometimes is needed more
778240	784560	by the individual who don't, who doesn't realize that you cultivate virtues. I mean,
784560	789360	people don't even know if we were to go out on the, our respective cities sidewalks,
789360	795200	we say, what's virtue? Who the hell would be able to, I mean, really, I have a hard time
795200	798720	myself answering that without the help of great thinkers, right? Like,
799680	806640	so, I mean, so it's not even like my, so I even sometimes have a difficult time buying the correct
806640	812400	language that I have to rely on great thinkers of the past. So given that, I mean, stemming from
812400	819040	that, who realizes that we have to cultivate it? People just think, Oh, this is, people have a
819040	826000	very odd relationship with virtue, because they just, they just don't understand that it's a
826080	832320	vocational call, right? That virtue, I believe that virtue truly operates in the beautiful. It's
832320	838560	like, the beautiful is the car and virtue are the parts of the car. So they're very connected,
838560	842720	but you can also make the distinction, right? So I'm not going to say my steering wheel is my car,
842720	847360	but I will say, like, yeah, beauty is the car. And I do believe that virtue is the steering wheel,
847360	852160	because they function similarly, right? Because the beauty and things that are beautiful,
853120	857440	allow the individual, it's like one of the only things in our life that allows us
858880	865760	to not be content with how things are, right? So it's like, we are not content with our lives,
866560	872640	and, you know, philosophically, but even like, put that on like a lower rung of the scale,
872640	880080	maybe I look at my bedroom and it's a mess and I'm like, why? So beauty really orients us
880880	887680	towards the good, right? But it also allows us not to be content. And it calls us, right? Beauty
887680	896400	calls us to achieve or go up a rung of understanding and seeing reality more vividly. And that's what
896400	901360	virtue does too. So this is why I really do believe that- Yeah, I agree. That's a very platonic argument
901360	907120	you just made. Very platonic. That's a very platonic argument you just made. Yeah. Right, exactly.
907680	915040	And, you know, I do believe that, you know, Henri de Lubach, Ray, talks about a saturated
915040	921360	phenomena. And I do believe that, I believe that virtue is also operating as a saturated phenomena.
922400	928800	Again, I do believe that virtue, again, being connected with beauty operates in the erotic,
928800	935120	because it's something that calls, it's something that pulls you. It's something that is insightful.
935120	941120	And, you know, I once read this great book, I don't know if, I mean, knowing that you have
941120	947360	spent much time studying Buddhist philosophy, I read this great book in college once upon a time,
947360	951360	because I also, I was a religious studies major, but most of my time was never actually spending,
952480	957200	well, I was never taking Christian classes, I was taking Buddhist classes. And I read this book
957200	962000	called Alone with Others by Stephen Batchelor. Yeah, yeah, I teach that book. Oh, do you? Okay,
962000	965920	yeah. I taught that book for years. I've met Stephen and had dinner with him. Yeah.
966720	973040	It's a great book. And I also, and again, it's not nothing, it's nothing about the book, by the
973040	979600	way, is about, you know, it's mostly on, you know, Buddhist, a particular Buddhist philosopher,
979600	984400	a Buddhist philosopher's connection with Martin Heidegger. But the book is called Alone with Others.
984400	991760	And that's another way I think that virtue is that virtue functions is that it's an individual
991760	998880	pursuit, but you aren't going to realize it unless it's practiced with others, right? So.
999840	1008320	So let me make sure I'm not losing the thread here. So you're, you took a look at philosophical
1008320	1013440	counseling, and there was an appeal there, but your wife said something very insightful about
1014000	1018720	what, you know, maybe the what you're called to is to bring virtue to people who are not
1018720	1024160	awakened to the quest for virtue. And you want to learn how to awaken them. And one of the functions
1024160	1031840	of beauty is to awaken them to the quest. And then, and, and, and, and this, yeah, and beauty is
1031840	1036960	one of virtue is one of these alone with others. We, you know, it's a virtue if you have Gaiji's
1036960	1041680	ring and you're alone, but it's because you're responsible to other people. I get all that
1041680	1048160	connection. And that was very eloquent. So how does this beautification, how would the beautification
1048240	1054560	and the awakening to virtue come into sort of the psychotherapeutic practice? Now, first of all,
1054560	1059040	I give you the caveat. Like if somebody, if somebody's coming in disordered pathological,
1059040	1063200	that, that has to be, that's exigent. That has to be addressed and dealt with. We're talking about
1063200	1067760	this other group, the people that are coming in existentially confused, meaning crisis. So
1069200	1075920	tell me what, how you're like, how you're, this is where a lot of my thoughts are,
1075920	1081520	I'm ruminating on most of these. So if my answer isn't as developed, please, you know, show me some
1081520	1088720	compassion, but I'll, I'll, I'll, of course, of course, of course. I was in my own. So I see, you
1088720	1094960	know, part of my program is that, and I think every good counselor, every good psychotherapist
1094960	1100240	should see their own psychotherapy. Oh, totally. Totally. I, I, I'm very critical of people who
1100240	1105600	practice, who have never gone through therapy. Right. It's odd. Um, it's like being a priest,
1105600	1113120	but never going to mass. Yeah. And it's funny. I mean, I don't, I don't really mean to
1114960	1119920	make this very direct joke, but as a Catholic, right? Sorry. One thing I struggle with, I think
1119920	1125840	I would struggle with this without, without being Catholic or not, but I have a lot of guilt,
1125840	1132640	right? That's one thing that I have in me. And I don't, and I work, get into my,
1132640	1137680	getting into my, my particular sessions, I'm trying to figure out, I'm on my own quest right now,
1138560	1144560	of figuring out if this guilt is a personality trait, where this guilt comes from, why do I have
1144560	1150960	this guilt? And it's also yesterday, I had a great, I had a great realization, but it was also very
1151040	1159600	embarrassing realization that, you know, a lot of my identity, a lot of, a lot of my identity that I
1159600	1165280	exude is still the identity that I had, you know, when I was in middle school. And that's very
1165280	1170160	embarrassing, right? But it's like, it's like, it's like these characteristics, these personal,
1170160	1175200	personality characteristics that I obviously just haven't processed correctly. Right. And they, and
1175680	1182480	they're not bad, and they don't necessarily get in the way, but they make me for a lot of reasons
1182480	1186960	without getting into my psychology, right? They, I have a lot of guilt, like I said, so I feel guilty
1186960	1191760	for, why am I telling you this? Well, I'm telling you this because I think with people of high insight
1191760	1195520	who would come in for this particular type of counseling, maybe something that they would
1195520	1202640	also feel ashamed or guilt. And so usually high insightful people will do something, something
1202640	1210480	very menial, right? Could be menial. Like I lied to my spouse about, I don't know. I mean, maybe
1210480	1218400	I lied about how many beers I had at the party, or I don't know, maybe, maybe I, maybe I watched
1218400	1224320	pornography and I feel really bad about that. Maybe I bullied a friend, I jibbed a friend a
1224320	1229040	little too hard, you know, when we were, you know, in our, in our group text message, or, and you
1229040	1238080	could think of whatever, you know, I feel guilt. Okay. And then, you know, unfortunately, nowadays,
1238080	1243600	I mean, how everyone who feels guilt, like four times in a week, or am I a narcissist? Am I this?
1243600	1249120	Am I, no, no, no, let's, let's, let's take deep breath and let's, let's take this. What if it's
1249120	1258000	not guilt? What if it's not shame that you're experiencing? What if, again, because like virtue
1258000	1264640	is a call, right? It's something that calls you. So what if virtue was a call? And what if the fact
1264640	1270960	that you were able to admit to me that you lied to your wife, or you did something dishonest,
1270960	1278880	you did something that wasn't courageous, you did something, you know, you did, you did something
1278880	1283120	again, you just didn't enjoy the fact that you're able to sit here in a counseling session and tell
1283120	1290000	me that you have guilt and that you didn't enjoy it. Maybe that's not guilt at all. And maybe
1290000	1295600	that's your conscious telling you, or maybe that's virtue, right, trying to signal to you
1296320	1303040	that you should pursue this further. The fact that you were able to feel that the fact that you
1303040	1308320	knew that it was wrong to lie, the fact that it was the fact that, you know, you were being
1308400	1314720	deceptive, that you were being surreptitious. That insight right there might allow you to
1314720	1321920	realize that, no, no, I don't need to feel guilty, but the fact that I was cognizant of my fault,
1323200	1329920	maybe that's actually virtue communicating with me and inviting me to indulge in a deeper
1329920	1336720	relationship with virtue. Well, I see. I see. So you're reframing it. It's very
1336800	1342320	high agarient, which Stephen would love, Stephen Bachelor. Yeah. You know, the conscience is,
1343760	1347680	there's an existential version of conscience. There's a psychological version of conscience,
1347680	1353520	which is basically your internalization of certain norms. And you punish yourself as a way of
1353520	1357760	redirecting your behavior, guilt and shame. They're not the same thing, but they're sort of working.
1358400	1365840	But then there's an existential sense where conscience is the call to authenticity. You're
1365840	1372080	saying conscience could be understood as the call to virtue. So where does the beauty come in? Is
1372080	1379920	that trying to see the beauty of the life that you could be called to? Is that the idea? Yeah,
1379920	1390160	that's precisely it. And even trying to, you know, again, like, I think if you pursue and
1391120	1397040	try to cultivate and therefore try to live a virtuous life, I do think, yeah, in that process,
1397040	1401760	I mean, life automatically becomes more beautiful, right? So what's a more beautiful vision of life
1401760	1407360	that I'll complete as hard as it could be a complete honest relationship with your wife or
1407360	1411280	dishonest relationship with your wife? And what's more beautiful, right? What's a higher form of
1411280	1416880	that? Right. So yeah. So yes, what you said precisely. Oh, that's very interesting.
1417520	1423680	So like, yeah, I could see how a lot of the work that I do would be relevant to that project.
1424320	1433840	And so how does, you know, the truth, the truth of the beautiful David Chindler,
1433840	1438880	who I get to talk to, you know, these are the transcendentals. They're the transcendentals
1438880	1445520	because they apply universally across domains. But the idea is their ultimate unity is in
1446160	1454880	is in the one or God, your Catholic, so I'll say God for your benefit. How does that sense of the
1454880	1460880	transcendence, you know, Plato, the symposium, the cult of the love of virtue is not the final love,
1460880	1467680	we move beyond that to the love of the source of intelligibility or the possibility of virtue,
1470000	1473600	the ground of being, the ground of life, the ground of wisdom, that sort of
1474560	1482320	vision that's articulated in Aquinas or Maximus. How does, so now given all of that sort of
1483440	1486880	explication, how does God show up in this for you? Yeah, I mean,
1488560	1494160	you're Catholic, so it's fair to re-ask that question, I think. 100% it's fair. So again, like,
1495760	1499760	this is why I bring up, this is why I say that Dante and Virgil is such a good model.
1500640	1504400	It's, you know, in a counseling session, I don't know if I would, I mean,
1504400	1510960	unless the individual is comfortable with bringing it up, you know, then I would talk about God, but
1512400	1517760	yeah, well, you, I mean, you almost, I think and challenge me and push me further, but I really
1517760	1522080	almost think that, you know, you gave the answer in your question though. And when it's, you know,
1523040	1530480	all these things are in submission to the one, right? Virtue and beauty and the true and the good.
1530480	1535440	And I don't, you know what, I'm having a hard time trying to order three transcendentals in my own
1535440	1540000	life. I would love to get your take on that. It's like, you know, what's, it's like, what's, you
1540000	1544560	know, everyone tries to say, oh, you pursue the good and that opens up the beautiful and that
1544560	1551040	gives you truth. I don't necessarily think that it matters how you orient the three transcendentals
1551040	1557680	for me personally. I believe, like I said, that beauty is the most approachable because, yeah,
1557680	1562080	that's what Plato thought, because beauty is the one that reaches so readily and obviously into the
1562080	1569360	sensual aspect of our being in the way that truth and goodness don't. We can see and touch beauty
1569360	1575600	in a way in which we can see and not, we cannot see and cannot touch truth and goodness. So I think
1576560	1581440	David Gendo talks about it as, what is it? I might get it wrong, but something like the primacy
1581440	1589120	of beauty, it comes first, but the centrality of truth and then I think the ultimacy of goodness,
1589120	1593840	or it could be those two the other way around, but they each have a superlative, but in different
1593840	1604480	ways. I think, I think speaking temporally, I think beauty comes first. I saw, but what we have to
1604480	1609760	remember is to not, and human beings have a proclivity to this, this error. We have, we shouldn't
1609760	1614800	confuse, that's what David's trying to address. We shouldn't confuse temporal priority with
1614800	1620320	ontological priority. Just because beauty comes first doesn't mean it's the first of the transcendentals,
1621360	1629680	right? They're all first in different ways. Beauty is temporally first. I think the true is
1630240	1636080	central in some way, but they have different priorities. And I, like I say, kind of remember
1636080	1643840	which way David does it. It's really good. His work on that on, on the primacy of beauty,
1643840	1651760	and then he talks about primacy, centrality, and ultimacy. And so I think truth is the ultimate
1651760	1656560	actually, and goodness is the, is the central, but I could, I could have a look around. But that's
1656560	1662480	because I have a slightly different notion of goodness is perhaps making me confused. So I'm
1662480	1668000	just admitting I'm confused. But the point, the point that I'm not confused about that I think
1668000	1674880	is well taken is to not, is to recognize that each transcendental is ultimate, but in a different
1674880	1679760	way. Each, right? So there's, there's firstness and there's centrality and there's ultimacy.
1680400	1686320	These are all superlatives, but in fundamental different ways. And just don't, so learn to
1686560	1692160	differentiate the different ways in which they're ultimate, but also learn to not confuse them
1693360	1699520	and give each one its proper due. It's profound. Yeah. And I, you know, just because of my background,
1700080	1708480	you know, I, my, my undergraduate degree is in art history and religious studies. My master's work
1708480	1713840	is working with my favorite Catholic theologian, Von Balthasar. So obviously,
1714160	1722480	yeah, you've got to read some Schindler. He is the person that has made Balthasar
1723120	1730480	like accessible and I think clearer. And also he's developed. David's just done amazing work
1730480	1736800	developing beyond Von. And I mean that in the way a good student goes beyond their teacher,
1736800	1742880	but he's gone beyond Balthasar in just profound ways. Of course. Oh, this is great. Okay. This
1742880	1748800	is great. I need, oh man. Okay. Yeah. Well, now I have something to do. I do want to say one thing
1748800	1752080	though, back to your question about, you know, where is the one and where does God come in an
1752080	1761280	office? Yes, please. This makes me a bad Catholic. I'm sure. And I'm, I'm worried about, sometimes
1761280	1767600	like, yeah, I always have a hard time. I always have a hard time trying to know, or I have a hard
1767600	1775440	time knowing where I fit in in these circles. I watched that video that you and Paul Bander Clay
1775440	1780240	and Jonathan Peugeot, and forgive me, I don't remember the woman's name. I had, that was the
1780240	1785280	first time I interacted with her virtually. What was her, what's her name? Who's on? You did,
1785280	1792400	I'm sorry, let me give you the title first. On a Spiritual Home, it was on. Oh, that's Catherine.
1792480	1799280	Sure. Yeah. And there was John Van Dink was there as well. Yes. Wonderful. Well, it's kind of funny
1799280	1804000	because, you know, as someone, I mean, obviously as someone who's Catholic, I still somewhat don't
1804000	1808240	feel that I have a spiritual home. And the reason why I preface this is this. In my counseling,
1808240	1816560	like, you know, my goal is never to make in life. In life, this is very hard to admit. I'm not
1816560	1821440	necessarily concerned with converting people to Catholicism. I don't think you should be when
1821440	1827840	you're in therapy. I think that's just, I think that's just. Even personally, I'm not necessarily,
1827840	1833360	you know, and I, and that's for my own personal reasons. And that's because, you know, I'm basically
1833360	1839280	not, I mean, I'm a cradle Catholic, but I'm also a revert. And I had, you know, a long bout with
1839280	1846000	atheism. And I, as I just expressed to you, I mostly studied Buddhist philosophy and undergrad,
1846000	1854880	and deep, deep compassion for anyone who has that proclivity. And so it's not my goal to make
1854880	1861280	any one Catholic, but it is my goal to, and I'm not a relativist, I want to make that very, very,
1861280	1872320	very. It is my goal, though, to unite the individual with the one God, right. And I won't
1872320	1877440	necessarily get into the, yeah, I don't understand what I just said was loaded, because then you
1877440	1882800	can, again, you can, oh, what is he saying that, you know, what he's, what he's saying is that
1882800	1888720	like a relative, relativist thought, and I don't necessarily want to get into my, my spirituality,
1889920	1895760	or, you know, things that I subscribe to, I really enjoy the more mystical teachings of Catholicism.
1895760	1902800	But yeah, it's never my goal to make anyone anything. My goal is the only, the only goal I
1902800	1909200	have is, like I stated before, is to help the individual pursue the path to eudaimonia, right.
1909200	1915440	And that's what I want to do. So I think that's a good clarification and specification. So let me
1915440	1921680	make my question more precise than my question is, well, I first of all, proposal, I propose that
1922480	1933600	getting people into right orientation towards the one towards ultimacy is how you can best help them
1934880	1940240	explicate, articulate, and respond to their, and here I'm being till it, their ultimate concerns,
1940240	1947360	and that part of what is underneath their confusion is very often they are confused about
1947360	1952560	what they ultimately care about. That's one part of the confusion. The other can be what is ultimate
1952560	1957520	such that I should care about it as ultimate is another thing that people are often confused
1957520	1962160	about. We often pursue evil, not because we're pursuing evil, but because we pursue a lesser
1962160	1968160	good at the expense of a greater good. Oh, amen. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So what I, what I meant was,
1968160	1972960	you know, how, yes, I get it, you're not proselytizing, you're not trying to surreptitiously convert
1972960	1978240	people. That would be duplicitous. I think it would be vicious in fact. But there's a sense in
1978240	1982880	which if what we're talking about, again, not, not the pathological people, but the deeply confused
1982880	1988240	people, we're trying to bring them clarity, then I think the orientation towards, you know, what's
1988240	1994720	real, what's most real, and how well connected am I to it is a fundamental question about meaning
1994720	1999440	in life. Of course. And that's where you're, I mean, and that's exactly where your specific
1999440	2005120	project comes in. And it's like, okay, but now how do I make this a psychological modality?
2005120	2009040	Right. I don't sit them down. Hey, in today's session, we're going to watch episode four of
2009040	2015520	the meeting. Of course. That would be utterly ridiculous. That sounds like a weird sitcom to
2015520	2022000	that could be done or something. Yeah. Right. Um, but it's again, it's like, yeah, how do I
2022640	2028880	distill? And again, I'm not, and you know this, you are not the only individual who has written
2028960	2036560	or thought about this extensively, right? So it's not just you. It's, it's, it's you in
2038480	2043360	accompaniment with other great thinkers. It's you in accompaniment with spiritual teachers. It's
2043360	2050720	you in accompaniment with simply just like already like empirically proven psychotherapeutic
2050720	2057120	practices, right? So it's like, and it's also in company with my, with my own, uh, with, with,
2057120	2064320	with who I am as a person, right? Yeah. So it's like, how do I put it? How do I, how do I get all,
2064320	2069680	all of us to converge? How do I, how do I create this tapestry of all these voices?
2069680	2074240	And that's what's difficult because it can't just be, right? So this is the thing. I mean,
2074240	2079360	counseling is not what we are seeing on YouTube, right? This is not, I mean, this is, this, this,
2079360	2084480	in a way, this is nice. Um, and I've had many counseling sessions where it has just been a
2084480	2091760	dialogue. Um, but how do we transform the dialogue? Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so that's the question
2091760	2096160	that I'm, I'm, I'm struggling with quite frankly. I mean, so again, there's more skin in the game
2096160	2101200	because this is not just a theoretical, I'm not just like having this conversation with you,
2101200	2106000	just a, you know, kill an hour. It's like, no, this is quite frankly, like a livelihood that I
2106000	2112080	might have. Right. This is, this is also, this has economic implications, right? Yeah. I get it.
2112080	2116160	So it's like, well, what's the model that, what, what's the model? And so yeah, this is the thing
2116160	2121920	that I'm, I'm, I'm tirelessly thinking about every day. And it's like, yeah, I'm breathing a lot,
2121920	2125840	and I'm thinking a lot, and I'm reflecting a lot, and I'm watching a lot.
2126800	2130640	I want to know this when, when, like, I, I'm not demanding it now. I get it. It's a
2130640	2136720	work in progress. So, so, but, so don't mistake my, but like, I want, I like, I want to, I,
2137680	2142320	I want notes from the front or something. I want to know, like, how this is work,
2142320	2147200	how you are doing that, how you're translating that into, this is very important. I mean,
2149760	2152960	I mean, part of what the Verveki Foundation is trying to do is collect,
2154080	2158800	you know, relevant psychotherapists and counselors and philosophical counselors who can deal with
2158800	2164160	people who are wrestling with not just sort of the pedagogical struggles of taking on
2164160	2170480	an ecology practices, but, you know, a therapeutic slash existential dimension. So, you know,
2170480	2174960	let me interrupt you right there, even. So, I mean, part of it is also just not trying to reinvent
2174960	2180960	the wheel. Right. Yeah. We have, I mean, who the hell am I? Not, not that much, right? Who the hell
2180960	2188880	am I to say I'm going to create this new psychotherapeutic model, right? No. How am I going to have,
2189200	2195040	how am I, how am I going to personally put my ego aside for a second? And I'm going to submit
2195040	2202720	myself to the great thinkers, to visionaries of the past. And I, again, I, I interact with them,
2203520	2207840	and I transcend time and space, and they come into that session. So it's like, yeah, it's like,
2207840	2215200	how do we, okay, so part of it is I'm wrestling with kind of this hybrid CBT existential model,
2215200	2220480	because there is, because there, there, you do need to involve some type of cognitive behavioral
2220480	2227120	therapy. And of course, people reframing abilities, you have to. Exactly. Because you can give everyone
2227120	2232000	the existential jargon, and someone's going to say, you know, you, you can talk about, you know,
2232000	2237200	like I said, use I, you just throw out, like it's like a word box, like, oh yeah, I the relationship,
2237200	2244960	or yeah, whatever, like, you can't do that unless you have to first get the individual to a
2244960	2249200	place of insight, they weren't there. It wasn't there before, right? And the only way you can get
2249200	2258560	there is through the, you know, and we should be, we should be in, we should have much gratitude
2258560	2265200	towards the individuals who really developed the CBT model. And I do believe, you know, one thing,
2265200	2270240	it's funny, I talked about never knowing where my footing is, it's like, I, yeah, I tend to,
2271120	2278560	in the psychological circles, I tend to hang out with the more existential psychologists,
2278560	2284240	right? There's a lot of like good existential psychology happening right now. Even from,
2284880	2294320	you know, my institution where I'm at, Clay Rutledge over at Dakota, he's doing a lot of great work in
2294400	2302400	terror management and nostalgia and just more existential things that you could actually trickle
2302400	2309360	down to using that as like a therapeutic modality. But, so what I'm getting at is that you have the
2309360	2315280	existentialists on one side and just being like, sometimes it's weird how we just like groupthink,
2315280	2320240	they're like, no, this, you know, the people who subscribe to CBT, that's just a bunch of bullshit.
2320240	2325440	It's like, no, it's not just a bunch, I mean, it can't be a bunch of bullshit. It's not just that,
2325440	2331120	it's not that simplistic. And the evidence is the effectiveness of CBT is going down,
2331120	2337760	because as it's been abstracted and extracted from therapists who had a much broader philosophical
2337760	2343040	base and could bring in and address existential issues and sapiential having to do with wisdom
2343040	2347760	and virtue issues. Yeah, when you take it out, you abstract it, you just have it as a separate
2347760	2353440	method. Like it looks like it's effectiveness as an evidence-based therapy is actually going down.
2354800	2359920	There's a lot of reasons for that. And just like the, yeah, like, it's unfortunate how much
2360720	2367840	your basic, sorry, your average clinician who is working in the modality of CBT
2368880	2375760	might not actually have a keen of an eye. And they might not understand CBT. So what ends up
2375760	2380000	happening is you just, you go back to third grade vocab class and you just get a work.
2381600	2389200	I have a stronger critique. I think, yeah, yeah, it's, I think the way to address this
2390160	2396240	is that CBT and other people have said this, Robinson and others, CBT needs to be resituated
2396240	2405280	into, inside stoicism, which it was derived, because what needs to be offered is not a technique,
2405280	2410160	but the cultivation of virtue within the aspiration to a good life. And that's what's
2410160	2417280	missing from CBT as a framework right now. So I think CBT was more effective. You know, the people
2417280	2424800	who invented it were deeply educated with stoicism, right? And then that has fallen away
2425600	2429600	because of psychology's proclivity to forget its philosophical past.
2429600	2434880	Oh, amen. And that's why I said, that's why, you know, to get to the point or to get to the
2434880	2443280	genesis of this subconversation. Yeah, you have to bring in the existential psychotherapeutic
2443280	2450000	techniques are the most approachable of, you know, that side of the coin. So you do need to have this
2450000	2457040	blend of, you know, cog and existentialism. And you need to blend these two together. And I think
2457440	2466960	I personally think if this, if this enmeshing happens, then this is, then we can borrow that
2467840	2471840	and use that for this vision of counseling that I've been discussing.
2471840	2480720	Interesting, interesting. So I mean, virtues often have to do with two other things, emotions. So
2481200	2487760	I mean, I've done training also in EFT, Emotional Public Policy, and also inter-conflict and
2488320	2494720	inter-parts work by GIFS and other things are really good for learning how to also internalize
2494720	2500720	the dialogue inside the psyche and not always make it. So I'm wondering, do you think those
2500720	2506240	other two, I mean, I don't want to send you on an education. By the way, Joe, just, you know,
2507200	2513280	get educated on this for the next 20 years and then, but it seems to me, I guess I'm making an
2513280	2519440	argument. I agree totally with the proposal of integrating CBT and existentialism and therefore
2519440	2527040	getting something back to something like stoicism. But we also know, you know, stoicism and should
2527040	2532880	be put into dialogue with Buddhism because all kinds of evidence that combining CBT and
2532880	2539440	mindfulness together is synergistically helpful. Right. So I'm just wondering, like, is it, you
2539440	2544160	know, and then you want the inner dialogue work to overcome inner conflict and how to internalize
2544160	2550480	dialogue and IFS is good for that. And then dealing with emotions is a very, very important
2550480	2554720	part of call to virtue. I mean, Aristotle said, you know, it's not about being angry or not,
2554720	2558800	it's being angry at the right time for the right reasons to the right degree for the right person.
2559600	2565680	Yeah. And this is where, you know, a lot, you know, I'm even thinking about now and forgive
2565680	2569760	me if I don't directly answer your question, but now I'm just, you know, brainstorming and just,
2569760	2573600	again, they're not, they're not, again, please have compassion for me because they're not the
2573600	2577280	most, they're not developed thoughts yet because I'm spending a lot of my time thinking about this.
2577280	2584640	And so it's been like, you know, how, to what effect will, to what effect does psycho education
2584720	2593440	even have, like this type of therapy? It's like, you know, you said, I forget exactly,
2595200	2599440	I know you talked about mindfulness, but even just like the differentiation between teaching
2599440	2605360	someone what's the difference, the difference between mindfulness and contemplation meditation.
2605360	2609840	Meditation, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. So it's like, how often do we conflate these and we conflate
2609840	2614960	these and then we think that, and it's just confused. So if we don't understand the meaning
2614960	2620480	of words that we use, well, then we have, we don't understand our very selves because like,
2620480	2625680	the person is like a word. I mean, we are like letters. I mean, it's all these things are connected,
2625680	2632640	right? My friend Spencer Clayton, he writes about this in his newest book. And he talks about how
2634080	2639440	one thing that's been lost is the meaning of the meaning of words, right? I mean,
2640240	2643520	structuralists. So, you know, we think that words can mean whatever the hell they want,
2643520	2649920	but it's like, no, like these, these things, these symbols engender something, right? And,
2650560	2657200	and once we believe that they don't, well, then we get in a weird, really weird place. And, okay,
2657200	2664080	so how are we like letters then? Or how are we like words? Like, well, our forms engender something.
2664080	2669360	And if we believe that they don't engender something real or true, or how about this,
2669360	2676240	that we all engender possibly the same thing, getting back to the notion of the one to God.
2676240	2681120	But when we stop believing this, we get into really weird places. And it's so funny that you
2681120	2688880	brought up stoicism because I was thinking about how, you know, the Stoics naturally, and again,
2688960	2693920	even with the Buddhists, right? So the Stoics, what's, you know, you take a Stoic and you can
2693920	2700000	naturally start ushering them into the Christian ethic, right? It's so, it's, it's, it's a, it's
2700000	2705040	not easy, but you know, you do it via Neil Platonism. That's how you do it. Right. And so,
2706640	2711840	yeah, I mean, so, because, because in stoicism, it's obviously, I mean, people nowadays,
2711840	2715120	especially individuals who might be going to counseling, who aren't necessarily religious,
2715120	2720880	right? Taking those more Stoic practice, people are going to, people are going to automatically
2720880	2728240	feel more comfortable. Yes, very much. Yeah. Rather than if they begin to sniff that,
2728240	2733200	oh, what you're saying, I remember kind of hearing a very watered down version of that sometime in,
2733200	2741280	like, in Christian school, or that's mildly religious. Right. So, yeah, I, it's, yes, it's,
2741280	2747120	it's trying to be as approachable as possible. But no, you, when you were talking about, you know,
2747120	2752720	the regulations of emotions and trying to figure out, I mean, yes, that, I think that that very
2752720	2759600	much so is going to be a big part of this. Again, it's just like, and I, and part of this conversation,
2759600	2764800	which I didn't necessarily expect it to be, but I'm really happy it isn't, it's trying, it's trying
2764800	2771920	to talk with, you know, individuals. I mean, so I'm also talking next Thursday on a busy schedule.
2771920	2776960	Her name is Nancy Snow. I don't know if you're familiar with her work. Nancy Snow? No, sorry.
2777760	2781840	No, it's fine. And so I wasn't that familiar with her work either until just due my own
2781840	2786080	perspective. So Nancy Snow is now at the University of Kansas, but she previously was at the University
2786080	2793120	of Oklahoma. And so from 2000, from 2015 to 2018, Nancy in collaboration with
2794000	2800480	other academics in the psychological field, they held experience, experiments just on, like,
2800480	2807040	on this topic of virtue cultivation, how to, yeah, how to, and I'm so sorry, I don't have the exact
2807040	2813760	name, but you should look her up after this is Nancy, Nancy Snow. And what their goal was in
2813760	2824320	this three-year project was to discuss how you can use virtue cultivation. Can we make this,
2824320	2828560	can we give this like some empirical backing, right? Because no one in the psychological field
2828560	2832880	is going to care if you don't have empirical backing. Yeah. So yeah, part of it is having
2832880	2840560	conversations like with you next week, Professor Snow. And hopefully what I end up doing is
2840720	2847760	I, I take all these voices and I, like I said, I put everyone into accompaniment.
2849440	2854480	And, you know, maybe we'll talk in the future. I don't know. But I'd like to, I'd like to know when,
2855120	2860160	when you find your voice from all of these voices, I'd like to know what that was like,
2860160	2868160	and what, how you did it, and what is properly idiosyncratic to you and what is properly
2868160	2870800	charitable with other people. Yeah, it's very much like to know that.
2872800	2876880	Yeah. So we're, we're on the journey together, I guess, you know, we're, and that's, and that's
2876880	2886080	the really beautiful thing. So yeah, you know, and, you know, I did it. I, this, I'm kind of like,
2886080	2891520	you know, going off the path a little bit. I didn't want to ask you a question though that I've
2891520	2896880	been thinking about. I was just going to say, I think we should turn things over to you now asking
2896960	2905200	me questions. Okay, let's do that. Okay. So how about this? We'll probably stay on this path.
2905200	2910000	Well, I have a couple of questions I'm going to ask you about virtue and about play and about
2910000	2915040	male and female virtue. And I'm going to incorporate Jung in that. I'm going to incorporate play in that.
2915040	2921040	So I'll ask you some questions. But we're still going to be on the same. Yeah, if that's okay.
2922000	2926400	With all that being said, real quick, just to, just to answer the question,
2926400	2931840	what would you say is the gist of your intellectual project? Because you do so much.
2934880	2937280	What are you trying to, what are you really trying to,
2939200	2943280	what are you trying to achieve? What do you want people to take away?
2943760	2957040	I want people to recover, how to cultivate meaning in life and wisdom. So they have wise meaning
2957040	2965360	and meaningful wisdom, such that they can fall in love with beauty, truth and goodness, and
2965360	2970640	ultimately fall in love with being again, and continue to do so for the rest of their lives.
2974000	2983120	Real quick endeavor, right? I appreciate that. Thank you. And I will say, I mean, so
2986240	2989840	you're getting bigger and bigger. This is, I just thought of this question now, but you know,
2989840	2998480	and your pursuit is truly the most noble of pursuits. And your voice is being heard by many
2998480	3003280	and you're helping out a lot of people. Has that hit you yet? Is that hitting you now that you are
3003280	3009360	getting, that you, you're, you're gaining some type of what we would probably consider celebrity
3009360	3014400	status, right? You're, you're probably getting more into the public intellectual sphere, probably
3014400	3023760	that you ever thought you were ever going to get into, I'm guessing. Very, very mixed.
3024720	3032560	One part of me is deeply grateful and I take great pains to demonstrate and to
3033440	3038560	point out that there's, this is not me alone. This is very much a lot of people that I'm
3038560	3045760	collaborating with and in community with. So I'm very grateful for the recognition. I'm very grateful
3045760	3055520	for the, the collaboration. Very grateful for both of those. I'm very concerned, very concerned about
3056560	3063920	undertaking whatever, the exercise of whatever influence I garner to do it with as much
3063920	3069200	virtue and virtuosity as I can. So that's why I've set up and I've got, there's the, the
3069200	3075040	Viveki Foundation, which is a not-for-profit and there's Ryan Barton, who's the executive director
3075040	3080640	and Eric Foster from Upfire, the director of operations and there's people on the board
3081200	3087840	and so, right? And so there's, I have an arms length relationship. So the money and the recognition
3087840	3095280	is not right here. It's over there and it's, there's a lot of people who I selected very carefully,
3096240	3104000	who are very committed to a virtuous vision. And so, and I'm constantly looking for
3105680	3109920	feedback on how not to become a guru in the pejorative sense of the word.
3110480	3112480	Yeah. So that, that's hitting me.
3114000	3116240	Because unfortunately people will do that.
3116800	3118560	Oh, they will and I don't want to.
3119280	3125920	Yeah. And I really, really, really, really don't want to. I really don't want, I want,
3125920	3133600	I really am, I deeply aspire to being Socrates and I really, that is the most profound thing I want.
3134160	3142960	And I don't want anything to come at the expense of my aspiration to being as authentically
3142960	3148400	Socratic as I can. And, and in connection with that, although it doesn't sound like they're the
3148400	3153360	same thing, but they're connected, you know, all the, all the fundamental relationships that,
3154560	3165760	that I value for their own sake. So I don't want that. There's, I'm not, I'm socially phobic
3165760	3171760	by nature. This is a, this is a decade long persona that I have crafted that you're interacting
3171760	3178880	with, not inauthentically, by the way. I'm sure it aspirationally. But so I was talking to Ryan
3178880	3187840	last night about, I recently released a video on AI and the scientific and philosophical and
3187840	3193200	spiritual import of what's happening in AI right now. And it's, it's doing very well.
3193920	3203920	And, and so I get a sense of exposure that is quite unpleasant for me around that.
3207840	3214000	But, but if I hadn't done it, like I did that, I worked really, really hard,
3214800	3219360	like almost obsessively so for about three or three or four weeks before I released the video,
3219360	3224320	I say, because I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility. So it's not like I can't do
3224320	3230560	these things because of the exposure, because then I'm beset by a tremendous sense of responsibility
3230560	3235760	to the level of obligation, you know, about trying to do something, try to do whatever I can to steer
3235760	3241120	this towards the good for the sake of my family and my kids, my friends and for the world.
3241760	3248480	Yeah, right. But, but on the other hand, yeah, like, it's like, it's like, it's, it's like,
3250240	3255920	it's, it's, it's a negative affect of exposure that I also confront around it.
3257520	3264720	So techniques that you do to control your id from seeping into all of this. What do you, what do
3264720	3274240	you do to? Well, I have my, I mean, I do my daily ecology of practices, and which are do a lot about,
3274240	3279920	you know, that there's dialogical practices, imaginable mindfulness practices, you know,
3279920	3284800	body movement movement, the whole ecology, trying to design it, all the stuff I'm talking about,
3284800	3290720	designing a proper well, I enter into, you know, a dialectic into the logos, philosophical fellowship,
3290720	3295600	I do practices, I like my patrons are becoming like, we do, we do practices together, which is,
3296160	3300240	and I mean this, I mean this with respect, it's kind of like going to church together.
3301840	3308880	Yeah. And then, like I said, I know that we, we can't rely on self interpretation and self
3308880	3314160	direction, we have to engage it, but we can't rely on that for getting us to the good, we have to
3314160	3319520	make sure that there are people other than us, we nevertheless have our best interest at park,
3319520	3326560	who we have empowered, or also make it personal, who I've empowered to challenge me, to speak on me,
3326560	3332240	to keep me away from, so I don't, like for example, all the money doesn't come to me,
3332240	3337520	it goes to the Raveki Foundation, and then I will take out expenses for projects, and I also take out,
3337520	3343840	you know, a relatively small honorarium, because, you know, I should, this is a lot of my time,
3343840	3350000	and I like, I'm not generating income elsewhere that I could be doing, so it compensates for that,
3350000	3360960	but it's very much about putting in place also the external safeguards where there is specific
3360960	3366000	people who have been specifically empowered with specific duties to help keep me on track.
3366880	3372080	All of that can still screw up, but the more and more of this, I can make self organizing and
3372080	3379360	independent from my, you know, personal, my personal cognitive and emotional biases,
3380320	3386720	the better I think I can meet the demands which, and meeting the demands I do find very meaningful,
3386720	3392560	meeting the demands of doing this virtually, and with doing it virtuously and with virtuosity,
3392560	3398240	yeah, that's what I'm trying to do. That's beautiful, it's hard sometimes, you know, and
3399200	3407600	I am obviously nowhere near you, but as I, you know, I, this little podcast has allowed me to,
3407600	3415200	it's opened up doors, of course, it's allowed me to write for, you know, a publication,
3415200	3424480	it's allowed for me to have great conversations with you and other people, it's, I have, I mean,
3424480	3430320	I have my one, only one video and I don't ever want it to, because that was, I was very anxious
3430320	3435200	when I saw how many people were watching it, but one video was 40,000 views and I remember,
3436720	3440800	I was like, I remember like working out and I was at the gym and I was just clicking to see
3440800	3448720	how many people were watching it, and I was both flattered and both, I was getting egotistical
3448720	3453600	about it, but I was also extremely, I was growing extremely, you know, anxious over it,
3453680	3458640	and so it's like, in all this, you kind of, you get this false sense of gravitas, and so sometimes,
3458640	3463360	I know in my life, the people, you made that very clear and you made that beautiful point, it's like,
3463360	3469360	you know, you have the individuals, the friends, or the loved ones, the lovers, right, that, that
3469360	3476800	ground you, and it's like, well, oftentimes, now that I've been doing more, you know, sometimes that
3476800	3480960	gets, that gets into the way, that gets into the way, you know, sometimes with my relationship,
3481040	3485520	with my wife, maybe I'm working on something and, you know, my wife says, oh, look at the baby,
3487040	3492800	or, hey, you want to hang out, and it's like, well, I'm writing, or I'm collaborating, and so
3492800	3498560	that's on a teeny tiny scale, so I, you know, I can't imagine, you know, the,
3500480	3506160	how conscious you have to be, basically, on a moment-to-moment basis, which is good,
3506160	3511040	but it's also very hard in order to not deteriorate these relationships, and we don't have to get
3511040	3516000	into it by any means, I don't, I'm not asking you to- Well, I do want to say something about it,
3516000	3521040	I mean, I was, because I was talking to, I was talking to my life partner, I was talking to her
3521040	3531280	last night, and it's really interesting, I was saying how she actually becomes more and more real.
3531760	3538080	I said something to the effectist, as some of my, you know, dreams come true, I more and more find
3538080	3543200	the woman of my dreams to be more real, that's what's actually happening for me,
3545520	3552240	because the ephemerality of this, and again, please, I want to, I'm very grateful for the
3552240	3557200	recognition, I really am, and I'm not, I'm not being dismissive or insulting of it, but
3557680	3564720	sometimes, there's an old Greek proverb, that God sometimes punish us by giving us what we want,
3564720	3571920	right, and so a lot of these things that I, you know, I wanted more recognition,
3571920	3576640	I wanted my work to get out there, I wanted to make a difference, and you know, and to be really
3576640	3584080	honest, there's an egocentric, egotistical aspect to that, which- Always does. Yeah, well, I mean,
3584160	3590960	because, you know, if you totally get rid of the self-preservation strategy, you'll, you'll die,
3592400	3601200	and so, but, you know, getting a lot of the success, as you said, I didn't really expect
3601200	3606880	the gas, although I'd always wanted it, you know, that weird sort of semi-fantasy thing that we all
3606880	3616240	were, getting that fulfilled has, and I don't want to come off as being saintly, because that is not
3616240	3625760	what I am or claim it to be, but it's, it's kind of, it's, it's salience diminishes in some important
3625760	3631120	way with respect to the things that are really mattering in your life, that's what I found,
3631120	3637440	I mean, I'm not saying this is universal, but, but for me, that's been helpful, it's like, wait,
3637440	3643760	you know, all of this is really cool and everything, but what's really happening phenomenologically is
3643760	3649440	that's sort of now more background for me, and my relationship with Sara, and like, and my kids,
3649440	3657680	and like, my friends, that's not really- I really do, I mean, I've only been a dad now for
3657680	3666800	a year and a half, but this, his birth and his life has coincided with this project of mine,
3666800	3671440	and kind of my, you know, this is my second career, I was a high school teacher, and then I had my own
3671440	3678960	meeting process for a while, and I kind of, this allowed me to, it jolted me back on this path,
3678960	3684320	and part of that jolt was my son being born, and the encouragement of my wife, and, but getting into,
3685280	3690960	and connecting what you were saying, yeah, I understand that he's actually more real now
3690960	3700240	than I ever have before, and I hope that as I grow and I develop in my pursuits, that actually allows
3700240	3708640	my boy to be more vivid to me, and my wife to be more vivid to me day by day, and it's beautiful
3708640	3715600	when these things mesh, and when our, you know, intellectual pursuit allows for our personal
3715600	3722400	pursuit to become more vivid. I hope so, I mean, I, at the end of my practices, I frequently pray
3722400	3728960	a prayer that Socrates pray, he prays it initially to, it goes something along the lines, a beloved
3728960	3738640	pan and all God to dwell in this place, give me the inward beauty, inward beauty, and let the
3738640	3744160	outward man and the inward man be as one, and I probably messed that up a bit.
3746240	3756720	Right, and, and, and, like, if, like, I hope, and I try, I put effort into cultivating the discernment,
3756720	3762720	I could see how people could be tempted for the reverse, the salience of the fame and other
3762720	3769520	things could actually cause that to be foregrounded, and the real things to be backgrounded, that's
3769520	3775120	obviously happened to be, yeah, tons of rock stars, and, right, no, exactly, right, the rock star
3775120	3782880	phenomenon, there's that. And I've also, I've also seen, I've also seen
3786000	3792160	that there's a temptation, right, right, I don't want to totally use that in religious sense,
3792160	3795280	but I don't want to ignore the religious sense either, so that's why I'm hesitating, but there's
3795280	3802080	a temptation, I can feel it, wait, this fame and this, you know, this fame and this wealth,
3802160	3805280	it's not as satisfying as I thought it would be, so the answer is I should get more,
3807520	3812400	I've felt that impulse come up to me, and it comes up from this Darwinian depth, right, wait,
3812400	3818480	the answer is go higher on the hierarchy, that's surely the answer, right, and it's like, whoa,
3818480	3829680	and I've noticed that too. So I'm trying to keep, right, I'm trying to, you know, be properly,
3829680	3835680	like mindful of them, not suppress it, but also not, not obsess about it, like get that golden
3835680	3844880	mean about it, so that I can hopefully not fall prey to that temptation. I would like to be,
3846880	3853520	if I could get what I wanted, I would like to be, you know, have a large enough audience
3853520	3858480	where people have to take me seriously, but not so large that people would start to idolize me,
3860080	3864640	that's where I would like to sit. That's the sweet spot. Yeah, that's the sweet spot for me.
3865920	3869120	I really do hope you get there, I think you are going to get there, because again, you
3870880	3877600	walk through this so precisely, and you can see it, like, you, I mean, in my opinion,
3877600	3882320	you don't, you never come off as disingenuous, you know, and even like with your conversations,
3883200	3888320	I mean, how, I mean, how I and how I'm sure many people approached you at first was through your
3888320	3894960	conversations with Jordan Peterson, and you never came off as disingenuine, you came off as real,
3894960	3900080	you came off as authentic, and I think that's why people ended up, you know, following you, and I
3900080	3907760	think there's, I don't know, I've never really, I mean, this is not a developed thought whatsoever,
3907760	3914000	and I think Jordan Peterson is on the same path, but there's obviously a difference between you
3914000	3919360	and Jordan Peterson, and I'm not just talking about philosophically, you know, I think Jordan
3919360	3927120	probably has a little more proclivity towards the pomp and pageantry of it all, and I don't think
3927120	3931040	that's not a shot, and I think that's actually, that's sometimes a very good thing, and you need
3931040	3936160	people like that, right, because you need people who also are going to talk to the, I mean, you said
3936160	3940160	you want to find that sweet spot, and people have different sweet spots, and there are some
3940160	3946400	individuals who just need to talk to the culture at large, right, and you need that, and sometimes
3946400	3953200	that actually makes you, or that is, it's then taken on the pomp and pageantry of that is actually
3953200	3958880	a necessity, though, because it's part of the game, so, but anyway, I mean, I think that's why,
3960240	3963600	I think that's why a lot of individuals have really linked up with your work, though, is because
3964160	3970080	it's, and I don't know the word to describe it, I'll be honest, I'll just say authentic again,
3970080	3974880	but, and so I think that's really telling that you admitted yourself that you want to find that
3974880	3979680	sweet spot, where you want to get big, but you don't want to get big, right, and I just think
3979680	3984160	that's really cool, to put it really cool, I know that's like, that's not the most profound, I just
3984160	3989520	think it's really cool, though. No, but thank you, thank you. Yeah, Jordan and I are different,
3990320	3996400	yeah, I mean, we have an interesting relationship, and of course it predates him becoming like a
3996400	4007440	superstar that he is, right, we aspire differently, I think Jordan aspires to being,
4007440	4012560	this is half the joke, and I think I've said this to his face and he laughed, so I don't think it's,
4013200	4017200	I don't think it's an appropriate, but he aspires to being Moses, I aspire to being Socrates,
4017200	4020880	and those are very different aspirations, because they're very different aspirations.
4020880	4028000	Right, and, and I agree with you, there are times when we need a Moses figure of a prophet
4028000	4031840	that will lead people to the prophet land, lead them out of bondage to the prophet land,
4031840	4038960	out of promised land, I think Jordan is, you know, I think both his virtues and his vices,
4038960	4043120	and I will admit that I have virtues and vices, so I'm not trying to, but I think both his virtues
4043120	4051360	and his vices orbit around that vision, right, whereas mine are around Socrates, and that's a
4051360	4057280	different vision. Oh, everyone has a mediator, right, I mean, everyone has a mediator, everyone has
4057280	4063440	that object of desire, and the sweet spot in life, right, just really quite, you know,
4063440	4067520	what Gerard would say is that everyone is going to have mediator, it's picking the right mediators,
4067520	4071520	that's what that's, that's exactly it, that's about, and that's the, that's the Socratic
4071520	4077680	prayer, I want that outward and inward to be resonant, and resonant, such that I, I, my life
4077680	4089120	is as virtuous as possible. I mean, try to manage these three things, virtue, virtuosity, and the
4089120	4095600	virtual is sort of what I'm wrestling with a lot, because they intersect and really interesting,
4095600	4099360	and on, and ways that haven't been very well articulated by previous people, because they
4099360	4106320	didn't have the virtual as the third in those three, which in it alters things, like you and I
4106320	4110720	would not be speaking like this without the virtual, what, how does virtuosity and virtue
4110720	4116320	show up here, and how does the, how does the, and the reverse, how does what we do in virtual space
4116320	4122880	translate back into the real space of virtue and virtuosity, these are important questions we
4122880	4127360	were wrestling with, right. No, I meant, and sometimes you got to, they're hard questions,
4127360	4131840	and I think precisely, and so they're so difficult that we're trying to actually
4132560	4139760	have these conversations function in the, in brick and mortar spaces, and so it's like,
4139760	4143840	I know that you are doing, you've been doing conferences, and that there's another conference
4143840	4149920	coming up, and me and my, me and my good friend, Marcus, who runs the channel more Christ, we have
4149920	4158080	an event coming up in DC with Michael Martin, and Paul Vander Clay, and, and, you know, we hope
4158080	4163840	our, our goal actually, one of our goals is that we plan our vision, Marcus don't get mad at me that
4163840	4171760	I'm talking about our vision, but our vision is, you know, we plan on having conferences, hopefully
4171760	4176800	multiple times a year, now Marcus is in Ireland, I mean, I'm in Cleveland, so it's obviously far away,
4176800	4182720	but if we could do like a European thing, and maybe an American conference, another thing that
4182720	4189840	we're thinking of is, you know, doing conferences, it's a conference camp, where a group of 15,
4189840	4198960	16, 20 people is actually a camping trip, right, and that, that, that projects you into a different
4199040	4206320	headspace, and conversation is, oh yeah, living with people is, is just important,
4207040	4212560	we, yeah, Ryan and Eric and I need to talk more about this, we're first doing lots of events,
4213360	4217360	and trying to get regular events going, and regular communities of practice, but we, yeah,
4217360	4222640	we need, we also need, we, we need to have retreats where people live together for a bit,
4223360	4229040	when I went on, we turned to the source last July, with Ray Kelly, living with these people,
4229040	4233760	and pushing yourself to the horizon of horror every day, for spiritual transformation,
4234800	4239920	as an impact on you. Joe, I've got a ghost on it, we've sort of shifted to you being
4241040	4244400	the host, is there any final thing you'd like to ask me before I leave?
4244960	4248480	There is, but I don't know how far we would get into it, but I'll pop it in there, maybe this
4248480	4253360	will leave us for a conversation in the future, really quick, why aren't you putting on this?
4255920	4262160	Physical beauty, is it beauty, are people's physical selves beautiful, or just not ugly?
4266240	4270560	That's to ask the question, if I were to answer it from like a platonic framework is,
4270560	4276880	yeah, came physical bodies, them and shine with beauty, yes. Beautiful, that was a question that
4276880	4282960	was on my mind, and I thought that was going to get me a one sentence answer, so you gave it to me,
4282960	4289200	I appreciate that. One of the most sensitive things in my relationship with my current partner is,
4293920	4300000	by objective measures, she's a physically attractive woman, but so I want that understood,
4300000	4305840	but I was really attracted first, and this had not happened to me before,
4305840	4310240	I was really attracted first, and I'll speak a little bit poetically, because it's appropriate,
4310240	4317520	I was first really first attracted to the beauty of her soul, and then I noticed in conjunction,
4317520	4325760	and as a function of that, I noticed how physically beautiful she is, and that has been really important
4325840	4339360	for me. That was like a, that was a wake up moment for me, and I think we have to be open to very
4339360	4344160	often, and you know, many people argue this played out famously, that we start with physical beauty,
4344160	4352000	and then we move to other, but it's happened that the reverse has been the case for me,
4352960	4358800	really importantly, and I just wanted to note that, I just wanted to note that, I think the
4358800	4365680	question of beauty is very much, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not unidirectional, is what
4365680	4371840	I'm saying, you can both be drawn through the physical to what is beyond, and what is beyond
4371840	4377440	the physical can reach to you first, and then draw you in attraction to the physical.
4378000	4383360	Yeah, all right, that's so true, it's, that like gave me goosebumps when you said that,
4383360	4389200	my wife is absolutely gorgeous, I would say she's absolutely gorgeous, and I would say by
4389200	4393680	side of me, she's absolutely gorgeous, but you know, there's always those times where every woman
4393680	4398560	and every man will get insecure, and you know, my wife sometimes asks me, you know, why, why me,
4399200	4403040	I tell her, because you really have the most beautiful soul that I've ever encountered in
4403040	4408080	my whole life, and you admitted the same thing, so I just think that's really, it's wonderful,
4408080	4414800	it's absolutely wonderful. Yeah, it is, it is, and yeah, I think that's a great, and I think that's
4414800	4418400	a beautiful place to end. Yeah, it is a good place to end, it is a good place to end, thank you,
4418400	4423520	Joe, this has been really wonderful. Yeah, thank you for having me. Oh, thank you for having me,
4423520	4430720	and I will send you a copy of this for your channel, and we'll talk again soon. Thank you so much, Jen.
