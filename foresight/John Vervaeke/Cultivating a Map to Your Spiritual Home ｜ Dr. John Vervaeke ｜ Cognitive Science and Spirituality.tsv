0	3760	We're going to have John Vervakey speak to us now.
3760	7800	He is the founder of the Vervakey Foundation and the Director
7800	10920	of Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto.
10920	13080	He's the creator of the acclaimed Awakening
13080	17040	from the Meeting Crisis and After Socrates series.
17040	33120	Thank you. So, I have a choice here. I can give my talk or answer all of John's questions.
33120	49480	All right. So, I'm changing this title slightly from in the program,
49480	54200	the Cognitive Science of Home Belonging to the Home Range Orienting from the Homebase
54200	61400	and Growing Up Around the Hearth Hospital. I chose the last one solely because it had
61400	66720	H's in it. No, it actually captured better what I wanted to talk about.
66720	71080	So, what I want to do is I want to make use of John A. Allens.
71080	75280	There's going to be two Allens mentioned, so I'll try to keep them clear, separate for you.
75280	79720	John A. Allens' book, Home, How Habitat Made Us Human.
79720	85640	And I want to trace out the evolution of home in three stages towards answering the question,
85720	91120	why do we long for home?
95120	99720	Those three stages is not a ladder, but a nesting, and of course, nesting is a kind of home.
99720	105760	But the three stages are the home range, the home base, and the hearth hospital.
105760	114120	And I'm going to show how each is a stage in the shaping of cognition within 4e Cognitive Science.
114120	120200	And then I want to talk about how that cognition is, I hope, plausibly exacted up into our spirituality
120200	126160	and then talk about domicile and quest in that context.
126160	136680	So, even before we were recognizably human, we were biological, our ancestors were biological organisms,
136680	141440	and there's been a revolution in biology around this that gives us an important aspect
141480	144400	of the first stage of the evolution of home.
144400	146280	This is called niche construction.
146280	150600	So, the old model, which is a sort of Victorian capitalist model,
150600	155240	is you have the individual organism, and they happen to mutate, and that's it.
155240	159040	And then there's the harsh environment of competition that kills them off or they survive.
159040	161960	And it's just that, that's the model.
161960	165160	So, the model is changing, and it's part of the revolution.
165160	168360	The science, where science is happening right now is not physics.
168360	171720	Physics has been stalled for 40 years.
171720	176200	The science, where science is happening is biology.
176200	180520	And it's niche construction is the idea, and the idea is this.
180520	183000	Organisms are not passive.
183000	190440	They are active shapers of their environment, and then that shaped environment in term shapes them.
190440	194920	They shape the environment, the environment shapes them, and it loops like this.
194920	198400	And you notice I do this a lot when I talk about Fourier-Cogsci.
198400	199840	It's that loop.
199840	202000	It's niche construction.
202000	208840	It's a mutual shaping so that they fit together in an important way.
208840	215280	There's a conformity between the organism and the environment.
215280	220720	They belong together.
220720	228440	Now that belonging together is, I'm going to argue, well I'm arguing right now, is what
228440	231320	Kellyanne Allen, this is the second Allen.
231320	234240	First is John A. Second is Kellyanne.
234240	241520	In her work, calls belonging, the sense of belonging.
241520	248440	And please remember the assonance between longing and belonging.
248440	249440	What is belonging?
249440	255960	Belonging is a sense of, quote, deep connection with social groups, physical places, and collective
255960	257760	experiences.
257760	260720	That's from the paper in 2021.
260720	264480	And then there's the book in 2021 as well.
264480	269920	I think that deep connection is in the sense of belonging that she's talking about is deeply
269920	276160	convergent with the work I do on relevance realization and religio and meaning in life
276160	282840	as a fundamental connectedness to yourself, to other people, and to the world.
282840	287800	And as often the case in psychology, we have these two literatures, meaning and life literature,
287800	290960	and the belonging literature talking about basically the same thing and not talking to
290960	294240	each other because psychology is in a mess right now.
294240	300000	And see the work of my good friend Greg Enriquez on how we can fix that problem.
300000	303480	Right now I'll take it as a point of convergence.
303480	309000	In the early end, Alan goes on, it is, quote, a fundamental need that predicts.
309000	311360	Notice the language here.
311360	313640	Psychologists are usually deeply cautious.
313640	317400	It seems to us after the evidence that perhaps it has suggested that.
317400	319720	That's how it usually is written.
319720	322200	But here it's, listen to the language.
322200	324600	It is a fundamental need.
324600	330160	This is like a summative paper that predicts numerous mental, physical, social, economic,
330160	332640	and behavioral outcomes.
332640	335960	In short, the evidence is overwhelming.
335960	339440	This is why when people say, I don't know what it means about the meaning crisis.
339440	345960	In short, if you do not have a sense of belonging, you are in serious trouble.
345960	352960	Mentally, physically, economically, behaviorally, socially.
352960	354960	It's powerfully predictive of that.
354960	357920	Next to knowing your IQ, I want to know if you have a sense of belonging.
357920	362160	I want to know if you have a sense of meaning in life.
362160	365520	And this is how you, there's two questions you can ask to get out to you have meaning
365520	367220	in life.
367220	370200	What do you want to exist even if you don't?
370200	377680	And how connected, how much of a difference do you make to it?
377680	380240	So there's actually two sides.
380240	385800	There's the result, which is belonging, and then there's the process, fitting in.
385800	388760	This is, and we've been using this language probably your whole life, fitting in.
388760	389760	I want to fit in.
389760	390760	I want to fit in.
390760	391760	I don't fit in.
392360	393360	I do this.
393360	394360	Right?
394360	395360	Okay.
395360	403960	But listen to the language fitting in, like this deep, connected, belonging, conformity
403960	407960	participating in.
407960	412080	And I think this has a lot to do as I, I'll only do this a couple more times.
412080	415360	I think this has a lot to do with the recursive relevance realization.
415360	416360	Okay.
417360	425360	But how is that niche construction, organism shaping the environment, environment shaping
425360	426360	the organism.
426360	427360	They belong together.
427360	429760	There's a sense of belonging fit in.
429760	438600	I think that gets taken up into the cognitive and therefore on the cusp of the spiritual
438600	444320	with the work that myself and Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic covered in
444320	448880	the book, Zombies in Western Culture, 21st Century Crisis.
448880	454320	We talked about worldview attunement, which is this idea.
454320	459960	I think that that's basically our religio, niche construction.
459960	468880	You have a view of the world that supports your view of how you view, how you know, how
468880	469880	you connect.
469880	473800	And you have a theory of connection that helps to support and substantiate your view of the
473800	476160	world and they mutually support each other.
476160	479040	And we have that with the Aristotelian worldview.
479040	485680	And then we broke it and smashed it and we haven't had worldview attunement ever since.
485680	492240	And the, you know, a clear indicator of that is, and you've probably heard me make this
492240	497560	argument before, the pervasive worldview, the scientific worldview is a worldview in which
497560	500840	we do not belong, in which we do.
500840	508920	Our existence as cognitive, personal, moral agents doesn't belong.
508920	519480	So if we don't belong in the worldview, it's not doing worldview attunement for us.
519480	527480	So when we have worldview attunement, we get a network of affordances.
527480	534040	Just a reminder what an affordance is, affordance is a living possibility, a real possibility.
534040	538440	It's not created by the environment, it's not created by the organism, it's created
538440	541600	by how they mutually shape each other.
541600	543520	This affords me walking.
543520	549080	I and this have been mutually shaped by physics, by chemistry.
549080	552720	This and I have both been shaped by culture to fit each other.
552720	555640	So walking is available to me, there's an affordance.
555640	562200	There's all kinds of affordances now set out for me because of that co-shaping, fitting
562200	566200	together, belonging together.
566200	575920	Once you have this first stage, you're into an organism having a home range.
575920	581040	This is areas where the it is shaping the environment, the environment is shaping it.
581040	586600	A network of affordances is opening up, it's belonging, they're fitting together.
586600	594240	And space gets transformed into places connected by paths.
594240	599480	And you are looking out at the world and seeing places and paths and you're saying that's
599480	600480	just the way it is.
600480	605040	There are no places and paths in physics.
605040	608040	There's trajectories, there's locations.
609040	619560	In fact, this is so deep in us, in how we've been shaped, think, try to talk for a five
619560	622640	minutes without doing places and paths.
622640	628680	John has just started his lecture, soon he'll be halfway through his lecture, and then he'll
628680	630640	be at his end.
630640	636040	The marriage isn't going well, we seem to be floundering, we're off course.
637040	642840	Paths and places, look out around you, it's happening right now.
642840	646040	You're already starting to home this space.
651040	663040	When you get that, when you get that home range, paths and places, the landscape courses,
663040	666040	I'm using the word course and you're allowed to by the way, it's in the dictionary, I made
666040	667040	sure.
667040	673040	You can use course as a verb, the landscape courses, it flows, we talk about the hills
673040	679040	rolling, they're not rolling, if they were rolling we'd be absolutely terrified.
679040	689040	But I'm reading the great Gatsby long time ago in high school, galaxy far, far away.
690040	693040	And I'm reading this book, and why are they making me read this book?
693040	699040	It's this silly story, Daisy, Daisy, Nick, Grat Gatsby, and then I get, if you've read
699040	702040	the book, spoiler, you haven't.
702040	708040	And then you get to the last three pages and you go, oh my gosh, this whole book has been
708040	710040	about the American dream.
710040	718040	And you go, and there's that, and it first hit me, he's talking about it, and the author,
718040	727040	well Nick, Fitzgerald, pulls back from the tight closure of the story, and he talks about
727040	730040	the rolling hills of the Republic.
730040	737040	And I got this tremendous sense of, wait, there's a bigger thing going on here, there's this
737040	742040	whole landscape, there's this whole history, and it's paths and places and affordances,
742040	746040	and it's all alive, and he was trying to invoke that, and he was actually trying to symbolize
746040	750040	it in this rather trite love story.
750040	755040	It was one of those first great moments in my life when I realized how stupid I could be,
755040	759040	because I totally missed it, and it opened it up for me.
762040	770040	This is a home range, and what's really unique about human beings is their home range is quite
770040	773040	variable, and that's an advantage and a disadvantage.
773040	778040	See, the advantage for the gazelle, here's a gazelle, here's a baby gazelle, it fits right in,
778040	784040	and gazelles don't have existential, how can I be a good gazelle?
784040	788040	I'm failing, they're right in.
788040	795040	Your heritage gave you the capacity for home range like any other organism, but it's a movable home range,
795040	797040	because you know what culture is?
797040	801040	Culture is niche construction on methamphetamines.
802040	803040	That's what culture is.
803040	810040	Culture is, I'm going to go into this environment and I'm going to shape it and shape you so you belong there.
810040	820040	That's what culture is, and that's a great power, but it's also a great uprooting,
820040	826040	because there's no place you naturally belong,
826040	829040	and science fiction regularly reminds us about this.
831040	839040	Organisms are doing this, and at some point our ancestors evolved so that they're becoming hunter-gatherers.
839040	846040	We're not clear about when, probably Homo erectus, probably around 800,000 years ago.
846040	851040	I've held an 800,000-year-old Aschulean hand axe.
856040	858040	What is the next stage?
858040	861040	The next stage is the home base.
861040	868040	The home base is a fixed point within the home range in which everybody goes out from it,
868040	876040	they do stuff, and they come back to it, which seems right natural to you.
876040	882040	They go out and they come back, and then what they do is they share the butchering of the animals,
882040	888040	the preparation of food initially, but something that's really important happening here
888040	892040	when they come back, right?
892040	900040	They're checking each other, because that system of distributed labor
900040	905040	requires you to all come back together, not only for the legitimate reasons,
905040	910040	we have to coordinate our labor, we have the synergy of coordinated communication,
910040	917040	but also in order to do cheater detection.
917040	921040	You shouldn't get the benefits if you haven't borne the costs,
921040	926040	and if you've borne the costs and not have the benefits, then something needs to change.
926040	931040	And if you don't think that's very neat, give your three-year-old,
931040	936040	this three-year-old and that three-year-old, give that one a bigger piece of chocolate cake.
936040	940040	Human beings care so much about this that they will do the following.
940040	943040	If I sit you in a room and I give you $5 and you say,
943040	947040	you can keep the $5, great.
947040	949040	There's more to the science.
949040	951040	Now what you do is you bring in two people and you say,
951040	957040	I'll give you $5, but only if you allow me to give him $10.
957040	959040	And then guess what they do?
959040	962040	No, I don't want it.
962040	968040	They're still getting $5 for free, but they don't want it because that has been broken down.
968040	975040	See, what we start to get into is a new normative space.
975040	991040	We're starting to think about the justice of our actions as opposed to just the efficacy of our actions.
991040	995040	So we've got distributed labor.
995040	1003040	Now that requires something really, so far we've got this concern for justice, looking for cheating,
1003040	1010040	but looking for honoring because the opposite of catching a cheater is honoring somebody who's followed, played the rules.
1010040	1013040	Distributed labor.
1013040	1020040	You're going out there, I'm going out there, and we can't talk to each other.
1021040	1029040	Imagine if you had to run back every five minutes, and now we forget this.
1029040	1034040	See, I don't know how old John Van Dink is, I'm pretty old too.
1034040	1043040	So I grew up in this dark time in which your phone was in one place.
1043040	1057040	And you had to leave your phone behind, and you had to rely on other things to coordinate your behavior with other human beings.
1057040	1062040	It's funny, we still call it a phone, but if you actually call somebody on it, they freak out.
1062040	1065040	Why are you calling me?
1065040	1069040	So think about what we had to rely on.
1069040	1074040	And here's a way of getting this a little bit closer.
1074040	1081040	So imagine a married couple that has been married for a long time because they love each other, not because they hate each other.
1081040	1087040	Sometimes people stay together in marriage because they hate each other, because that's the greatest way to torture another human being.
1087040	1091040	That was my parents.
1092040	1103040	But I had the opposite, and my aunt and uncle and my aunt, this aunt, she was like a second mother to me.
1103040	1113040	They had been married, well, longer than I was alive, and when she came in the room, his eyes sparkled.
1113040	1117040	And there was like a telepathy between them.
1117040	1127040	He could just, eyes sparkle, and they almost didn't have to talk, and it's like, what's going on?
1127040	1137040	Well, what's going on is, you have two human beings, and they're not always consulting each other.
1137040	1139040	They've internalized each other.
1139040	1142040	She has a model of him. He has a model of her.
1142040	1150040	So he can be over here, out of range of her, and coordinate his behavior with her by consulting the model.
1150040	1153040	But he has to let her live inside him.
1153040	1158040	Some of you have said something sort of a little bit freaky to me, but I've tried to take it in good heart.
1158040	1163040	You say things to me like, John, you're in my head all day. That's a little bit weird for me.
1163040	1167040	But you see what you're doing? You're internalizing.
1167040	1170040	Now, the thing is, you can't internalize forever.
1170040	1176040	So what you have to do is, you have to periodically all come together, the nexus point,
1176040	1182040	and make sure the models all match, that they haven't got out of sync.
1182040	1188040	So the ability to go out and do distributed labor, which is how we build this,
1188040	1197040	requires that we come together and have a common point, a common unity,
1197040	1202040	a community in which we correct how the models get out of sync with each other.
1202040	1205040	And that's what Paul, I think, and Jonathan are often talking about.
1205040	1209040	Church can be a pretty shitty place.
1209040	1213040	Because you have all these, oh, that's not how it is.
1213040	1219040	But what's really interesting is your brain actually works this way.
1219040	1223040	So your brain face is a problem. It's actually not one machine.
1223040	1226040	It's a machine of machines that can make itself into a new kind of machine,
1226040	1231040	which is unlike anything we have right now yet.
1231040	1236040	And these can, well, we all know, they can work at cross purposes.
1236040	1239040	They can be antagonistic to each other.
1239040	1244040	So the way we deal with that problem of things working at cross purposes
1244040	1248040	is we have them communicate. That improves efficiency.
1248040	1252040	So we can improve efficiency by having parts of the brain talk to each other all the time.
1252040	1255040	There's a problem with that. Two problems is when the brain is talking a lot to itself,
1255040	1259040	it's not paying much attention to the world.
1259040	1265040	Secondly, when all that energy is being expended, it's very expensive.
1265040	1268040	This is what the brain does.
1268040	1272040	It actually does, has different areas of the brain.
1272040	1275040	They model each other. They mutually model each other.
1275040	1277040	And then the brain cycles.
1277040	1282040	It cycles between you're focused on the world, right,
1282040	1285040	and all the parts are relying on the model of each other to coordinate
1285040	1288040	without talking to each other very much, so all of that energy can be channeled.
1288040	1291040	And then it goes to another time when you're basically not focused on the world
1291040	1293040	and all the parts are talking to each other.
1293040	1296040	Your attention is trying to do it right now.
1296040	1298040	Because part of your attention is task focused.
1298040	1303040	What is he going to say next? He's so weird.
1303040	1308040	And then there's another part of you that is trying to mind-wander.
1308040	1311040	Mind-wandering is when you disconnect from the world
1311040	1315040	and the parts are basically talking to each other for what purpose?
1315040	1319040	Mind-wandering.
1319040	1322040	It seems like the most useless thing and you spend so much time in mind-wandering
1322040	1327040	because this is when the models all connect and make sure they're tracking each other
1327040	1330040	and you cycle back and forth and your attention is trying to do it right now.
1330040	1333040	And then you get an advantage out of that.
1333040	1338040	The mind-wandering opens up variations of things and perspectives that are relevant to you
1338040	1340040	because you're always the hero of your mind-wandering.
1340040	1341040	You don't mind-wander.
1341040	1344040	Hey, I'm going to mind-wander about Pete Seeger or somebody else.
1344040	1347040	You mind? It's always you.
1347040	1350040	It's you. How are things relevant to me?
1350040	1355040	In fact, what's happening is, you know, John Veracchis, it's not really relevant to me.
1355040	1357040	Here's a bunch of stuff that's relevant to me.
1357040	1359040	That's mind-wandering.
1359040	1364040	And then what you do is you open up the possibilities of how things are relevant.
1364040	1366040	You open up variation on what you can pay attention to
1366040	1370040	and then you kill most of it off when you come back to focusing on me.
1370040	1374040	But some of it stays and you make connections that are relevant to you.
1374040	1377040	You evolve your attentional fit.
1377040	1379040	Variation with the mind-wandering.
1379040	1381040	Selection with the task focus.
1381040	1387040	And you do this and you're evolving your connectedness.
1387040	1394040	We figured out with home range and home base how to do that with collective intelligence.
1394040	1399040	We all go out with our mutual models and then we come back into common unity, the community,
1399040	1403040	and we do all this stuff that seems relatively useless so that we, right,
1404040	1410040	and the whole community evolves its grip on the world.
1422040	1429040	So this interaction between home range and home base starts to evolve
1429040	1433040	and develop intelligence, collective intelligence,
1433040	1436040	the intelligence of distributed cognition.
1436040	1440040	And then of course what happens is individual cognition and collective cognition
1440040	1444040	start to bootstrap each other.
1444040	1448040	If I internalize her and she internalizes me,
1448040	1451040	she can actually take my perspective on her perspective.
1451040	1453040	That's what she's doing when she's doing that coordinated.
1453040	1456040	But then she can just do that when she needs to.
1456040	1458040	Not just when she's coordinating with me.
1458040	1460040	I can, what would John think?
1460040	1463040	What would Jonathan, what would Paul think?
1463040	1468040	Oh, your metacognitive capacities expand dramatically.
1468040	1472040	Your ability to be aware of how you're aware, to know how you're knowing,
1472040	1477040	to learn how to learn all goes up significantly.
1477040	1483040	This is all enmeshed with home range and home base.
1484040	1490040	But how is the home base chosen?
1490040	1493040	Well, think about campfire.
1493040	1496040	How do you choose it?
1496040	1500040	So there's a theory, we've got to modify the theory because the empirical record
1500040	1503040	for the initial presentation of the theory has made up and modified.
1503040	1506040	The original theory is prospect and refuge.
1506040	1510040	Prospect and refuge says you're always looking for places where you have
1510040	1513040	significant prospects so you can see a lot.
1513040	1517040	But there's refuge for you.
1517040	1521040	Now, originally they thought that was, like, I want to be able to see a lot,
1521040	1524040	but I want to be able to hide a lot.
1524040	1526040	And that turns out to be wrong.
1526040	1528040	Because it makes predictions.
1528040	1532040	You show people pictures of, like, here's all this expanse you can see,
1532040	1535040	but you're also sort of in a jungle and people don't want to be there.
1535040	1539040	Because here's the thing, if you could hide in it, so could someone else.
1540040	1541040	So could a predator.
1541040	1543040	So you don't want lots of hiding places.
1543040	1549040	So it's more like what I want in refuge is I want a place where I can defend myself
1549040	1553040	or escape, reliably escape.
1553040	1556040	So when I say refuge, I want you to hear that, okay?
1556040	1558040	Now think about this, because I've been thinking about this
1558040	1562040	and what Paul was saying about rest and how it's not just lastitude.
1562040	1564040	And I was thinking, what went through my head was this phrase,
1564040	1569040	a refuge without prospect is a prison.
1569040	1572040	And prospect without refuge is wilderness.
1572040	1575040	You don't want either of those.
1575040	1578040	You don't want either of those.
1578040	1582040	So this might surprise you that I would make this move.
1582040	1588040	You're seeking for an optimal grip between that trade-off relationship.
1588040	1590040	And so you're trying to pick a place.
1590040	1593040	So you've got all this affordance network.
1593040	1599040	You want a place that gives you this sort of optimal grip between prospect and refuge.
1599040	1600040	It's a nexus point.
1600040	1606040	It gives you easy access to many different courses of action you can undertake.
1610040	1614040	Now I want you to think about what a way of thinking about that.
1614040	1616040	I'm going to use a martial arts analogy.
1616040	1618040	I think I used it in Thunder Bay, but I'm going to use it again.
1618040	1621040	It's a slightly different one, okay?
1622040	1626040	So the reason I'm using this is because I'm going to really play on optimal gripping.
1626040	1628040	There's things when you're doing and you're grappling with somebody
1628040	1631040	and you need to get literally the optimal grip on them to throw them.
1631040	1633040	Like you don't want to lean too far forward because then they can,
1633040	1636040	you know, that's not going to, you got to do this thing.
1636040	1642040	So there's all these different things you're doing that are optimal grips on your opponent.
1642040	1643040	But you don't start out that way.
1643040	1645040	You start out, you take your stance.
1645040	1647040	Now this doesn't do anything.
1647040	1650040	You don't use this for anything.
1650040	1652040	What's the point of a stance?
1652040	1656040	So think about all the optimal grippings I can have.
1656040	1662040	The stance puts me in an optimal place to get to any of those optimal gripping.
1662040	1663040	Do you understand?
1663040	1667040	The stance allows me, oh, if I hear, I can quickly,
1667040	1670040	if I'm here, I can, right, I can quickly step back if I need to.
1670040	1671040	I can come over.
1671040	1674040	I can, right, there's all these things I can do from the stance.
1676040	1677040	You have a stance.
1678040	1682040	It's, it's your meta optimal grip.
1682040	1687040	And I have to have a few metas or you wouldn't believe it was me giving the talk, right?
1687040	1690040	It's your meta optimal grip point.
1690040	1697040	And it's at the point that gives you the best optimal relationship between prospect and refuge.
1697040	1699040	And then you have this point.
1699040	1704040	It's the point that is your entry into the affordance network.
1705040	1707040	It's giving you meta optimal grip.
1708040	1714040	It's an origin point for all of the journeys that you're going to take and you're going to come back to.
1717040	1725040	It allows you to navigate your home range and to share that with other people
1725040	1731040	because we can all mutually model the origin point so that we can easily coordinate our behavior.
1735040	1741040	So that you get the ability to undertake what's called orientation.
1741040	1744040	This is the work of Stegmeyer.
1744040	1749040	2019 is an astonishing book on orientation, the philosophy of orientation.
1749040	1752040	And he talks about how orient the ability.
1752040	1753040	Okay.
1753040	1757040	So if you were to ask many people today how they're wrestling with things,
1757040	1762040	they will use metaphors or they will even use the word I feel disoriented.
1765040	1767040	I don't know which way is up or down.
1767040	1769040	I don't know which way to go.
1769040	1771040	And it's all metaphorical.
1771040	1775040	They're talking about this fundamental ability of orientation.
1777040	1778040	Right.
1778040	1780040	When we orient, I want to coin a word.
1780040	1781040	I don't know if it's a word.
1781040	1785040	I want to talk about co-orientation like the way we talk about coordination.
1785040	1791040	We have co-orientation when we have the home base.
1792040	1798040	And we take that up into our worldview and we can navigate the worldview.
1799040	1804040	We can co-orient in that worldview and move around in that space
1805040	1809040	so that we can coordinate our distributed cognition,
1809040	1812040	access that collective intelligence.
1812040	1817040	That's what orientation does for you, shared orientation.
1818040	1820040	We even do it.
1820040	1822040	We even do it temporally.
1822040	1824040	We've been talking about this.
1824040	1825040	Right.
1826040	1828040	We have retrospective.
1830040	1831040	Right.
1831040	1833040	We have this retrospective.
1833040	1838040	We want, remember I didn't mean rest.
1838040	1840040	Sorry, I didn't mean hiding.
1841040	1848040	The path should provide some kind of refuge for us now.
1848040	1852040	It should have, all of these things should have converged
1852040	1856040	so that we have a trustworthy home base
1856040	1859040	that then gives us prospect for the future.
1859040	1862040	We feel so that we can properly do this.
1862040	1866040	We can, there's a common unity
1866040	1869040	that gives us a common law of the precedent
1869040	1873040	that has been vouchsafed to us from the past.
1873040	1878040	And then it encourages us to be prospectively responsible
1878040	1881040	and try and set precedent for the people in the future.
1881040	1885040	And this of course is random's work on reason and philosophy,
1885040	1887040	his new interpretation of Hegel.
1887040	1890040	And that what we're trying to do is constantly find ourselves
1890040	1894040	in that stream, in that course of the common law
1894040	1896040	of distributed cognition.
1896040	1901040	We can draw from the past and we can prospect to the future
1901040	1903040	and then we are oriented.
1905040	1907040	Then we are oriented.
1914040	1917040	So, we've got the home base
1918040	1921040	and it's within the home range
1921040	1924040	and then all of this is within the horizon.
1925040	1928040	But with the home base and the home range
1928040	1930040	we have this sort of resonance field
1930040	1934040	in which the land flows, we belong to it.
1934040	1938040	And then on top of it we have this ability to orient
1938040	1941040	and to co-orient and to form community
1941040	1945040	and access not only the community here now
1945040	1948040	but the community of the past and the community of the future.
1948040	1951040	And I take it that Christians represent that
1951040	1954040	with the community of the saints and things like that.
1955040	1957040	Or at least some branch of Christians.
1957040	1960040	I have to be honest, sometimes I can't keep all of you straight.
1963040	1965040	And I say that affectionately.
1966040	1968040	So what happens with this orientation
1968040	1970040	is remember with the first thing,
1970040	1973040	space became places linked by paths.
1973040	1977040	Now the paths and the places are transformed into maps.
1978040	1980040	Cognitive maps.
1982040	1985040	And a map is a powerful thing.
1985040	1987040	And then what Descartes did, by the way,
1987040	1989040	he figured out how to take our mapping ability
1989040	1992040	and our orienting ability and turn it into a graph
1992040	1994040	because that's all it is.
1994040	1997040	It's a mapping from an origin point.
1997040	1999040	That's why it's called the origin point, by the way,
1999040	2001040	on a Cartesian graph.
2003040	2007040	See, what a map does is it reduces your cognitive load.
2009040	2012040	You don't have to remember all the idiosyncratic paths and pathways.
2012040	2016040	You don't have to, by the way, in the dark times,
2016040	2018040	you didn't have Siri,
2018040	2023040	we would go to the glove box
2025040	2027040	and we would retrieve the parchment.
2027040	2032040	We called them maps and we would open the map.
2033040	2037040	And I had never trod this path or been in that place.
2038040	2040040	But I could find my way.
2040040	2042040	I didn't have to.
2042040	2044040	See, once you have a map,
2044040	2047040	you don't have to hold all the paths and places.
2047040	2049040	Imagine if your environment was the way you treat your house.
2049040	2051040	You had to memorize it.
2053040	2056040	So your range gets limited when you don't have cognitive maps.
2056040	2058040	When you have cognitive maps,
2058040	2063040	you can go to all kinds of places you haven't been before
2063040	2065040	with confidence.
2065040	2068040	I encourage you to interpolate, extrapolate,
2068040	2073040	to go into the unknown with a kind of confidence.
2077040	2081040	It charges that space.
2081040	2083040	Sorry, that's not even right.
2083040	2086040	It charges that relationship between the home base,
2086040	2088040	the home range and the horizon.
2088040	2090040	It charges it.
2090040	2092040	It becomes a resonance field.
2092040	2094040	It's resonant with possibilities for you
2094040	2098040	because you won't be overwhelmed because you have the map.
2108040	2112040	So now you see the belonging and the co-orienting are actually,
2112040	2114040	they're not being left behind.
2114040	2119040	They're mutually nested within each other, growing each other.
2119040	2123040	Now we move to the third, which is the hearth and hospital.
2123040	2125040	Now I need you to hear something.
2125040	2127040	The word hospital.
2127040	2131040	Hear it the way it originally was meant in the word hospitality.
2135040	2138040	So sometime after we started home basing,
2138040	2140040	our ancestors get fire.
2142040	2144040	And they start to reliably use it.
2144040	2147040	And there's a lot of dispute about how ancient that is,
2147040	2151040	but it's reliably we've got evidence for 500,000 years.
2151040	2153040	Some older sites maybe we don't know.
2153040	2156040	And we don't know, like if we don't quite know
2156040	2160040	if the home basing is first and the fire comes along
2160040	2162040	or the fire and the home basing come together.
2162040	2164040	We don't know.
2164040	2166040	I'm just giving you, so I'm talking more about stages
2166040	2169040	than perhaps the actual historical sequence.
2169040	2173040	What happens around the hearth in the hospital?
2173040	2175040	Healing.
2175040	2180040	We start to really start to heal each other when we're sick,
2180040	2182040	when we're wounded.
2182040	2185040	And that again seems as the natural thing to do for you.
2185040	2191040	It's not, right, for most organisms, right?
2191040	2194040	Of course, we have now the nursery.
2194040	2196040	And think about how the nursery and the healing overlap.
2196040	2198040	We talk about nurses.
2198040	2200040	They're not raising children.
2200040	2202040	They're healing the sick.
2202040	2205040	We see a relationship between those.
2205040	2208040	Now what's happening when you have the home base
2208040	2213040	and the hearth is you've got the extension of agopic love
2213040	2219040	from the mother and the child to the extended family.
2219040	2222040	That is a huge, huge advantage.
2222040	2227040	That's a huge advantage.
2227040	2230040	This is why for many people, people who don't have houses,
2230040	2233040	like the indigenous people in Australia,
2233040	2234040	they don't have houses.
2234040	2236040	They have kinship systems.
2236040	2241040	That's how they feel at home.
2241040	2245040	And they're really, like, it's hard to figure out.
2245040	2247040	It's so complex, even convoluted,
2247040	2250040	and sophisticated the way the kinship systems work
2250040	2253040	and the way you name people so that, like,
2253040	2254040	you're my mother-in-law.
2254040	2255040	What?
2255040	2259040	Well, because, and it's just, like, it's bizarre.
2259040	2262040	Like, I'm struggling to understand it from the outside,
2262040	2265040	but all I know is it's impressive.
2265040	2267040	There's, of course, food sharing,
2267040	2269040	and we still do that.
2269040	2272040	We just did it.
2272040	2275040	Until we had phones in the dark time,
2275040	2277040	eating up, you'd go to a restaurant
2277040	2278040	and you ate by yourself.
2278040	2283040	It was awful.
2283040	2286040	Or that's, so there's the looker,
2286040	2290040	or there's the ignorer.
2290040	2292040	Now what we do is we pretend that we're important
2292040	2295040	and we're obviously involved with something new.
2295040	2297040	My phone.
2297040	2301040	The president's talking to me.
2301040	2302040	Right?
2302040	2304040	And, of course, as I said, there's social bonding.
2304040	2308040	But think about what's also going on in the hearth.
2308040	2311040	There's the fire.
2311040	2313040	And what I said,
2313040	2315040	to really pick up on what Jonathan was saying,
2315040	2317040	think about what fire is.
2317040	2320040	Fire shines and it withdraws at the same time.
2320040	2324040	You can follow it, but you can't grab it.
2324040	2326040	It's about, so you're in this place
2326040	2328040	where all these transformations are happening.
2328040	2329040	The kitchen is a transformation.
2329040	2332040	The food, the child rearing, the healing,
2332040	2333040	all this transformation.
2333040	2337040	And then you've got this incarnation of transformation,
2337040	2340040	elusively present there.
2340040	2342040	And Matt Rosano has talked about,
2342040	2344040	like, that being around campfires
2344040	2347040	probably affected, right,
2347040	2349040	in the niche construction manner,
2349040	2351040	the evolution of our intelligence.
2351040	2357040	Because fire is hypnotic.
2357040	2358040	It's amazing.
2358040	2359040	Human beings...
2359040	2366040	You light a fire in there.
2366040	2368040	And part of the problem with the video world
2368040	2370040	is it generates the campfire effect,
2370040	2373040	but there's no campfire.
2373040	2374040	Pause on that.
2374040	2376040	See, when I'm in a campfire,
2376040	2378040	your face is lit and only your face,
2378040	2380040	and I don't see the rest of you,
2380040	2382040	like a video screen,
2382040	2384040	which is lit and I don't see the rest of you.
2384040	2385040	You're very close.
2385040	2388040	You're closer than you normally are with somebody at a campfire.
2388040	2390040	Same with the video screen.
2390040	2394040	But we don't have a common origin.
2394040	2395040	We don't have the fire.
2395040	2401040	We don't have the fire reminding us of the reality,
2401040	2403040	of how being shines forth,
2403040	2406040	but always also withdraws.
2406040	2408040	And no wonder that Heraclitus,
2408040	2412040	who brought the notion of the logos into philosophical
2412040	2415040	and then ultimately religious use,
2415040	2421040	chose the fire as the symbol of the logos.
2421040	2424040	And we talk about conversations that catch fire,
2424040	2427040	because fire has its ability to catch and organize and grow.
2427040	2428040	It shines and withdraws.
2428040	2430040	It appears and it disappears.
2430040	2431040	And this is reality.
2431040	2433040	And what we can do with the fire,
2433040	2435040	which is so chaotic,
2435040	2438040	is we can get into symbolic resonance with it.
2438040	2442040	It can make us aware of the transformation that's happening in us.
2442040	2444040	And then we can see more in the fire
2444040	2446040	than just its superficial presence.
2446040	2448040	We start to see more deeply into it,
2448040	2451040	and it starts to disclose something more deeply into us,
2451040	2453040	and we symbolically resonance,
2453040	2456040	and we start to get ontological depth perception happening.
2456040	2459040	And then we also start doing that with each other around the campfire.
2459040	2461040	I open myself up so you can see into me,
2461040	2464040	and you open yourself up so you can see into me.
2464040	2466040	And we do this, and we reciprocally open,
2466040	2468040	and we get ontological depth perception.
2468040	2473040	So what's happening is
2473040	2479040	we start to do things that the kids are already doing around the hearth.
2479040	2484040	Symbolically resonant, serious play called ritual.
2484040	2489040	Imaginally augmented perception and conception.
2489040	2492040	The serious play designed not for any goal,
2492040	2498040	but for transformation itself.
2498040	2500040	And there's a process there.
2500040	2504040	Rituals have a rationality to them.
2504040	2506040	It's not the rationality of propositions.
2506040	2510040	A ritual is rational, ratio, properly proportioned,
2510040	2515040	if it transfers broadly and deeply outside of the context
2515040	2518040	in which the ritual is practiced.
2518040	2520040	The point isn't in the ritual.
2520040	2522040	It is, but it isn't.
2522040	2525040	What I mean is, if the ritual just stays in the ritual,
2525040	2528040	Kierkegaard has this wonderful parable about this.
2528040	2530040	There's a bunch of geese, they walk into a church,
2530040	2535040	and they all sing about flying, and then they walk out.
2535040	2538040	And he said, that's a lot of Christianity today.
2538040	2543040	And he's a Christian.
2543040	2545040	Fire walking, fire.
2545040	2547040	Fire walking is a ritual around the world.
2547040	2550040	Why? It seems so bizarre and strange.
2550040	2551040	What's going on?
2551040	2553040	Well, here's what's going on.
2553040	2557040	When I'm walking on coals, they're actually slow conductors of heat.
2557040	2561040	So if I walk fast enough, I won't get burned.
2561040	2564040	But if I walk too fast, I'll kick up the coals and I'll get burned.
2564040	2566040	So I have to get my timing just right.
2566040	2571040	So I have all of this mindfulness about, I get right,
2571040	2574040	very mindful of a situation, so I get the timing just right.
2574040	2577040	Now, do you think that ability transfers broadly and deeply in your life?
2577040	2580040	You better believe it.
2580040	2585040	So fire walking, the fire.
2585040	2593040	We get that in the hearth.
2593040	2594040	So what's happening here?
2594040	2599040	Well, at that origin point that's been horizontal, the map,
2599040	2602040	we now get the vertical intersecting.
2602040	2608040	We discover spaces below and spaces above and how to navigate those spaces
2608040	2610040	and return to the origin point.
2610040	2612040	And this is ancient.
2612040	2616040	We've got clear evidence of at least 15,000 years ago of shamans
2616040	2618040	and the three-tiered cosmos.
2618040	2628040	There's the underworld, this world, and the overworld.
2628040	2632040	There's the pathological depth perception, navigating it.
2632040	2638040	We're taking all of these other skills from the home range and the home base
2638040	2643040	and we're taking them up into the ritualization and the transformation
2643040	2647040	around the hearth and the hospital and we're getting the vertical dimension
2647040	2650040	and where the vertical dimension intersects the origin point,
2650040	2653040	you have the axis mundi.
2653040	2656040	And as Jonathan is frequently pointing out to you,
2656040	2664040	that's what the cross and the tree represent, if I understand him correctly.
2664040	2667040	And you nod when those symbols come out,
2667040	2670040	but try to be abstract for a moment and step outside of it.
2670040	2671040	It's like me coming up to you and saying,
2671040	2678040	it's all about the squirrel and the wash basin.
2678040	2680040	What?
2680040	2682040	But if I say, it's all about this axis mundi,
2682040	2685040	this tree that grows to the depths and to the heights.
2686040	2698040	And of course, trees are also the source of wood which provides fire.
2698040	2706040	Okay.
2706040	2716040	So, all of this is being lost.
2716040	2719040	You might have heard me talk about this.
2719040	2724040	We're all experiencing domicile.
2724040	2729040	So, Kellyanne Allen who does work on belonging.
2729040	2735040	Belonging is declining massively and quickly with horrible consequences.
2735040	2738040	Undeniable empirical evidence.
2738040	2743040	One sure measure, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?
2743040	2748040	No matter how connected we are, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?
2748040	2752040	How much of your days are lonely, reliably going up?
2752040	2753040	Just one measure.
2753040	2756040	There's many other measures just to give you a clear example of that.
2756040	2759040	You know, and this is like, I've said this before,
2759040	2761040	this is like something out of Orwell.
2761040	2766040	The United Kingdom has set up a ministry of loneliness
2766040	2770040	because they figured out that if they don't fix this problem,
2770040	2776040	they're in a lot of trouble.
2776040	2780040	Of course, I don't think the United States will do such a thing
2780040	2783040	and Canada isn't doing anything right now.
2783040	2792040	So, all that religio, meaning in life, belongingness,
2792040	2797040	worldview, attunement, that's all going away.
2797040	2801040	The loss of our awareness and appreciation of the non-propositional,
2801040	2806040	knowing so that we can rightly and deeply participate in ritual.
2806040	2809040	Notice how the word ritual, post-Freud,
2809040	2815040	has become the way of talking about an obsessive pathology.
2815040	2822040	That's how far we've come.
2822040	2824040	And of course, as Brian Wallace said,
2824040	2828040	home is where we take the symbols that are in our,
2828040	2833040	like right there, pregnant, like the path that's right there.
2833040	2836040	And that's how I think, it's how I think about intentionality.
2836040	2839040	We take the symbols right there, ready to be birthed,
2839040	2842040	and then we have to set it into a ritual community,
2842040	2845040	and that is what we do to make a home.
2845040	2849040	A home is a machine in which symbol and ritual come together.
2849040	2852040	And if you don't think that's what a home is,
2852040	2858040	skip Christmas next time and see how everybody reacts around it.
2858040	2860040	No, we're just not going to do Christmas this year.
2860040	2863040	We're not going to decorate, we're not going to do this.
2864040	2868040	People will hate you in a way you've never been hated before.
2876040	2883040	We've lost co-orientation, origin point, the vertical.
2883040	2885040	We've been reduced to the horizontal.
2885040	2887040	We've lost the Axis Mundi.
2887040	2889040	But as I've tried to show,
2889040	2892040	all of those things are part of who and what we are.
2892040	2898040	So as they have come into question, we have come into question.
2904040	2910040	We are in question in a way, and Heidegger is the prophet of this.
2910040	2913040	He says we are the beings whose being is in question.
2915040	2919040	And the fact that we lack an ability to wonder in that fashion
2919040	2923040	is precisely what he says is one of the origins of nihilism for us.
2925040	2928040	So when we wonder, we call ourselves in the world into question.
2928040	2930040	But we also wander.
2930040	2932040	Wandering is when we're disoriented and we don't know where to go.
2932040	2936040	So we're wondering and wandering as we're in question,
2936040	2940040	as we're seeking orientation, as we're trying to find the origin
2940040	2943040	that will put us into right relationship to the horizon.
2943040	2945040	And that is exactly what a quest is.
2945040	2949040	The word quest and question are related for a deep reason.
2949040	2952040	In a quest, you are what's in question.
2952040	2955040	You're wondering as you're wandering.
2955040	2960040	There is no answer to the question without the transformation
2960040	2963040	that is brought about by undergoing the quest.
2967040	2970040	We need a reciprocal reconstruction of our worldview.
2970040	2974040	We need to bring back the reinventio of co-orientation.
2974040	2978040	We need the reinventio of symbolic resonance and ritual.
2978040	2981040	We need to do this in a coordinated fashion.
2984040	2987040	We started not on time. How much time do I have left?
2990040	2992040	Pardon me?
2992040	2994040	Nine minutes.
2994040	2997040	That's perfect. Nine's good. I'm happy.
2997040	2999040	Okay.
2999040	3009040	So, part of what has to do,
3009040	3014040	and I really had this in my notes before Jonathan gave his talk,
3014040	3021040	part of it has to do with a relationship.
3021040	3026040	We have to get back to this fundamental orientation point
3026040	3028040	in our meta-optimal gripping.
3028040	3032040	We have to get all the way back there because that's how deep the problem is.
3032040	3037040	Attempting to solve the problem anywhere that's more shallow than that
3037040	3041040	won't give us the transformation of the ontological depth perception that we need.
3043040	3049040	We have to get back to that orientation, which we're so badly lacking.
3049040	3055040	The problem is, when you lack orientation, you don't know which way to go to get it.
3059040	3061040	So, you can see the 20th...
3061040	3064040	Well, you can see actually all of the centuries since the Enlightenment
3064040	3067040	is us thrashing around, trying to...
3067040	3072040	First of all, what we'll do is we'll get an absolute foundation in science and math,
3072040	3076040	and that will be our origin and that fell apart.
3076040	3079040	What we'll do is we'll actually...
3079040	3082040	We'll take into our hands technology and we'll build the...
3082040	3084040	Oh, no.
3085040	3088040	In fact, right?
3088040	3091040	And I don't want to talk about this too much, right?
3091040	3093040	Well, if you want to talk about it, I'll talk about it.
3093040	3095040	I don't want to talk about it right now.
3095040	3099040	But the advent of AGI, which is now on the horizon,
3099040	3105040	and if you hear one thing I say to you,
3105040	3108040	it's don't pretend that's not the case.
3109040	3111040	Don't pretend that's not the case.
3111040	3114040	We need the very best from all of us right now
3114040	3117040	and pretending it's not the case is not helping.
3117040	3119040	It is harming.
3124040	3128040	So, what do we need to do?
3130040	3134040	We have to get to this ability where we can reorient
3134040	3138040	because the advent of AI has said to us,
3138040	3141040	the promise of the Enlightenment, not the promise of Enlightenment,
3141040	3143040	that's a different thing.
3143040	3145040	The promise of the Enlightenment.
3145040	3148040	The Promethean promise.
3148040	3153040	We have discovered that history is not about God or being
3153040	3156040	or the true or the good or the beautiful.
3156040	3158040	History is about us.
3158040	3160040	We are the authors of history.
3160040	3161040	We are the telos.
3161040	3162040	We are the point of history.
3162040	3165040	The point of history is to bring us to completion
3165040	3168040	as free agents in the world.
3168040	3169040	What's freedom?
3169040	3170040	Don't ask that.
3170040	3172040	Freedom, freedom.
3175040	3177040	And there's a lot of good...
3177040	3180040	I don't want to live in a world before the Enlightenment.
3181040	3186040	But we paid this price because we started down a course of action
3186040	3189040	that has got us to the...
3190040	3194040	I work with Jeffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.
3194040	3197040	He is the Godfather of artificial intelligence.
3197040	3201040	He quit his job so that he could speak freely
3201040	3204040	about the serious danger we're in right now.
3208040	3210040	The Enlightenment promised all of this,
3210040	3213040	and then we get to this place where we told,
3213040	3215040	oh, by the way, you weren't what this was all about,
3215040	3218040	and you are no longer the authors of history.
3218040	3221040	And you actually aren't going to matter very soon.
3224040	3227040	We tried that, and then we tried the vacillation
3227040	3230040	between various utopias and nostalgias,
3230040	3232040	and we fight bloody, titanic wars over it,
3232040	3235040	and it's all for bloody nothing.
3241040	3243040	Jonathan spoke of a sacrifice.
3243040	3245040	We need to make a profound sacrifice
3247040	3250040	to get back to the point where reorientation is possible,
3250040	3253040	so that co-orientation is possible,
3253040	3256040	so that real community is possible.
3260040	3263040	We have to get to a kind...
3265040	3267040	See, I want to talk about something,
3267040	3270040	but I don't want you to hear a particular state.
3270040	3272040	I want you to hear the possibility
3272040	3275040	for the transformation of character that's in this.
3277040	3280040	So this goes to some of my scientific work.
3280040	3283040	I was at a monastery, Buddhist monastery,
3283040	3285040	just to keep things even,
3285040	3288040	I'm going to a Christian monastery after I'm here.
3288040	3291040	All balanced, and it's an Eastern Orthodox one,
3291040	3293040	so there you go, Jonathan.
3296040	3298040	But I was in a Buddhist monastery,
3298040	3300040	and I was talking about all the relevance realizations,
3300040	3302040	and I got talking to them,
3302040	3304040	and there was this sort of creative tension,
3304040	3306040	and I had a bunch of insights,
3306040	3308040	and it was in dialogue with other people,
3308040	3311040	something that had always been sort of like,
3311040	3313040	what is the proper stance,
3313040	3316040	stance, orientation,
3316040	3319040	towards being and the ground of being?
3322040	3324040	We don't ask that question, we presuppose we have answers,
3324040	3326040	but we don't have answers anymore,
3326040	3328040	and we got to get back to that.
3328040	3330040	What is the proper stance?
3332040	3335040	What are all these places that people are getting to
3335040	3337040	in their mind and spirit?
3337040	3341040	I don't care which entity you posit at being in right now.
3341040	3343040	And then I realized something,
3343040	3345040	and it helped me make sense of what I was reading
3345040	3347040	in the Tate Chen,
3347040	3349040	what I'm reading in Dojin,
3349040	3352040	and actually also what I'm reading in Maximus.
3354040	3356040	I hope that doesn't offend anybody,
3356040	3359040	because I mean it with affection.
3362040	3366040	Relevance realization is about our optimal gripping on things.
3366040	3368040	We even have a meta-optimal grip.
3368040	3370040	We have to get past that.
3372040	3375040	We have to start, that's what Jonathan was arguing.
3375040	3377040	We have to stop grasping.
3377040	3381040	Paul was doing it too about the restless resting.
3385040	3389040	Relevance realization can come to the realization
3389040	3392040	that it itself is irrelevant.
3393040	3396040	That what is not needed anymore
3396040	3398040	is what relevance realization does,
3398040	3400040	which is optimally gripped.
3400040	3403040	Because relevance realization is how I get into relationship
3403040	3407040	to this being, to this being, to this being, to this being,
3407040	3409040	to all of these beings.
3409040	3412040	But when I want to be in relationship to the ground of being,
3412040	3415040	I have to give up relevance realization.
3415040	3419040	I have to get to a state where I give up
3419040	3424040	that most fundamental human need to grasp.
3425040	3427040	And it's hard for us to think of it.
3427040	3430040	This metaphor is the comprandra.
3430040	3433040	This is the metaphor for getting it, for understanding.
3433040	3436040	But I won't understand, I can't write.
3439040	3443040	But then you get what you really want.
3444040	3448040	You get the place where you have the stance.
3450040	3454040	Towards being, towards the grounded being,
3454040	3458040	towards the no-thingness behind and within.
3458040	3461040	Maximus has this great thing, right?
3461040	3463040	I really love it, where he says,
3463040	3467040	God is inside of everything but not enclosed.
3467040	3470040	God is beyond everything but not excluded.
3471040	3474040	You can't get that with a graspy mind.
3474040	3477040	You can't get that with a graspy mind.
3477040	3480040	It's inside.
3480040	3483040	I don't have it, it's outside.
3485040	3487040	I'm sorry, this is exciting to me.
3487040	3489040	You're all just sort of here.
3489040	3494040	But look, this is like, when I did Lexio on it,
3494040	3498040	it's like, God is inside everything but not enclosed,
3498040	3500040	not imprisoned.
3500040	3502040	God is beyond everything but not excluded.
3502040	3508040	And I kept going, how do I get there with a grasping mind?
3508040	3510040	You can't.
3511040	3513040	You can't.
3514040	3517040	When you grieve up all your grasping,
3517040	3521040	you give up the nexus center point of all the grasping.
3521040	3523040	You get opened up.
3523040	3526040	I think it's a kind of deep depth,
3526040	3528040	like Jonathan was talking about,
3528040	3530040	with the possibility of a resurrection.
3530040	3534040	If we have the stance to the ground of being,
3534040	3537040	such that we can really live with,
3537040	3543040	be along with how it shines in and withdraws,
3543040	3547040	then we have the possibility of a fundamental reorientation
3547040	3550040	and a new existential stance in the world,
3550040	3552040	which is badly needed right now.
3552040	3556040	Because all of the Cartesian things that we've gloried in,
3556040	3558040	well, look at how much I can calculate
3558040	3560040	and how I can paint and I can write poetry.
3560040	3564040	That is all going to be challenged very soon.
3569040	3575040	But this, this ability to enter into that axis-Mundi stance
3575040	3579040	towards the ground of being that liberates me
3581040	3585040	from the grasping so that I am in this deep,
3585040	3588040	right, Ratio, Ratio religio,
3588040	3593040	that is always available to you no matter what.
3595040	3601040	You long for home because we are woven with
3601040	3604040	the nesting of the home range,
3604040	3607040	the home base, and the hearth,
3607040	3610040	with the fire logos at the center,
3610040	3612040	the hearth and hospital.
3612040	3614040	We long for that.
3614040	3616040	We long for it.
3618040	3622040	But we're in a place where we need to recognize
3622040	3625040	what we are actually seeking.
3626040	3632040	We're seeking to belong, to orient, and to transcend.
3632040	3636040	And the right relationship with the ground of being
3636040	3641040	will give you those functions in a way that doesn't bind you
3641040	3644040	into that perpetual vacillation
3644040	3648040	between trying to find it retrospectively in the past,
3648040	3651040	trying to find it prospectively in the future,
3651040	3654040	but finding the common law, the through line,
3654040	3656040	that binds them all together.
3656040	3659040	Thank you very much for your time and attention.
3672040	3674040	Thank you, John.
3674040	3677040	We're actually going to move quickly into our discussion.
3677040	3679040	We have half an hour left before dinner.
3679040	3681040	So just take two minutes, get a drink,
3681040	3684040	use the washroom, and we'll get up, sit up.
