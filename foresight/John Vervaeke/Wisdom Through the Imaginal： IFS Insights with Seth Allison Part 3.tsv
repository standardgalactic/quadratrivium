0	4000	Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Raveke. I'm excited about this one.
4640	10960	This is a third episode with Seth Allison and we are doing this ongoing discussion about IFS work,
10960	18800	parts work in general, ally work, issues around the functionality, the phenomenology, the ontology,
19840	25600	issues around what's dangerous and what's safe. And we have a few more things we wanted to talk
25600	30880	about. We didn't really talk about exiles last time. I want to talk about that a bit. But before
30880	38160	we do any discussion, I'm going to let Seth quickly reintroduce himself and then Seth propose
38160	43520	something and I'll let him make the proposal on air. And I've agreed. So I'm going to turn things
43520	55280	over to Seth. Hi, John. Thank you very much. It's really great to be back again. And I just want to
56560	66000	begin by saying I appreciate that, although I said in our last conversation that I'm sure Dick
66000	76480	Schwartz is not watching, it turns out he was. And he reached out and just had a lovely correspondence
76480	85040	with him. And primarily it was a lot of praise for our discussion and appreciation that we're
85040	93440	doing this publicly. He did offer a very helpful couple of corrections. The first one is the IFS
93440	103760	concept of self being kind of a smaller self embedded in a bigger self. So the seed of consciousness
103760	111280	that we've talked about is kind of the personal essence of a larger self that is involved.
111280	113760	There's a functional relationship between those two. Okay.
115600	122720	Yeah, sort of self and self. I guess capital S might be the interior personal self and all
122720	134240	caps as ELF would be a larger self, probably perhaps similar to Jung's concept of self.
134240	140160	Yeah, I would say the seed of consciousness is the I in the I me relationship of James.
140160	143680	And then the self is something like the ground of the psyche, Atman.
144800	153040	Very good. Yeah, I love that language. I love that language. The other thing, which maybe we'll come
153040	161120	back to, we've been talking about your experience with Hermes and guide and guides is a term that
161120	169360	they use in IFS. I misspoke and said that guides were a part of the internal personal system.
169920	174960	In other words, a different form of part. Very helpful correction to say that is not,
176000	182720	it is transitive. Oh, that's important. Well, can you please? Very important for both of these.
182720	187440	The first one, yeah, I get the second one is, Oh, could you please thank him for these corrections?
187440	192160	I think that's wonderful to know that he concedes of the guides as transjective in nature.
192160	198560	That means there's a potential deep integration between IFS and ally work, at least the way
198560	208320	I'm interpreting ally work. I think so. I think they are exceptionally compatible.
209520	218720	And as we may have mentioned before, but Dick does the forward to Falconer's most,
218800	229440	think most recent book, the other. Yes, I have that. Yes. And it is, I really appreciate the
229440	236480	forward he wrote because he expresses his reluctance to talk about the topic. I think as we talked
236480	246320	about Dick's bio before, it's very important to remember that the experience near focus that he
246320	252960	is maintained with such discipline, actually, as he also tries to avoid being alienated from the
252960	260960	academy and the mainstream. And so he was very hesitant to go there publicly, although I think
260960	267840	that the idea of guides and the, by the way, the, which is fascinating this, the Falconer's book is
267840	274640	primarily about kind of the other end of the continuum, which would be they call unattached
274640	281200	burdens. I think in Christian tradition, we might call it the demonic, but across cultures,
281200	288880	this is has many different names. But it is not a part of the system, much like the guide is not
288880	294240	a part of the system. So there's kind of a distinction between daemons and daemons, if I can put it
294240	302160	out. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I wanted to make sure we noted that that is now formally
302880	309120	that's an amazing theoretical move. I, from what you said, it sounds like he appreciates the work
309120	313520	we're trying to do. Because I am, of course, trying to integrate this with cognitive science
313520	319120	while being respectful and doing participation in the experience near aspect of all of this.
321280	328000	He expressed gratitude and appreciation, which and certainly did not have to reach out. So it was,
328960	334000	I was, I was touched by it. And so I think, I think actually that
335280	343280	this is a part of what we are doing is very congruent with his, I would go so far as to say,
343280	351360	you know, his larger mission that he feels tasked with to bring inner work, a model, we're going
351360	360000	to talk about safety. And I think one of the things I'll propose to you is that IFS represents
361360	370960	maybe the safest mainstream technology we have for exploring for interception and the exploration
371600	376960	of different levels of consciousness and reality, where there it's, it's opening
377920	388560	a, the just degradated imaginal space that our culture has just abandoned. And I think doing it
388560	397440	in a way that is not only powerful, but responsible. So I, you know, I, I think this fits really well
397440	403520	with the larger mission. I think that's true. And when we talk about that, and we talk about
403600	407840	corresponding dangers, this is again, where I'd like to talk about the Socratic shift,
407840	411920	the shift into the dialogical self as opposed to the monotonic, monological,
413360	420560	monophasic, monostage self, although all the monos that have afflicted us and created what
420560	425760	Charles Taylor's called the buffered self. And there's probably historical reasons, the collapse
425760	431360	of the church as an institution, Protestantism, et cetera, the scientific revolution, the self
431360	437360	had to be really buffered and protected. It couldn't remain as porous as it was. But now
437360	444160	that adaptive stance has become maladaptive, and it's suffocating us and strangling us off
444160	448880	from reality. And so I want to sort of explore that possibility.
448880	462400	I, so we've, we've talked leading up to this about doing a session here that you will have the,
463440	471840	the right certainly to make public or private, which I'm very excited to do. And your nervousness,
471840	477360	I agree, I think it confirms that it's a good idea. And I feel, I feel a degree of anxiety too,
477360	483280	but I'm very excited to do that together. It is such an opportunity to
485360	491280	show the model in a way that can only really, you can't really get a lot of this without seeing it.
492640	499680	And so I think it would be a great service. That being said, I have so much that I've written
499680	506560	down about the topic we're currently talking about. So maybe I could throw some things out to you.
507360	513440	Some of which are going to be your own words, because I really enjoyed and want to refer people
513440	518800	to conversation you did. And I'm forgetting their last names, but it was Michael and Michael.
518800	521360	Michael Martin is one of them. I forget you and Michael. Yeah.
522880	528320	Yes. And it was really great. So I'd like to give some highlights, but also make sure people.
532320	536400	Great. So I want to start with some quotes that are right along the lines of what we're talking
536400	545280	about with Western culture. And these are taken from Faulkner's book. So he quotes Bernardo-
545280	549280	Yeah, I'm going to be talking to Bernardo about all of this, because he has a daemon that he
549280	555600	regularly works with. Yes. Yeah. Great. Right. And he says that we're in the dark ages of materialism
555680	567760	and behaviorism. And then I think it's George, or perhaps Bernjanos. You understand absolutely
567760	574400	nothing about modern civilization unless you first admit that it is a universal conspiracy
574400	583360	against the interior. And this makes me think of the work that you're doing,
583360	590640	which I wanted to help people perhaps understand the intersection of the pursuit of wisdom with
594720	602800	the work of the imaginal that we're exploring here. And the proposal here is that the imaginal,
604640	610000	as a way of gaining information and wisdom, is crucial to rationality.
610160	616880	And I've been making that argument. I appreciate Corban's how the imaginal is the mystical.
618240	623120	But I think the imaginal, like many other things, like flow and insight, is on a continuum where
623120	629520	there is the mundane of the imaginal that is in our everyday experience. The experience of the
629520	634160	introspective space inside our head, that's imaginal. There isn't a literal space there,
634160	639200	that makes no sense. But it's not just fictional, because it actually gives us genuine access to
639200	644240	our cognition and affords metacognition and rationality. So it's neither literal nor fictional,
644240	648160	it's imaginal. And that's just part of your everyday ability as a rational agent.
650560	654960	That, and I'm looking for it here, and it's one of the poets
656880	661840	talked about the secondary imagination and the primary imagination. And I think you're referring
661840	667520	to the secondary imagination. Coolridge had a distinction between fancy and imagination,
667520	672000	where fancy is just where you're just playing with. But imagination was the imaginal very much, yeah.
673520	680960	Right. And I think a quality of that is that it is a dialogue, that it is relational.
680960	685360	There is a degree of activity and engagement, not just a passive self.
687360	695840	So like Jung's concept of active imagination is not fantasy. It's this, the liminal space between
695840	701040	where consciousness interacts with the unconsciousness. He called it, I think the psychoid space where
701040	710160	things are crossing over through the archetypal. So I think Falconer says that we are, we need to
710160	718960	learn how to navigate the inner world to increase interoception, right, which is the looking in,
718960	727440	the study inward, our ability to see and interact and the interact part is key with our inner world.
727440	731680	So there's this, is he using this distinction? It sounds like it's close, but I want to make
731680	738400	sure I'm not smuggling in in equivocation by not excavating it. So in cog size psychology,
738400	743040	introspection means where you go into that space where you can do like mathematics in your head
743040	747840	or picture a sailboat. Interoception is your awareness of your body. Like when I ask you,
747840	752480	how's your right big toe doing? And you can go, it's okay. That's interoception. So it's very
753680	760480	somatically, functionally oriented interoception. Introspection is much more cognitively,
761840	767520	you know, I don't know what to call it, more and more cognitively oriented. I'll just say that right
767520	773920	now. I love that you're bringing it to the body and somehow it also connects to,
774720	779600	and it's tricky to tease out, but like being embodied in the psyche.
781440	786400	Go ahead. What are you going to say? Body, just what they are, they do overlap and there's a
786400	793200	liminal space where you can't tell which is which. And both introspection and interoception have an
793200	800320	imaginal quality to them. Introspection, very high imaginal. The interoception is closer to
800800	804560	detection, but there's still an imaginal element to it because you're still doing predictive
804560	809360	processing. You're still taking little samples and imagining the whole from them, all that stuff.
812160	819680	Great. Great. So the general sense here, I wanted one more quote for you is John Keats.
820720	828320	When a man is capable of being in uncertainty, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching
831200	836640	after fact and reason, he calls this negative capability.
838320	841920	I think the romantics at their best were discovering the imaginal.
841920	846480	I think the romantics at their worst were not realizing the deep interconnections
846480	852320	between the imaginal and the rational. Which brings me to danger.
852480	858640	There was a great quote. Where is it here?
863280	868560	Yeah, this was in Faulkner. The ability to become absorbed in our inner world is much
868560	876880	like fire, a wonderful servant, but a dangerous master. So I want to kind of move in a little bit
876960	886880	to some of your work. And I'm going to kind of frame this a little bit from just pulling out
886880	894400	some of the things that I think are interesting. So a little context with the meaning crisis.
894400	899120	These are just sort of domains. You've called it a wisdom famine.
899440	911040	I am adding to that the degradation of our imaginal faculties, an atrophy of our spiritual
911040	917360	musculature, a disconnection from nature, but also from our embodied selves,
918320	921920	a loss of relational and communal resources and embeddedness,
922720	930800	and a loss of our dialogical facility. I think I would just sort of put that as the context.
932800	939360	All of that together and brought into a kind of joint attention on the transcendentals and
939360	944720	through that the sacred. This goes back to the fear of the Lord as the beginning of all wisdom
944720	950560	kind of idea. Where I don't take that to mean fear. I take it to mean something like reverence.
951520	959040	That there is always a normative dimension to wisdom which is moving towards the true,
959040	964400	the good, and the beautiful. And that's rationality in the deep sense. The ability to be sensitive to
964400	969360	and reliably responsible to the call of the true, the good, and the beautiful. And then through the
969360	976640	true, the good, and the beautiful, ultimacy. An ultimacy that we can love. And so everything
976640	982240	you said, but held in concert together, sort of knowedically held in concert together,
982240	991280	directed towards the sacred in that way. Love it. And we don't have much
994000	1001200	in the way of structures, teachers, pathways, practices
1002080	1009680	that we can call on now. So this is how I frame you're working on developing an ecology of
1009680	1017040	practice and the work of the Verveki Foundation. How do we bring this back? Unfortunately, religion
1017760	1022080	for a lot of us has lost its credibility or lost its safety.
1023440	1029200	That was beautifully put. I just want to savor that. That was so succinct and captures
1030160	1036800	it. It's lost its credibility. If we include in that not just truth but relevance, people,
1038320	1044880	but also lost its safety for many people. Religion has, all the religions have piled up
1044880	1051440	sins and the good people within those religious legacies are taking responsibility for that.
1051440	1057360	I don't want to pretend that they're not. But nevertheless, there's trauma on one end
1057920	1062800	and it just doesn't work for me. I know lots of people who say, I want it to work for me.
1062800	1069040	I wish. I mean, in some ways, that's my case too. I feel like Corellian from Childhood's End,
1069040	1075040	I can always point people to their sacred home, but I will always be on the Silk Road kind of thing.
1076560	1083040	And so I just wanted to pause, Seth, and just open that up, expand that because I thought that was
1083040	1090640	beautifully put. Yeah, boy, that what you just shared resonated very deeply for me.
1095840	1099280	In fact, these conversations have caused me to dive into,
1102160	1106240	for lack of a more precise term, and I need something that holds all of this. I'll just say
1106240	1116240	spirituality in a way that I wasn't sure I would ever be able to again. I grew up, I think,
1116240	1124080	we both grew up in conservative Christianity. For me, it was evangelical Christianity and
1124480	1136640	some of the splits and the disavowed elements of humanity that I grew up with there,
1137920	1144960	I found deeply wounding and even traumatizing. And my psyche has been so bent and twisted around
1145600	1153200	some of the unhealthy interpretations of Christian tradition that I had to throw the baby out with
1153200	1161360	the bathwater for a couple of decades. And I don't know if I'll come back to it, but I'm just,
1161360	1168800	in the last couple of months, beginning to feel like, okay, I'm going to have to, I think I'm
1168800	1175760	called to a path back, but probably not to anything that I would recognize as Christianity from my
1175760	1184640	past. And actually, it feels like creating a new path and yet probably more than anything
1184640	1191440	discovering a very important thing. That's exactly what the Silk Road is. Silk Road allows,
1191440	1196560	nobody lives on the Silk Road, this is like C.S. Lewis's hallway Christianity, nobody lives in
1196560	1202960	the halls, people live in rooms, but you need the halls, right? Boy, I feel like I've lived
1202960	1209120	in a hallway for a while. Yeah, we're resonating on that. Yeah, I actually have a tattoo of the
1209120	1219360	word Lyman, the root of liminality for years. And hopefully I can look at that. I'm starting
1219360	1230000	to look at that as a period of time that so much had to be put through a crucible. Go ahead.
1230560	1235840	Well, for me, it's becoming the living symbol on of how I am being called.
1237280	1244640	Like people are traveling on the Silk Road that are seeking a place, a new home, but it also is
1244640	1249440	hopefully affording people to return to their homes and recover it the way Tolkien talks about
1249440	1253840	the recovery theory or the way an anthropologist goes to another culture and then comes back and
1253840	1260160	can see this same culture, T.S. Eliot, see it again for the first time kind of thing. And
1261440	1267920	the Silk Road will be the Silk Road if it is doing that. And I can't justify what I'm about to say,
1267920	1275360	so perhaps in one sense it's how I'm remaining imaginably faithful. I feel called that I need
1275360	1282160	to be in this liminal state right now because opening this up so that the legacy religions can
1282160	1286560	more deeply enter into profound, mutually transformative theologos. And this is already
1286560	1291600	happening. This is not something I am initiating. One of the functions of the series is to call
1291600	1297200	this up and show people and see all the resources and see what's happening. And the Verveke Foundation
1297200	1303760	is committing itself to trying to explicate this, foreground it, elucidate it, make it available
1303760	1308560	for people. And this comes out of discussions with Hermes. I've come from
1308560	1318720	grieving my liminality to, so I was always, in one discourse with Hermes, it's like,
1318720	1322800	it really bothers me that I'm almost. What do you mean? I was like, well, you know,
1322800	1327520	I'm sort of almost famous and I'm almost this and I'm almost this and almost this. And he said,
1327520	1331120	John, I don't know if I mentioned this to you. He said, first one thing, he said,
1331120	1334240	well, that's great because almost famous means you can interact with the famous,
1334240	1339840	but you're protected from the temptations and corruptions. And then we return to this again.
1339840	1343840	And I said, there's still something. And it was like, yeah, because you don't get it. You need to
1343840	1349520	be almost because a traveler is almost. You need to travel the road. You need to be almost right
1349520	1355040	now. Don't know what the future is, but right now you need to be an almost. You need to accept it.
1355040	1360080	That is your calling. That is what you need to be and you need to do. And when it moved to that,
1360080	1369440	it was like, and I was and I was really in a tough place because and I've had one conversation.
1369440	1373200	We're going to publish a private one and then public one. We're going to publish and doing
1373200	1382560	another one with Jordan Hall. Jordan Hall's conversion really impacted me. There was a
1382560	1390320	lot to sort through there. And I mean, part of it was, you know, a feeling of abandonment.
1390320	1396960	He and I had been brothers on this path and he suddenly had found a home and I felt, right?
1398080	1403120	But of course, I love him as a friend and I want the best for him. And we're trying to see,
1403120	1407680	does his pro does his current project and my projects, do they still can they still
1408480	1414320	enter into Deologos with each other? It looks like it is. But I needed that inner work. I couldn't
1414320	1419120	just do the outer discussion with Jordan. I needed that inner work to get, ah, this is where I have
1419120	1425120	to be right now. He's where he needs to be. I have enough faith in him that that's the case.
1425120	1429120	But I need to have faith in myself that this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.
1429120	1434000	And that also went into a good conversation with Christopher Master Pietro. So you get this sort
1434000	1439600	of thing happening that's inner and outer kind of like union synchronicity, not as, you know,
1439600	1443520	pronounced, but it's that sort of inner and outer worlds are sort of really talking to each other
1443520	1450640	really well. So I just wanted to relate that that that that and I'm not I'm not saying that this is
1450640	1457040	your call at all. I'm just saying for me, I appreciate and I hear the pain in your voice
1457040	1466560	because and I know the pain and there is a longing and I hope that my work can help people of good
1466560	1474320	faith who genuinely are experiencing that longing both within and without a legacy religious home.
1474320	1479920	That is my that is what I want to do. That is what I am committed to do because I think this
1479920	1483840	advent of the sacred that is happening right now and I think part of what we're talking about that
1483840	1489520	is exactly the expression of the advent of the sacred. I think that is what is needed
1489520	1492640	for everybody who wants to be on the Silk Road.
1501680	1507520	Thank you. Thank you. We share something deep and it's important to integrate and it's also
1507520	1513200	important to differentiate because that allows for reflection and mutual transformation.
1513200	1520000	That's that's why I wanted to do that. Thank you for watching this YouTube and podcast series is

1537520	1544160	If I could take a risk to to meet you there. I think I've told you this. I can't remember
1544160	1551200	if I it was on camera or off, but I actually have a Hermes tattoo on my ankle and so
1553600	1557040	it felt quite synchronous to me when you started sharing and
1557120	1569600	the the grieving that you mentioned, to me, part of entering liminality, which I did not choose to
1569600	1576800	do and I don't know that any of us would ever choose to do it, was the grieving literally
1577520	1584640	and figuratively the many-leveled grieving of the loss at home. Yes, yes, and
1587840	1596640	but the learning to live in the discomfort that Keats is talking about, to me the metaphor that
1596640	1604800	helped the most was that I am now exhausted and can no longer row this boat. I have to put the oars
1604800	1614960	in and begin to trust a current and I have no choice about it. So I will see where the river goes
1614960	1621840	and I will spend my time trying to look at the shore and what's passing and that begins to develop a
1621840	1635360	stance of participation without the ego doing all of its work and that could not, I could not
1636400	1645920	learn that at the pace I wanted to. It was a slow letting go over and over again and it did,
1646640	1654000	you know, I not only dealt with depression but you know the the movement into addiction and then
1654000	1662720	out of addiction was really the beginning of awakening of spirituality as it is for so many
1662720	1668240	millions of people. What capitalism has come up with this wonderful way for creating pervasive
1668240	1674640	low-grade addiction through the salience, the salience manipulations of social media and
1674640	1681680	advertising, etc. I'm not sure how low-grade it is anymore. I think we're just habituated to it.
1681680	1685920	Yeah, it's killing people so it's in one way is very high-grade. Yes, you're right.
1687040	1697360	Yeah, well and it is absolutely crushing the meaning in our world and our access to our inner
1697360	1706080	life were consumed by dopamine addiction that just consumed by it. So thank you. It's wonderful
1706080	1716160	to connect on this deeper level. Well, when you said that about the river, so there's a song,
1716160	1721840	it's a little bit cheesy but I really like the song Moon River and I came to was the line,
1721920	1727040	you know, up beyond the river's bend, my Huckleberry friend and that kind of shared sense of
1727760	1731840	I'm in the same place with you. I don't know what I don't know what's around the river's bend
1731840	1737760	and I've stopped trying to plan what it's going to be and I'm going to, you know, the Buddhism,
1737760	1744160	I'm going to enter the stream. I'm going to do it carefully but I'm going to enter. But that's the
1744880	1753280	that's the that's the conversion spirit. That's the movement of the ego and the dropping into
1754480	1764640	a different eye position. And it allows in IFS that allows access to the exiles that have lost
1764640	1771840	so much or that are carrying grief and pain that must be let go. So well, I think IFS,
1772720	1777600	we're going to get to what an amazing tool it is for spiritual work.
1780640	1788160	Man, I hate to jump back up, you know, but I do want to just a couple more pieces here.
1788160	1793520	By the way, I think the facility, I mean, we're doing in and out and that's good, but I think
1793520	1797840	jumping up and down, you need you need practice with that too, because you don't want it to be
1797840	1804080	jarring. You want it, I talk about Theoria and theory, they need to flow. That's another
1804880	1808640	tearing that we have to sew back together and heal.
1810480	1815360	Well, I've always thought of it as intellectual scaffolding that the manager,
1815360	1820480	manager parts of me that are hyper rational, which are really just very fearful.
1821440	1828640	They, they, they, they really need the map quite, they need it badly in order to relax. And so it
1828640	1835200	isn't, it is important. So let me just throw some things out or actually just repeat them and mirror
1835200	1843280	them back to you because these are your thoughts. The hermeneutics of experience, the ways in which
1843280	1851360	reality is disclosed to us. You, you talk about four dimensions of cultivating wisdom, the
1851360	1855680	dialogical, the imaginal, the mindful in the embodied. Do I have that right?
1856240	1861200	Yes. That's correct. Dime. Yeah. Did what work with that with Nathan Vanderpool? Yes.
1861200	1869520	I, I love this. And it, it, those almost act in my mind as, as the categories that we can use as
1869520	1875840	safeguards as we enter into spiritual practice. They're all domains in which we can cultivate
1876400	1882240	being reasonable, right? Looking for self deception, properly proportioning our salience,
1882240	1885440	taking the right perspective, assuming the right responsibility and role.
1886240	1891760	They are all ways in which we can bring reasonableness to bear on what we're doing.
1892560	1901280	So let me read some more of your thoughts to you. So I want to set the context again that we're
1901280	1907760	entering a period with psychedelics in particular, but also the field of psychology coalescing around
1907760	1918000	a dialogical self that altered states, experiential modalities, psychedelics, these are profound
1918000	1922960	opportunities for confronting the meaning crisis as we, as we set it up earlier in this
1922960	1930080	conversation. I'm going to assert that our primary problem here with these experiential
1930080	1937840	learnings is that we lack structures to hold the process of integration, not, not the doing,
1937840	1942240	but the after the integration. I think the integration is important. The integration is
1942320	1948560	important. It's, it's, it's more important actually than the experience itself.
1949520	1954400	That's what I meant to say. It is more important and the integration is in both of those dimensions
1954400	1959360	again. How well does it integrate with many domains broadly and deeply in your life?
1959360	1964960	How well does it transform many levels broadly and deeply of the psyche? That's the integration
1964960	1971520	and you are absolutely correct. Our culture gives us freshest little on both of those and even more
1971520	1976720	importantly, not only both of them, but how they are properly coordinated and speak to each other
1976720	1980880	in a self-correcting fashion. Oh, this is going broadly and deeply. Yeah, but it's keeping me
1980880	1986640	locked in this one level of psyche. Oh, that's, oh, it's going so much inside of me. Yeah, but it's
1986640	1995280	not transferring into your life. Think about that, right? So that, so the, what the poet and the
1995280	2004960	artist do is they, they have the equipment and the musculature to dive deep the canaries down in
2004960	2012560	the coal mine of the psyche, but to excavate and bring back for us. And I think, you know, my experience
2012560	2019360	with Psychedelics is, it gets you down there. It gets you down there, but the challenge of
2019360	2027200	bringing it back up is, is profound. It's easy to take psilocybin. It's not difficult. It is very
2027200	2034080	difficult to bring back what you learn and to integrate it. I agree. And in our culture, again,
2034080	2039680	super salience of the intensity of the experience that can be consumed, very little attention to
2039680	2048000	the cultivation of virtue. Right. So you have these two axes of intensity, right? We talked about this
2048000	2056640	back in our attachment talk of the COGSI processing, but the linear integration of if this, then this,
2056640	2062880	then this. And so the bringing this and this together is hard work. You need a framework.
2063760	2070400	And it cannot be done. It can't be done alone. And so whether it's the intellectual framework,
2070960	2078480	or even better, is a relational, dialogical framework in community, I think is the safest way
2078480	2082560	to proceed with this stuff. And the most I call it a sapiential framework, because I don't,
2082560	2087200	I think the word intellectual, it's the right word if we use it the way the Neoplatonist used it
2087200	2094800	for noesis, but we don't use it that we sapiential wisdom. It's an actually word,
2094800	2098960	it's an archaic word, but I'm trying to bring it back because we need an alternative word to
2099040	2105680	both intellectual and spiritual. And this word, I think is, it is a real word.
2107760	2111760	I'm going to add it, I'm going to add it to my verbate dictionary that I'm beginning to write.
2113360	2117120	So let me, let me give you some things that you said with Mike and Michael that you laid
2117120	2127440	this out really well. You quoted or summarized Drew Highland, Platonic scholar. We are simultaneously
2127440	2136000	finite and capable of transcendence. If we embrace our finitude, or if we only, sorry,
2136000	2142160	if we just embrace our finitude, we fall prey to despair and servitude. Love that.
2143280	2150080	So I think that's our current state in many ways. And then we have, I think in some hyper-religious
2150160	2158240	communities, we have the opposite. If we just embrace our transcendence, we fall prey to inflation
2158240	2162880	and hubris. By the way, it's not just in religious communities. There's a real danger in
2162880	2167600	psychological. Oh, totally. Totally. People think they become the voice of God. Yes, I know.
2168960	2175760	Yeah. So that's the extreme of inflation and hubris. If we hold them together in tension,
2176080	2183360	tonos, we will properly realize our humanity. I want to say that again. If we hold them together
2183360	2188960	in tension, our finitude and our transcendence, we will properly realize our humanity.
2189600	2199360	The middle path is to live in tonos. And I think your work is, is that, I think that's a wonderful
2199360	2208080	summary of, of what I am experiencing in your work as being aimed at. So here's, here's how
2208080	2215360	I think you framed the opportunity at this point in time in our culture. Or the challenge
2215360	2220320	which you said earlier, how do we metabolize mystical experiences or experiences of the
2220320	2228480	numinous, right? So you said opening to other dimensions of cognition in the psyche is epistemically
2229120	2238720	and morally a pursuit that we are called to. There's this huge family of phenomena
2240000	2246880	and this scientific investigation into it, not just practices, but participatory knowing,
2246880	2254960	which I think feels scary. Proper, careful, rigorous, reflective study from the outside
2254960	2264480	and the inside. Love that. We have a moral, these are your words, we have a moral obligation to ask,
2264480	2270880	what is a proper framework to bring to bear upon these experiences so that people could metabolize
2270880	2278240	them and realize them as the cultivate, cultivation of virtue and wisdom. And I like this part,
2278240	2282960	and not spin them off into narcissism or inflation and go down rabbit holes of their own
2282960	2290720	personal magical medicine. I don't know, you spun that one off, it was great. I mean, there's the
2290720	2297040	idea of inflation and hubris, right? And you talked about the scientific gaze,
2298800	2306560	and Michael had concern about the scientific gaze, and you said it's not a dissecting gaze,
2307120	2314160	but the intention is to afford the flourishing of this practice.
2316880	2323520	So I thought I'd pause there and let you, I mean, do you want to reiterate any of that? I'm just
2323520	2330960	summarizing, I think the big picture. No, no. I think you've made judicious choices in so far as
2331920	2339120	they captured the gist of what I was arguing for. I don't have any significant revisions or
2339120	2346080	amendments to what you've brought up, other than the ones that have spontaneously been occurring
2346080	2356800	between us. I just, I'm happy this, I'm having this conversation, these series of conversations
2356800	2362080	with you, we get into Genuine Dialogos. I'm appreciating the relationship that's growing.
2363440	2369360	I just want to say that I think that is, like you said, that is a proper
2372080	2379920	safety framing of working with the numinists in an important way. Yeah. Yeah, thank you.
2380480	2387280	I had some hallmarks of safety, but I think we've covered a lot of it,
2387920	2395040	and I'm looking at the time and just wanting to make sure we leave space for a dropping in
2395040	2404720	and an embodiment of a practice of IFS, which you have courageously been willing to kind of join
2404720	2414480	me in this. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have that sense of calling. This is not what I'd
2414480	2423040	like to do, but I'm called. So please continue with what you want to emphasize. Well, I think
2423040	2428160	we're called together. I feel called to this too. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I have a very friend. We're
2428160	2439440	called together. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Very nice. So the way that I often ask people to
2439440	2449200	enter in is to close their eyes and to check in with their body. So if I will say this before we
2449200	2458560	start to the people watching that I would encourage them to bring curiosity and compassion.
2460480	2467760	You and I hold this energy together right now, but in some weird, unexplainable way, I think
2468480	2474080	the energy of the audience matters too. I think we're both going to be a little bit,
2474080	2482240	parts of us will be afraid. And we're going to try to, you and I will try to sit with that.
2482240	2487920	And I think the more we sit with those parts, the more others will be able to. And I just want to
2488480	2497920	voice my faith in that because I've seen that with you. Yeah, so let me walk you in and we'll
2497920	2505120	walk in together. If you close your eyes, check in first with your body. And in the spirit of
2506640	2514560	EFT, I want to just be responsive to any areas that feel tight or unsupported,
2515600	2520400	any stretching or adjusting that needs to happen. You want me to remark on that at all? Or do you
2520400	2526000	want me to just do it internally? No. Yeah, just internally. In fact, most of this
2527760	2533680	is your relationship to what's happening internally to you. And I'll guide you about when
2534880	2543440	to report to me. I'll just follow your lead. Yeah, so you check in and you're just noticing
2543440	2549600	right now. So one of the things that I like to do to get centered is I like to imagine that
2550640	2556640	my ears are like my eyes. And so as I take a deep breath,
2558720	2565840	just a cleansing sort of deep breath, I bring my attention to my ears and to the soundscape around
2568240	2576880	and John, I want you to just imagine that the soundscape is much like looking at a sunset or
2577840	2582880	a painting that you're picking up the colors and the details.
2586320	2593760	You may notice things outside of your office or cars or planes, or you may just notice silence.
2596480	2598400	And I'm going to ask you a trick question.
2599120	2607680	Um, focus on one of the noises, one of the objects that's moving through space and time around you,
2608880	2613280	and ask yourself the question, is that thing that I hear right or wrong?
2615360	2622720	And of course, it's neither right nor wrong. Is it good or bad? It's neither good nor bad,
2622720	2630720	it's just there. And the spirit that we're looking for is a spirit of observation, just noticing.
2634720	2639440	We're going to bring that same attention to your inner world now.
2641760	2644880	And I want you to just take a moment to notice what you notice.
2645280	2651280	Uh, parts may be up and about.
2653840	2663280	And parts communicate visually, images, memories, scenes. They communicate in the body with sensations,
2664400	2668000	emotions, and they communicate with words.
2668960	2671600	And then you may experience right away the presence of parts.
2673600	2679600	And I just want you before we move anywhere to just notice them and take a deep breath as if
2679600	2682800	you're breathing for the whole system, like a little bit of a gift.
2684800	2693600	And in a gentle inner voice, and if you'd like to place your hand on your chest,
2693920	2699920	I always enjoy using touch as a way of communicating, but you don't have to.
2702640	2706240	Allow your hand to be a symbol that says to them that you're here.
2707760	2711200	And in an inner voice, you can even say the words, I'm here.
2715760	2720400	I'm present. My hand is a symbol that I'm not going anywhere.
2721360	2727920	This is the attachment frame that you're available and you're present to all the parts that want to come.
2731040	2733920	And just notice how that feels before we go any further.
2736240	2740000	And I'm going to check in with you now and you can leave your eyes closed and your hands
2740000	2745280	where they are, or you can move and adjust. But just tell me a little bit about what you're experiencing.
2746240	2753600	I'm experiencing a presence that's very familiar.
2755440	2760320	It's the yeah, yeah guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all bullshit.
2761520	2765200	Yeah, you know, it's just going to be over soon. This is just a waste of time.
2766160	2774880	That that that voice that voice and trying to not be put off by its arrogance.
2776000	2778720	I'm trying to remain open to it.
2780000	2785680	And there may be an even another part that's put off by its arrogance.
2785680	2788720	I'm trying to just hold that aside for now. Let's ask it.
2789680	2795680	Just wait possible. I want to hear it. I want to hear more of this. Yeah, yeah, guy.
2798720	2801600	Wonderful, John. I can tell that you've practiced.
2803200	2808720	I have a yeah, yeah, guy too. And he's got a foot on the break.
2809600	2812560	And then there's another part it sounds like that has a foot on the gas.
2813520	2820880	And let me just suggest that we turn from the yeah, yeah, yeah guy for a moment
2821600	2824320	to the part that is a little frustrated with him. Of course.
2826240	2831840	Can we do that? Can you turn your attention here? And it helps. I was going to ask. It's over here.
2833680	2839440	But I can sort of feel me. I need the gesture, but I can feel me bringing it sort of center stage.
2840320	2846240	Wonderful. Now, just take a moment slowly to be with that part.
2847200	2852240	And the first question I want to ask you, as you notice it, is how do you feel towards it?
2852880	2853600	Do I feel?
2855920	2862640	Yeah, I feel it. Oh, there's kind of a blending. It's angry at arrogance. I can't tell that anger
2862640	2865120	is the parts anger or my anger at the park.
2865840	2871920	Perfect. So I want you to ask the angry part of you to just take one step back so you can
2871920	2879680	enter into dialogue with it. Is it willing to do that? Yes. It's going to step sort of over here.
2879680	2887120	It's not going to go far. It wants to watch. But it's going to yeah. It's it's giving me
2887840	2896080	a pro temp opportunity. I'll give you a bit of time. Before we pivot, I want you to say thank
2896080	2904880	you to that part. We want to stay with it. And before we leave it, I want you now to just ask
2904880	2912880	it a question of how is it here to help you? What is its job? And just notice what it says.
2913600	2920160	Don't analyze. Just listen. Yeah, it says I'm here to prevent you from
2920160	2921840	fucking up because of your arrogance.
2924640	2927840	Thank you. Yeah.
2930240	2937520	Would it be willing to soften with you if it knows that you're going to turn and deal with
2938400	2940400	that part so that it doesn't have to?
2943520	2946960	Would it be willing to trust a little bit? It's there's hesitancy.
2948480	2953920	But you know, does it make sense to you that it would be hesitant, John?
2954960	2963120	Yeah. Yeah, it does because there's this part here feels
2963280	2972400	something tremendous about around arrogance. And this part is saying, you know, that tremendous,
2972400	2980560	that takes you got to be careful about that. And you got to be very hard and fast reactive.
2980560	2987600	That's what the anger is for. React hard and fast because this is big, big, big. So that's why it's
2987600	2995440	like that. But it's it's there's a little bit of I'll give you a bit of time with this. That's
2995440	3003360	all I can get. Excellent. So thank you. Let's let's make sure we just say thank you. And I would
3003360	3009520	like to I'll let that part know if I could speak to it. I would say that that's all we need is a
3009520	3017840	little bit of space. And that I invite it to watch. And I can hear very clearly how important
3017840	3029520	its role is for protecting John. And if it could just agree to not flood you. For when we're trying
3029520	3034800	this, I would like to try an agreement that if it needs to get your attention, it would just ask
3034800	3042480	and not flood you while we're trying. Is that okay? Yeah, that's okay. It's as long as yeah,
3042480	3047840	as long as I keep my promise. It's still there's doubt, but there's willing there's a bit. Yeah,
3047840	3053920	of course. Of course, there's doubt. How could there not be? Right. So thank you. I want you to pivot
3053920	3061280	your attention back to the yeah, yeah, yeah part now. And I want you very right off the bat to just
3061280	3068800	notice how you feel towards farther away now. Yeah, so you notice a little more distance. And he's
3068800	3074800	sort of over here, more on the periphery. If I turn to him, he moves a little closer. But
3076240	3083920	yeah, he's sort of there now. He I don't know, he doesn't seem quite as powerful.
3084880	3093520	Yeah, so he's his intensity is coming out a bit. He's he's been de-escalated a bit just
3094160	3099440	just by having some space here. Yeah, I'm now more open to this me.
3101520	3108480	Yeah, good. Yeah, I do. Yes. Yeah. So could you stay with him? Yeah, yeah, sure. And
3108960	3116000	and bring some curiosity here, John. I want to listen to him and I want to understand
3116560	3123360	what it is he's worried about. Could you just ask him in here? That's easy. He's the yeah, yeah,
3123360	3129200	because right, he wants to dampen things down so we don't have to have all the he wants to make
3129200	3133840	things boring. So I don't have all the intense emotion of this other stuff. He calls it this
3133840	3141120	other ship. He's a little bit still. So he's yeah, well, I like him. He's salty. And he's direct.
3141120	3147440	And he's saying he's saying that he's essentially his job is to protect you from being flooded
3147440	3153360	by all this intense shit. This stuff. That's what he that's what he means. That's what he
3153360	3161280	means by bullshit. He means anything that triggers this in some way. Oh, this is great, John.
3161840	3166720	Can I what I want you to do is kind of like a therapist, reflect that back to him and just
3166720	3173520	say, do I have it right in your inner voice? Yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, yep, you got it.
3174560	3180160	Yeah. Okay. Good. How are you feeling towards him now? Kind of fun.
3182320	3188960	Yeah. Uh huh. You appreciate it, right? I do. Yeah. I used to get annoyed with him because I
3188960	3194480	felt he was just trivial trivializing things that were important. Oh, he didn't like it when I brought
3194480	3205840	that up. So now I'm, oh, I want to apologize to him. I want you in your inner voice to notice that
3205840	3214080	you have some sadness and that you feel for him and let him know as you apologize, let him know
3214080	3220240	what you feel towards him. Yeah, I'm just letting him know that I didn't treat him fairly. I'm sorry
3220240	3228720	for that. Yeah. He, uh, and how doing something important. Now I feel, I feel that I feel a little
3228720	3237680	bit of, I feel regret and a little bit of grief. Yeah. Yeah. Let him know. I am, I am. Yeah.
3238560	3248320	Yeah. He softens with that. It's like, almost like my grief is a water that's softening things
3250240	3250800	between us.
3254560	3258160	I'm going to share something I'd love to hear his response to this.
3260000	3263440	He hasn't felt an emotional bond with you
3264160	3269840	in a long time. And to know that his pain affects you and you feel pain
3271040	3279520	really feels reassuring and comforting to him. Yeah, that lands. There's, yeah, he feels
3282960	3289120	more trusting is all I'm getting. I can't make it clearer than that. That's right. Yeah. I think
3289120	3294320	the relationship between the two of you is healing a little bit at that moment where I realized
3294320	3299600	and it brought up genuine regret, even grief. That was completely unexpected.
3301840	3310720	Yeah. This is the, the relational component of IFS happening. It's very real. It's very real.
3310720	3317280	And it is embodied and you felt an emotion and you feeling that emotion for him.
3317600	3325360	He felt that. And the connection deepened and both of your bodies relaxed. I could see that.
3325360	3331600	Yeah. It's interesting. He, this is the part where I was talking to you about, about, I don't mean
3331600	3335920	it abstractly. There's, there's a capacity for self reflection. He's appreciating.
3338400	3343200	Oh, lovely. He's appreciating the capacity for self reflection.
3343360	3349040	Yeah. He's sort of, he's, so he's a little bit sorry too.
3351360	3356000	Hmm. Yeah, I see expressing that. Yeah, that's,
3357760	3360640	um, this is, we're hugging each other.
3362880	3364880	Hmm.
3365040	3369520	It's beautiful John.
3372160	3374400	Just telling that I'm, I'm telling him I really care for him.
3376560	3380560	Yeah. That's really beautiful.
3380560	3394880	He's wrestling with something. There's strong emotion coming up between us and
3395840	3400160	his grammar, if I can use that language is to try and resist strong emotion. So he's struggling.
3401200	3405040	Yeah. I'm just, I'm not, I'm just trying to just be with him like you are with a friend who's going
3405120	3408720	through something. I get the struggle.
3408720	3412400	Yeah.
3412400	3422080	Yeah.
3432560	3436560	I don't want to impinge because I feel like a lot is happening.
3437120	3441200	Well, he's going through a lot. He's like metabolizing. There's this,
3441760	3444640	this is this call to integrity. Like it's when the part,
3447120	3454640	yeah. Yeah. I want to invite you to just stay with him in whatever way you can,
3454640	3457280	whether that's visually staying close to him.
3457280	3463520	Yeah. We're just close and he knows that he's allowed to do this.
3463520	3474720	Good. So there are a couple of questions that you don't have to answer because there's a
3474720	3480320	connection that's happening that's more important, but you could ask him what he needs from you
3482160	3483280	and see what he says.
3483280	3486720	I know it's just stay with him. He says, just be with me.
3488800	3489200	Good.
3489200	3490080	Just be with me.
3490640	3491360	Do you feel you can do that?
3491360	3501760	Yeah. I mean, it's tricky because I'm finding it hard to find the point of discernment between
3502960	3506160	empathizing with his pain and bleeding into it.
3509040	3510960	So a little trouble with the boundary?
3514720	3520240	I'm afraid that I'm owning something that belongs to him or vice versa.
3522160	3528720	So, perfect, John. We're not going to leave him. He can stay connected to you,
3528720	3532160	even if it's just like holding a hand or just staying right by.
3533600	3538960	But I'd like you to pivot your attention from him to the part of you that's scared
3538960	3543040	right now. Scared that you're doing it wrong or scared that you're blending.
3543040	3543920	Right. Yeah. Yeah.
3544480	3548960	Yeah. That's rational man.
3549680	3549920	Yeah.
3551440	3555200	So rational man. Now, same thing as before.
3555200	3560640	Ask him to take one step back so you can dialogue with him and then take a moment to just take him
3560640	3572960	in and observe him. What does he want you to see? Just ask him what would you like me to witness
3572960	3574160	and see what he does?
3574160	3576640	Well, his initial response is there's not enough theory here.
3578160	3579920	That's what he initially says, right?
3580560	3584800	Of course. Of course. So theory is the way he keeps you safe.
3584800	3588240	It's not enough theory here. This is going off in all these directions.
3588240	3592240	And he's starting to do this very analytically. He's starting to list.
3595920	3599920	Yeah. So how do you feel towards this part?
3599920	3605120	I have a friendly relationship with him. That's why when he came up, it was funny.
3605120	3612320	He does a lot of good work for me. And I'm appreciative. I owe part of my job to him,
3612880	3621920	right? If he doesn't come into play, I can't do the work I do. So I like him. We like each other.
3621920	3627280	But he, yeah. But like I said, he's a little...
3627280	3627760	Can you...
3630880	3638080	I love the relationship you have and you feel a lot of self-energy with him.
3638080	3644000	It's a very, very good relationship. So I think he's just perhaps wanting to
3644000	3647440	touch base and check in with you. Can you ask him if he needs anything from you?
3647440	3650000	No. He just said what Seth said.
3652160	3660640	Okay. Great. I love his efficiency. Okay. So if it's okay with him, then we'll turn back to...
3660640	3662080	And now I'm not afraid either.
3662080	3664240	That's the part we were with. Good.
3664240	3670480	There's just... I'm still holding on to him over here. There's still this very localized though,
3670480	3677920	sort of processing, metabolizing, sort of grief, pain, reunion. That's still running over here.
3677920	3680240	That's interesting. It almost has a life of its own over here.
3682240	3686240	Yeah. The relationship continues even if you're not paying attention to it.
3687120	3692080	That's a great observation, John. So let's check in with him.
3693920	3696640	And is there anything he wants you to witness now?
3696640	3704400	He's crying. But he's telling me it's good. It's good. He's actually telling me not to get upset.
3705360	3706960	Which is interesting.
3709600	3712000	He's still trying to take care of you.
3712000	3718880	Yeah. He is. He still cares about me. And that's nice. And I tell him I really get the struggle
3718880	3724720	he's in. This is the core of who and what he is. His job. It's really clear. His job is to
3724720	3730480	prevent intense emotion, yet he needs to connect with me. And that has intense emotion attached
3730480	3736880	to it. And so he's like, I'm telling you. I'm telling him. Sorry, I switched to talking to
3736880	3744160	him directly. I get it. I really get it. I get what you're wrestling with. And I'm here. I get it.
3746560	3751200	So good, John. So good.
3761360	3768640	I'm going to just play a hunch and ask a question. And it could very well be no.
3770320	3779600	But would he be interested in going with you to a safe, secure, different place inside of you?
3780960	3781920	Yeah, he doesn't want to do that.
3783680	3786400	He wants to stay where he is. No problem.
3787280	3789520	He's on the edge of what he can handle.
3792320	3800400	Perfect. So I want to let him know, and you, that we are going to respect his boundaries.
3801120	3806240	And when he feels like he's at a point of saying, stop, that is totally what we're going to do.
3807120	3811840	All right. I've let him know.
3814080	3822720	Okay. And I'm just going to hold this space with you and allow that to take whatever course it wants
3822720	3823680	to take inside.
3829360	3830080	He's tired.
3836800	3845360	He's processing and bound up. He's tired and got that sense until now. He's really tired.
3850560	3857280	I find myself imagining that he's been great. He wants me to sit down too,
3857280	3859680	so I'm sitting down with him. He's really tired.
3860400	3865040	Does it make sense to you that he's tired?
3865040	3871600	Yeah. He's just been carrying this for a long time and then confronting with this on top of it,
3871600	3879360	sort of this self-reflective awareness. It's exhausted, really tired.
3880160	3886320	His job has been exhausting. His job has been exhausting, and he's telling me he's not upset
3886320	3893920	about it, but getting him to connecting with him is also exhausting. He wants it, but it's exhausting.
3899920	3902000	So he's been in a bit of a double bind.
3902720	3908960	That's exactly it. Boy, that landed, and he feels like he's struggling. He's been struggling against
3908960	3912960	that. That makes sense.
3912960	3915920	Yeah. There's a little bit. I can hear a little bit of intensity in there.
3916480	3916800	His voice.
3921840	3923200	Powerful for him to have that.
3924640	3928560	There's this image of almost like, I can't quite draw it with my hands, but there's this
3928560	3935040	rope, this twisting upon itself rope thing that's binding him and I and himself.
3936320	3939040	He's trying to articulate it with an image.
3941200	3942960	That double bind is exactly right.
3943120	3945760	Good.
3950960	3954240	Oh, I feel a lot of compassion for him right now.
3959280	3963200	He's smiling. What's coming up? When I said that, he smiled.
3967680	3970720	Oh, some of the negative affect is calming a little bit.
3973920	3981760	Yeah, it continues to calm.
3986320	3991200	Sort of settling in. He just wants to be with me, very calm and just be with me without all that
3991200	3992400	without all that craziness.
3993120	4009040	What I'm getting, John, is that maybe for the first time, it feels safe for him to be connected
4009040	4014000	with you and to not be scared of getting flooded by all the intense stuff.
4014640	4023520	Yeah, there's a bit of a sense of confidence. You said that it was the negative affect grows
4023520	4037440	a little bit, but it didn't go. It just went and it sort of hit that confidence that shared faith.
4039360	4041040	He likes that. He likes me saying that.
4044320	4058960	One of the things that is done in the IFS world is to, if possible, if he wants to,
4061680	4070720	where there was all that angst and fear and intensity, a space might clear in him
4071520	4074720	where he could take in calmness and confidence
4077120	4081120	and breathe that in and feel it. He wants to get up and move around a little bit.
4083680	4086880	Wonderful. He's sort of dancing.
4094160	4097280	It still hurts a little, but he's dancing.
4101520	4106400	Breathing in creativity and expression. He's returning.
4106400	4108720	He wonders what's next.
4111680	4118240	He's returning to play. Now that he's free of the job he wasn't supposed to have,
4119360	4129840	he can become embodied as a natural being that has its own organic nuclear agenda.
4131280	4131920	What does he want?
4131920	4134960	Well, I had to hold Rational Man off for a sec. He came in.
4136080	4138480	Sorry. I think I brought him in.
4140080	4143600	This needs a label. This needs a name. We've got to put some concepts on this.
4146160	4146960	I'll give you time later.
4149440	4153840	That's exactly right. He's going to come and get his turn in a minute.
4154400	4163200	He did. Like I said, he and I have a very good working relationship.
4164240	4167760	When he stepped back, again, even more calmness here,
4174880	4179280	he's considering, I don't know how to put this, so this isn't quite right, but
4180240	4183600	he's considering just putting down his job.
4185840	4188400	He's really open question. Is that possible?
4191600	4191840	Yeah.
4195200	4196480	So he's contemplating it.
4197840	4200400	I said, I think it is. I'd like to help.
4200960	4215280	Yeah, he's really, he's in that state of, huh, that's what he keeps sort of doing,
4215280	4218880	huh, maybe, and he's still dancing around too.
4220320	4224080	He dances and he pauses and he does that, huh, he does that, huh.
4230720	4233280	He's feeling into it.
4234000	4236080	Yeah, he doesn't want to rush, that's for sure.
4238720	4240160	Well, that makes sense to me.
4240160	4241680	Yeah, me too. Me too.
4242800	4243280	Yeah.
4250800	4257920	I just, you wanted me to forgive him. I do it. Get it.
4258640	4260080	Yeah. Okay.
4268800	4269120	Okay.
4277840	4279440	He really needed to hear that.
4288880	4313280	Yeah, as he's considering the possibility, he's sort of sharing with me, see all the places in your
4313280	4317680	life where I was this trivializing thing.
4323440	4327760	He wants to make sure that I'm fully appreciating his job, what he's been doing.
4329920	4332480	And he's wondering if I, yep, that's so important.
4332480	4333440	He's wondering if I can
4336160	4340080	really accept that and forgive him to that scale.
4344000	4348880	Yeah, I really can get it.
4357920	4364880	Well, he believes me, but he's still not fully settled.
4365760	4368480	Now he's sitting down again. He wants to sit with all of this.
4373920	4384960	Are we getting a thing from him? That's enough for me. I don't want to do any more.
4384960	4385200	Yeah.
4387840	4394960	Well, he has done an amazing amount of work right now. Yeah, I mean, really amazing.
4395760	4405520	Um, this is a point where we can just remind him that you're not going anywhere.
4407680	4410400	And that he can reach you when it's on the door.
4412480	4417280	That's it. And we want to make sure we're clear about how we can connect with you if you need to.
4418960	4424400	Through your body, through emotion, but through words would be great too.
4425920	4427280	Yeah, I'm letting him know.
4429520	4429840	Good.
4434080	4439120	So he's asking if I can just leave that little bit of energy running for him
4439120	4441920	so he can keep processing it. I said, that's fine.
4444480	4450320	Wonderful. And just, um, if it feels right to you, John, you could let him know that you'll
4450320	4452960	check back in with him later. I will. I'll check back in with you.
4453680	4454000	Okay.
4455520	4455920	You're doing.
4456960	4464160	And, um, you can say your goodbyes in whatever way you want to. And then when you're ready, come on back here.
4464160	4483120	There's, well, I've always found it powerful. That was very powerful. It, uh,
4485760	4490400	your expertise, your virtuosity was helpful. You often said something that
4491280	4495600	landed just beyond where I was, but landed well. And that was very helpful.
4498720	4506640	Good. It was pretty easy on my side too. In fact, the hardest part was just restraining myself,
4506640	4513680	because the work was going so quickly. And your system, I would say your system was
4515120	4517760	very ready to do that. So at the very end,
4521120	4525280	I had a sense of Hermes, almost like a translucent presence,
4525280	4528160	surrounding the whole thing, sort of saying, well done.
4532640	4534240	That was unexpected too. That just came.
4536560	4536800	Yeah.
4541360	4548640	John, thank you for your trust and, um, for allowing me to be with you.
4548640	4549040	Thank you.
4549120	4556480	Um, I'd like to take the opportunity to let rational man have his, uh, his time,
4557200	4560960	because there is a lot of sense making that could be powerful here.
4561600	4567840	But I don't want to do that at the expense of, um, the connection that you just established,
4568480	4571280	and the experience you're having in your body right now.
4571920	4574880	So maybe we start with just checking in on how you feel.
4574880	4583280	So I, really, really good. And then right here, this little tiny sort of running that's happening,
4583280	4588640	and it's him, uh, it's not, it's not pleasant, but it's not distressing to me because,
4589280	4593600	yeah, there's a moment of sort of friendship there. I could feel this is just the metabolizing
4593600	4598320	going on. Just metabolizing. You just keep checking in with me. And yep, I will. I will.
4599760	4604240	Uh-huh. That's great. That's great. It's, um,
4605200	4613840	I love your interception. So, um, well, you, you have, uh, really developed your ability to
4613840	4617120	stay relational and dialogical and present. Learned it from,
4618000	4619440	and embodied. Learned it from socrates, so.
4623040	4623840	Pretty good teacher.
4626000	4632960	Um, so I want to, um, take the risk and you tell me and interrupt me at any point if it
4632960	4641200	feels like, um, it's not going intuitively where you would like to be. Um, but I'd like to draw some
4641200	4646960	things out, uh, that we've been talking about, um, that, that I just witnessed, I think.
4648080	4657280	So the first thing I want to do is say that, um, uh, we encountered, uh, a couple of different
4657280	4666720	parts in there. Um, a rational man clearly is a manager, um, who is in charge of keeping things
4666720	4676400	safe. Um, and we also had this frustrated part that I think is a manager that, uh, seems to be, um,
4677200	4685760	also charged with keeping things safe. Um, and I think, I think we had a bit of a firefighter
4685760	4694080	there in the, uh, the bullshit detector who, um, both was trying to keep, in a manager way,
4694080	4700880	trying to keep you from being flooded, but also responding to the flood when it would happen
4701440	4707760	by kind of trying to cut it off and call it out. Um, and what happened is as, as you brought
4707760	4712960	what Schwarz calls self energy, which we, we first had to clear other problems, right?
4712960	4720000	We had to, we had to get them to give you space so that you could be with him. And people will
4720000	4724880	have noticed as soon as they gave space, we didn't have to do anything. You turned back
4725920	4731760	and the relationship field had changed. He wasn't flooding you and super close. He was a little
4731760	4739120	further. Your system was deactivated and you were present and curious. And the relationship
4739120	4745440	dynamics just took hold. And I would say this is where, from my perspective as an EFT therapist
4745440	4752640	and an attachment based psychotherapist, we watched a beautiful scene of attachment unfold
4753840	4761440	where it was nervous system to nervous system. And so what I was trying to draw out was that
4761440	4768560	connection that you felt emotionally to him. And I wanted him to see it and feel that your system
4768560	4776720	was connected to his. He felt pain. You felt sad about it. Yeah. And there's a natural. So
4776720	4782400	when we work with couples, primary affect, when it comes up, when I see my partner who I love and
4782400	4788640	my whole world depends on hurting, some kind of fear comes up in me and I want to make it better.
4789200	4795600	And I feel sad that they're in pain. That is trustworthy because that can't lie. That can't
4795600	4803120	be untrue. You can't have those automatic responses be feigned. And so that gave him an
4803120	4808400	opportunity to experience something that is truly trustworthy between the two of you.
4809600	4820560	And he began to soften. And as he softened, we had grief. But we also had the possibility of
4820560	4826960	something new emerging. And I agree with everything you said. But there's that there was and I wasn't
4826960	4835040	imposing it. There's that there's a Socratic aspect of him coming to try to live by the principle.
4835680	4840160	Like that's when he got into the double bind. That's a Socratic Aporia. Right. And he got into
4840240	4848320	Oh, oh, oh, oh, there was a ah, right. And that was that was I thought, I thought really important
4848320	4854960	too. And the part of me that didn't want to do to I like part of what I've been learning in my
4854960	4860160	practice is to stay with Aporia rather than try to and that's rational man coming in to try let's
4860160	4866640	get this come on. Like, and no, let's hold that back. Stay with the Aporia really stay with the
4866640	4870240	Aporia. Give it some autonomy, let it unfold as it needs to.
4872800	4878160	Or in this case, what I heard was he began to try to work with a symbol. Yes. Yes. Yes.
4879520	4886000	And that something needed to loosen and and kind of become
4888000	4891840	untied. I think he came to the possibility that emotions
4892800	4899200	are not inherently dangerous. It was that's that kind of realization and that he actually wanted
4899200	4906080	an emotional connection with me. And he was really I mean, yeah, so that is
4908160	4913120	No, no, no, please. For me, that was that was like that was a real that felt like a profound moment
4913120	4920800	because it was him like getting it. Like he was like it's like the existential confront.
4920800	4927360	He was confronted by, you know, a kind of inner contradiction. Like, no, no, I want an emotion
4927360	4934880	and it's not so it can't be that they're inherently bad. But my job is to dampen down
4935840	4944640	emotion. And that was the knot. And I felt that that and I found I'm, I'm, I'm surmising because
4944640	4949840	now we're doing theoretical reflection that my practice in dialectic of theologos of being
4949920	4954880	apophatic and staying with Aporia came in to help me there because it helped me also keep
4954880	4960480	rational man over there. And it helped me, okay, you need to I can't unravel this for you.
4961040	4966400	Right. But I can be here with you and say I'm going to support you and empathize with you as
4966400	4970080	you try to do, even as I'm saying that right now, this is getting calmer.
4971040	4982720	So in IFS, we'd say that's self-energy. That compassion, curiosity, courage, creativity,
4982720	4985440	calmness connected. That's the socratic spirit for me.
4987680	4992960	Well, and there are five, I always forget there are five P's as well as the eight C's. And I wrote
4992960	5002640	them down here. Patience, perspective, which I think is a lot of this, presence, persistence,
5002640	5011760	no, no, no, rational man, you know, playfulness. This is all, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think this
5011760	5017760	self-energy can be helped by people if they have a practice of internalizing a sage. I think that
5017760	5026240	would help concretize it so they can enact it better. So this is, this is the guide idea and
5027680	5033920	that your attachment with Hermes, not a coincidence that appears at the end as he is,
5034720	5040960	he's blessed. Very much. That was, that's the word. And that's the word. Exactly.
5040960	5045840	I feel a bit of happy right now.
5048480	5049120	Lovely.
5052640	5057840	Can I just, one thing that I really want to kind of draw out here is we talked about parts having
5057840	5069360	attachment styles. And I heard, primarily I heard in it, an anxious attachment style that
5071360	5079600	and the, the, oh, oh, was his dropping into security. Maybe for the first time.
5079600	5086240	I love this. I love the IFF and the attachment. I mean the EFT and the attachment. That's, oh,
5086240	5093520	it's so good. But John, listen to this. This is the definition in my mind of secure attachment
5093520	5098160	is about the ability to process emotion. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that emotion,
5098240	5104000	emotion is not a threat. It's data. Yeah, it's data. And you and he were learning to interpret
5104000	5110720	the data together. That it is not flooding, but it can be, I can actually feel it and use it
5110720	5116240	and symbolize it, feel it in the body, symbolize it in a way it can be understood,
5116240	5122640	be responded to, feel regulated, four steps to attach. That was beautiful. Feel it,
5123600	5132560	symbolize it often in language. Be responded to accurately in a way that works. Be soothed.
5132560	5139440	That repeated creates a secure attachment style. And that's what you were doing with it. Yeah.
5142160	5148480	He'd never done it, John. No, of course not. He'd never done it. Of course he had, right.
5148480	5154880	But you got, and we got to witness the transformation that like that kind of presence and love,
5154880	5158800	really. That brings sadness to me.
5162000	5168800	Did he never felt it? No. And we're, it's almost a sharing. I have,
5171040	5176160	I think my attachment style as John is one of anxious attachment. And that has caused me
5177040	5183280	a tremendous amount of loss and suffering and put relationships at risk. So that just came back to
5183280	5195200	me very powerfully. Of course. So I feel for him even more, but it brings up that sort of anxious
5195200	5203600	empathy around, yeah, I know how bad this could be. It also makes sense to me when you say that,
5203600	5212000	why he would be so curious and scared about your ability to forgive him. Exactly. That's exactly
5212000	5217600	right. That's exactly right. He knows it's cost you. Yeah.
5220720	5223280	Now that lands very deeply, very deeply right here.
5223440	5229680	But it's not his fault. No. Yeah, he gets that.
5235840	5243920	And this is why IFS represents one of the best technologies that we have in our endeavors
5244800	5254160	of dealing with the meeting crisis. And it's very exciting.
5257760	5263440	This idea of creating or not creating, sorry, accessing self-energy.
5264160	5269360	I use inventio. I use inventio, imaginal inventio. You're discovering and making,
5269360	5273440	and it's a mixture. It's inventio because it's transjective. It can't be either discovery or
5273440	5281680	making. It has to be inventio and it's imaginal. And in your experience, we have an even fuller
5281680	5290320	demonstration with Hermes coming as a transjective object that he brings the eight C's and the five
5290320	5297760	P's into the system in a way that maybe you couldn't access before. And that's the larger
5297760	5305120	self, kind of the, he's creating this bridge. I was going to say, I didn't, I didn't, I make a
5305120	5311360	difference between asking something from him and invoking his presence. I didn't invoke his
5311360	5316960	presence because I wanted to, and so I didn't do that, but I asked for his help in the practice
5316960	5319920	that I could come into it as authentically as possible.
5319920	5325520	And you did? Yeah.
5326880	5332960	I experienced Hermes as holding space there. That's where he was. And that's where he was in
5332960	5337440	the final image. He's like, there's, I don't know why there's sort of a hillside behind,
5337440	5345200	and he's on like, and it's that translucent figure. Yeah, very much. I didn't, I, yeah,
5345200	5350160	I didn't get that until you said it, but the translucency was a way of presencing the
5350160	5359360	transjectivity. Excellent. Excellent observation set. Ah, I love that. I love that. Yeah. Yeah,
5359360	5365920	the psychopomp, the movement through that he embodies a kind of liminal transitionality.
5365920	5371360	What was wonderful about that presencing is often when I'm working with him, we have to sort of
5371360	5377120	scrape away automatic projections going on to him, given to me by my fundamentalist past.
5377120	5382000	That wasn't there at all. This is one of the, this was like pure presence, and it was quite
5382000	5386960	wonderful, quite wonderful, beautiful, even sublime.
5390800	5398320	I think I'd point out one other thing that is really important, and that is that there was
5398320	5404800	such a strong relational element to the work between you and I, as we did this, and that
5407200	5413840	that was not work that, you know, you were doing by yourself, but it was in dialogue going this way,
5413840	5421920	and going internal, and maybe going this way hermetically. And I think that creates
5422880	5427600	a picture of safety that we can reference when we, we talk about encountering the
5427600	5434880	numinous as a way of kind of accessing wisdom, that it is, it is connected in all these directions.
5436800	5446000	And that feels, it feels like the container, you know, that's needed. Yeah. Yeah. That's
5446000	5451120	landing very deeply for me. And for me, I see it as containers within containers. This is the
5451120	5459360	container. And then it sits into a larger 4e neoplatonic framework. And like, yeah, there's
5459360	5464880	there's these nestings. And but they're not ossified and hard. They're like, they're like
5464880	5467520	cellular membranes. So
5470400	5480160	I had one other question for you about how old was he? He was a 25 to 30 year old man.
5482080	5486960	Okay, interesting. He got a little bit younger as the practice went on.
5489920	5497200	I was wondering about that because he had exile qualities. And we haven't talked about
5497200	5505440	exiles, but he was clearly carrying a lot of pain and exhaustion, guilt and anger and sadness,
5505520	5514080	a lot of like, the anxious attachment stuff that he began to release in his way.
5514080	5520720	It was interesting. I kind of wanted to go that way as John. But no, that was not,
5521680	5525280	that wasn't going to happen. That was not going to happen. He was, that's not,
5526080	5532640	it was, he needed, he needed to dwell. That's the word I was looking for. He needed to dwell here
5532640	5544480	for a while. I mean, reminds me dwelling at home. He needed to feel at home. Yeah.
5546880	5554720	Well, I know like 1115 was our hard stop or 1215 year time. You normally give me the last word,
5554720	5560000	but I'm wondering if you would like it. Yeah, let's break with that tradition just for this one
5560000	5568800	time. First of all, thank you for that. And I think the integrity of the practice as a container
5568800	5576480	and as a vehicle is both a container and a vehicle. I think that was apparent. It was
5576480	5584640	spontaneously there. I didn't have to force it. It had, it was Dow. It wasn't, right? And
5585040	5591120	it's important to,
5594800	5602880	important to share this responsibly. I agree with you. And all these
5602880	5609040	dialogical practices, I think, well, we'll talk about, I want to talk about them now.
5609040	5616800	I want to talk about the next one. What does that mean? Because I think they push on deeper frameworks
5616800	5621760	and, right? That's why I talked about the 4E and the cognitive, 40 cognitive science and
5621760	5628880	neoplatism because we're really challenging the buffered self. And I think, I think, and I don't
5628880	5633520	know how this works. So this is a question. I don't, I want to know how these, I'll use
5634480	5640480	a, a convoluted thing. I don't know how these cultural spirits interact with these psychological
5640480	5648000	parts. Like we've got inculturation towards the buffered self and we get social reinforcement
5648000	5653840	and salience incentivizing around it. And that's a deeply internalized machine that it's almost
5653840	5661040	transparent. And I think in practice, we, we press up against that when we're doing these
5661040	5669600	kinds of practices. But for me, I feel especially because I bring this whole framework of reflectively
5669600	5677520	trying to philosophically trying to challenge the monadic, monophasic, monological, monostage self
5677520	5686640	that it's, it's, it's very amplified for me. That sense, that deeper sense of what is it like?
5687600	5693920	And that didn't come up here because there was enough. But it's coming up now as I step back
5693920	5697120	from it. It's like, as it's percolating through my psyche, it's like, yeah, but
5699120	5704320	like, what is it to challenge that cultural spirit and challenge it in a way that integrates with
5704320	5707520	what's happening with these psychological parts? That's a question that I have.
5707680	5720640	So what I'd reflect is I feel like rational man. And is now, you know, we talk about, I think the
5720640	5731120	theme for today was that the imaginal is crucial to being rational. And he's picking it up. I feel
5731120	5739600	like this, this practice you just engaged in has clarified something for him that he now has
5739600	5742720	sharper questions. I think that's exactly right. I think that's exactly right.
5744560	5751200	Okay, Mike. Yeah, that's something. Thank you for all of this. And we'll set up another,
5752160	5758000	another episode because I do want to explore some of these themes around danger and framework
5758000	5762000	and cultural spirit versus psychological part. If I could just coin those terms as
5762000	5766880	the whole two things conceptually different for a while. Oh, yeah. And so I invite you to come back
5766880	5776960	for a fourth episode. Well, I tell you, yeah, I thank you. And I would love to.
5778800	5786400	It's, it's wonderful to dialogue with you. And it's a gift. And I'm very excited if you choose
5786400	5797280	to share it. I'm going to upload this. Wonderful. I know this may seem like a very shame less or
5797280	5805520	shameful plug. But because the spirit of this is to, you know, promote these practices,
5806880	5813600	we are going to offer the attachment workshop and the IFS workshop again through the foundation.
5814400	5819680	Coming up in April and May. Yeah, please. Everybody, you see what this can do. Okay. So,
5820320	5826080	you know, you've got an amazing opportunity with Seth. Please make use of it. I'm going to end
5826080	5833680	the recording here, Seth. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jeff.
