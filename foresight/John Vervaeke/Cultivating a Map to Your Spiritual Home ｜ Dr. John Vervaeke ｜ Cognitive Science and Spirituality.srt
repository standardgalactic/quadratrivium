1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
We're going to have John Vervakey speak to us now.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,800
He is the founder of the Vervakey Foundation and the Director

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,920
of Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,080
He's the creator of the acclaimed Awakening

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,040
from the Meeting Crisis and After Socrates series.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:33,120
Thank you. So, I have a choice here. I can give my talk or answer all of John's questions.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:49,480
All right. So, I'm changing this title slightly from in the program,

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,200
the Cognitive Science of Home Belonging to the Home Range Orienting from the Homebase

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:01,400
and Growing Up Around the Hearth Hospital. I chose the last one solely because it had

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,720
H's in it. No, it actually captured better what I wanted to talk about.

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,080
So, what I want to do is I want to make use of John A. Allens.

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,280
There's going to be two Allens mentioned, so I'll try to keep them clear, separate for you.

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,720
John A. Allens' book, Home, How Habitat Made Us Human.

14
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,640
And I want to trace out the evolution of home in three stages towards answering the question,

15
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,120
why do we long for home?

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,720
Those three stages is not a ladder, but a nesting, and of course, nesting is a kind of home.

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,760
But the three stages are the home range, the home base, and the hearth hospital.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:54,120
And I'm going to show how each is a stage in the shaping of cognition within 4e Cognitive Science.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,200
And then I want to talk about how that cognition is, I hope, plausibly exacted up into our spirituality

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,160
and then talk about domicile and quest in that context.

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:16,680
So, even before we were recognizably human, we were biological, our ancestors were biological organisms,

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,440
and there's been a revolution in biology around this that gives us an important aspect

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,400
of the first stage of the evolution of home.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,280
This is called niche construction.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,600
So, the old model, which is a sort of Victorian capitalist model,

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,240
is you have the individual organism, and they happen to mutate, and that's it.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,040
And then there's the harsh environment of competition that kills them off or they survive.

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,960
And it's just that, that's the model.

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,160
So, the model is changing, and it's part of the revolution.

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,360
The science, where science is happening right now is not physics.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,720
Physics has been stalled for 40 years.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,200
The science, where science is happening is biology.

33
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,520
And it's niche construction is the idea, and the idea is this.

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,000
Organisms are not passive.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,440
They are active shapers of their environment, and then that shaped environment in term shapes them.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,920
They shape the environment, the environment shapes them, and it loops like this.

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,400
And you notice I do this a lot when I talk about Fourier-Cogsci.

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
It's that loop.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
It's niche construction.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,840
It's a mutual shaping so that they fit together in an important way.

41
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,280
There's a conformity between the organism and the environment.

42
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,720
They belong together.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,440
Now that belonging together is, I'm going to argue, well I'm arguing right now, is what

44
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,320
Kellyanne Allen, this is the second Allen.

45
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,240
First is John A. Second is Kellyanne.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,520
In her work, calls belonging, the sense of belonging.

47
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:08,440
And please remember the assonance between longing and belonging.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
What is belonging?

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,960
Belonging is a sense of, quote, deep connection with social groups, physical places, and collective

50
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,760
experiences.

51
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,720
That's from the paper in 2021.

52
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,480
And then there's the book in 2021 as well.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,920
I think that deep connection is in the sense of belonging that she's talking about is deeply

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,160
convergent with the work I do on relevance realization and religio and meaning in life

55
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,840
as a fundamental connectedness to yourself, to other people, and to the world.

56
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,800
And as often the case in psychology, we have these two literatures, meaning and life literature,

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,960
and the belonging literature talking about basically the same thing and not talking to

58
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,240
each other because psychology is in a mess right now.

59
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,000
And see the work of my good friend Greg Enriquez on how we can fix that problem.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,480
Right now I'll take it as a point of convergence.

61
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,000
In the early end, Alan goes on, it is, quote, a fundamental need that predicts.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,360
Notice the language here.

63
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,640
Psychologists are usually deeply cautious.

64
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,400
It seems to us after the evidence that perhaps it has suggested that.

65
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,720
That's how it usually is written.

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,200
But here it's, listen to the language.

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
It is a fundamental need.

68
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,160
This is like a summative paper that predicts numerous mental, physical, social, economic,

69
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,640
and behavioral outcomes.

70
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,960
In short, the evidence is overwhelming.

71
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,440
This is why when people say, I don't know what it means about the meaning crisis.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,960
In short, if you do not have a sense of belonging, you are in serious trouble.

73
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Mentally, physically, economically, behaviorally, socially.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
It's powerfully predictive of that.

75
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Next to knowing your IQ, I want to know if you have a sense of belonging.

76
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,160
I want to know if you have a sense of meaning in life.

77
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
And this is how you, there's two questions you can ask to get out to you have meaning

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,220
in life.

79
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,200
What do you want to exist even if you don't?

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:17,680
And how connected, how much of a difference do you make to it?

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
So there's actually two sides.

82
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,800
There's the result, which is belonging, and then there's the process, fitting in.

83
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,760
This is, and we've been using this language probably your whole life, fitting in.

84
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
I want to fit in.

85
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,760
I want to fit in.

86
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,760
I don't fit in.

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I do this.

88
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Right?

89
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay.

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,960
But listen to the language fitting in, like this deep, connected, belonging, conformity

91
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,960
participating in.

92
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,080
And I think this has a lot to do as I, I'll only do this a couple more times.

93
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
I think this has a lot to do with the recursive relevance realization.

94
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
Okay.

95
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,360
But how is that niche construction, organism shaping the environment, environment shaping

96
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
the organism.

97
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
They belong together.

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,760
There's a sense of belonging fit in.

99
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:18,600
I think that gets taken up into the cognitive and therefore on the cusp of the spiritual

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,320
with the work that myself and Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic covered in

101
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,880
the book, Zombies in Western Culture, 21st Century Crisis.

102
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,320
We talked about worldview attunement, which is this idea.

103
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,960
I think that that's basically our religio, niche construction.

104
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:48,880
You have a view of the world that supports your view of how you view, how you know, how

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
you connect.

106
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,800
And you have a theory of connection that helps to support and substantiate your view of the

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,160
world and they mutually support each other.

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,040
And we have that with the Aristotelian worldview.

109
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,680
And then we broke it and smashed it and we haven't had worldview attunement ever since.

110
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,240
And the, you know, a clear indicator of that is, and you've probably heard me make this

111
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,560
argument before, the pervasive worldview, the scientific worldview is a worldview in which

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,840
we do not belong, in which we do.

113
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,920
Our existence as cognitive, personal, moral agents doesn't belong.

114
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:39,480
So if we don't belong in the worldview, it's not doing worldview attunement for us.

115
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:47,480
So when we have worldview attunement, we get a network of affordances.

116
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:54,040
Just a reminder what an affordance is, affordance is a living possibility, a real possibility.

117
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,440
It's not created by the environment, it's not created by the organism, it's created

118
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,600
by how they mutually shape each other.

119
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,520
This affords me walking.

120
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,080
I and this have been mutually shaped by physics, by chemistry.

121
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,720
This and I have both been shaped by culture to fit each other.

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,640
So walking is available to me, there's an affordance.

123
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,200
There's all kinds of affordances now set out for me because of that co-shaping, fitting

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
together, belonging together.

125
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:35,920
Once you have this first stage, you're into an organism having a home range.

126
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,040
This is areas where the it is shaping the environment, the environment is shaping it.

127
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,600
A network of affordances is opening up, it's belonging, they're fitting together.

128
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,240
And space gets transformed into places connected by paths.

129
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,480
And you are looking out at the world and seeing places and paths and you're saying that's

130
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
just the way it is.

131
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,040
There are no places and paths in physics.

132
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,040
There's trajectories, there's locations.

133
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:19,560
In fact, this is so deep in us, in how we've been shaped, think, try to talk for a five

134
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,640
minutes without doing places and paths.

135
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,680
John has just started his lecture, soon he'll be halfway through his lecture, and then he'll

136
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,640
be at his end.

137
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,040
The marriage isn't going well, we seem to be floundering, we're off course.

138
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,840
Paths and places, look out around you, it's happening right now.

139
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,040
You're already starting to home this space.

140
00:10:51,040 --> 00:11:03,040
When you get that, when you get that home range, paths and places, the landscape courses,

141
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm using the word course and you're allowed to by the way, it's in the dictionary, I made

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
sure.

143
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,040
You can use course as a verb, the landscape courses, it flows, we talk about the hills

144
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,040
rolling, they're not rolling, if they were rolling we'd be absolutely terrified.

145
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:29,040
But I'm reading the great Gatsby long time ago in high school, galaxy far, far away.

146
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
And I'm reading this book, and why are they making me read this book?

147
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,040
It's this silly story, Daisy, Daisy, Nick, Grat Gatsby, and then I get, if you've read

148
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,040
the book, spoiler, you haven't.

149
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,040
And then you get to the last three pages and you go, oh my gosh, this whole book has been

150
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
about the American dream.

151
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:58,040
And you go, and there's that, and it first hit me, he's talking about it, and the author,

152
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:07,040
well Nick, Fitzgerald, pulls back from the tight closure of the story, and he talks about

153
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
the rolling hills of the Republic.

154
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,040
And I got this tremendous sense of, wait, there's a bigger thing going on here, there's this

155
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,040
whole landscape, there's this whole history, and it's paths and places and affordances,

156
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,040
and it's all alive, and he was trying to invoke that, and he was actually trying to symbolize

157
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,040
it in this rather trite love story.

158
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,040
It was one of those first great moments in my life when I realized how stupid I could be,

159
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,040
because I totally missed it, and it opened it up for me.

160
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,040
This is a home range, and what's really unique about human beings is their home range is quite

161
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,040
variable, and that's an advantage and a disadvantage.

162
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,040
See, the advantage for the gazelle, here's a gazelle, here's a baby gazelle, it fits right in,

163
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,040
and gazelles don't have existential, how can I be a good gazelle?

164
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm failing, they're right in.

165
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Your heritage gave you the capacity for home range like any other organism, but it's a movable home range,

166
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
because you know what culture is?

167
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Culture is niche construction on methamphetamines.

168
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
That's what culture is.

169
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Culture is, I'm going to go into this environment and I'm going to shape it and shape you so you belong there.

170
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:40,040
That's what culture is, and that's a great power, but it's also a great uprooting,

171
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,040
because there's no place you naturally belong,

172
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
and science fiction regularly reminds us about this.

173
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Organisms are doing this, and at some point our ancestors evolved so that they're becoming hunter-gatherers.

174
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,040
We're not clear about when, probably Homo erectus, probably around 800,000 years ago.

175
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I've held an 800,000-year-old Aschulean hand axe.

176
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
What is the next stage?

177
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,040
The next stage is the home base.

178
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,040
The home base is a fixed point within the home range in which everybody goes out from it,

179
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:36,040
they do stuff, and they come back to it, which seems right natural to you.

180
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,040
They go out and they come back, and then what they do is they share the butchering of the animals,

181
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,040
the preparation of food initially, but something that's really important happening here

182
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,040
when they come back, right?

183
00:14:52,040 --> 00:15:00,040
They're checking each other, because that system of distributed labor

184
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,040
requires you to all come back together, not only for the legitimate reasons,

185
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,040
we have to coordinate our labor, we have the synergy of coordinated communication,

186
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,040
but also in order to do cheater detection.

187
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,040
You shouldn't get the benefits if you haven't borne the costs,

188
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,040
and if you've borne the costs and not have the benefits, then something needs to change.

189
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,040
And if you don't think that's very neat, give your three-year-old,

190
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,040
this three-year-old and that three-year-old, give that one a bigger piece of chocolate cake.

191
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Human beings care so much about this that they will do the following.

192
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,040
If I sit you in a room and I give you $5 and you say,

193
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
you can keep the $5, great.

194
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
There's more to the science.

195
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Now what you do is you bring in two people and you say,

196
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,040
I'll give you $5, but only if you allow me to give him $10.

197
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
And then guess what they do?

198
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,040
No, I don't want it.

199
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:08,040
They're still getting $5 for free, but they don't want it because that has been broken down.

200
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,040
See, what we start to get into is a new normative space.

201
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:31,040
We're starting to think about the justice of our actions as opposed to just the efficacy of our actions.

202
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
So we've got distributed labor.

203
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:43,040
Now that requires something really, so far we've got this concern for justice, looking for cheating,

204
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,040
but looking for honoring because the opposite of catching a cheater is honoring somebody who's followed, played the rules.

205
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Distributed labor.

206
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:00,040
You're going out there, I'm going out there, and we can't talk to each other.

207
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Imagine if you had to run back every five minutes, and now we forget this.

208
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,040
See, I don't know how old John Van Dink is, I'm pretty old too.

209
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:23,040
So I grew up in this dark time in which your phone was in one place.

210
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:37,040
And you had to leave your phone behind, and you had to rely on other things to coordinate your behavior with other human beings.

211
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,040
It's funny, we still call it a phone, but if you actually call somebody on it, they freak out.

212
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Why are you calling me?

213
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,040
So think about what we had to rely on.

214
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,040
And here's a way of getting this a little bit closer.

215
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:01,040
So imagine a married couple that has been married for a long time because they love each other, not because they hate each other.

216
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Sometimes people stay together in marriage because they hate each other, because that's the greatest way to torture another human being.

217
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,040
That was my parents.

218
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:23,040
But I had the opposite, and my aunt and uncle and my aunt, this aunt, she was like a second mother to me.

219
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:33,040
They had been married, well, longer than I was alive, and when she came in the room, his eyes sparkled.

220
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,040
And there was like a telepathy between them.

221
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:47,040
He could just, eyes sparkle, and they almost didn't have to talk, and it's like, what's going on?

222
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Well, what's going on is, you have two human beings, and they're not always consulting each other.

223
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
They've internalized each other.

224
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
She has a model of him. He has a model of her.

225
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:10,040
So he can be over here, out of range of her, and coordinate his behavior with her by consulting the model.

226
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,040
But he has to let her live inside him.

227
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Some of you have said something sort of a little bit freaky to me, but I've tried to take it in good heart.

228
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,040
You say things to me like, John, you're in my head all day. That's a little bit weird for me.

229
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,040
But you see what you're doing? You're internalizing.

230
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Now, the thing is, you can't internalize forever.

231
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:36,040
So what you have to do is, you have to periodically all come together, the nexus point,

232
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:42,040
and make sure the models all match, that they haven't got out of sync.

233
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,040
So the ability to go out and do distributed labor, which is how we build this,

234
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:57,040
requires that we come together and have a common point, a common unity,

235
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,040
a community in which we correct how the models get out of sync with each other.

236
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,040
And that's what Paul, I think, and Jonathan are often talking about.

237
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Church can be a pretty shitty place.

238
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Because you have all these, oh, that's not how it is.

239
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,040
But what's really interesting is your brain actually works this way.

240
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,040
So your brain face is a problem. It's actually not one machine.

241
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,040
It's a machine of machines that can make itself into a new kind of machine,

242
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
which is unlike anything we have right now yet.

243
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,040
And these can, well, we all know, they can work at cross purposes.

244
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,040
They can be antagonistic to each other.

245
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,040
So the way we deal with that problem of things working at cross purposes

246
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,040
is we have them communicate. That improves efficiency.

247
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,040
So we can improve efficiency by having parts of the brain talk to each other all the time.

248
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,040
There's a problem with that. Two problems is when the brain is talking a lot to itself,

249
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,040
it's not paying much attention to the world.

250
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Secondly, when all that energy is being expended, it's very expensive.

251
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
This is what the brain does.

252
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,040
It actually does, has different areas of the brain.

253
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,040
They model each other. They mutually model each other.

254
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,040
And then the brain cycles.

255
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,040
It cycles between you're focused on the world, right,

256
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
and all the parts are relying on the model of each other to coordinate

257
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
without talking to each other very much, so all of that energy can be channeled.

258
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
And then it goes to another time when you're basically not focused on the world

259
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
and all the parts are talking to each other.

260
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Your attention is trying to do it right now.

261
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Because part of your attention is task focused.

262
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,040
What is he going to say next? He's so weird.

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,040
And then there's another part of you that is trying to mind-wander.

264
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,040
Mind-wandering is when you disconnect from the world

265
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,040
and the parts are basically talking to each other for what purpose?

266
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Mind-wandering.

267
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
It seems like the most useless thing and you spend so much time in mind-wandering

268
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,040
because this is when the models all connect and make sure they're tracking each other

269
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,040
and you cycle back and forth and your attention is trying to do it right now.

270
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,040
And then you get an advantage out of that.

271
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,040
The mind-wandering opens up variations of things and perspectives that are relevant to you

272
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,040
because you're always the hero of your mind-wandering.

273
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
You don't mind-wander.

274
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Hey, I'm going to mind-wander about Pete Seeger or somebody else.

275
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,040
You mind? It's always you.

276
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,040
It's you. How are things relevant to me?

277
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,040
In fact, what's happening is, you know, John Veracchis, it's not really relevant to me.

278
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Here's a bunch of stuff that's relevant to me.

279
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
That's mind-wandering.

280
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
And then what you do is you open up the possibilities of how things are relevant.

281
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
You open up variation on what you can pay attention to

282
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,040
and then you kill most of it off when you come back to focusing on me.

283
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,040
But some of it stays and you make connections that are relevant to you.

284
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
You evolve your attentional fit.

285
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Variation with the mind-wandering.

286
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Selection with the task focus.

287
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,040
And you do this and you're evolving your connectedness.

288
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:14,040
We figured out with home range and home base how to do that with collective intelligence.

289
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,040
We all go out with our mutual models and then we come back into common unity, the community,

290
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,040
and we do all this stuff that seems relatively useless so that we, right,

291
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,040
and the whole community evolves its grip on the world.

292
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:49,040
So this interaction between home range and home base starts to evolve

293
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,040
and develop intelligence, collective intelligence,

294
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,040
the intelligence of distributed cognition.

295
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,040
And then of course what happens is individual cognition and collective cognition

296
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:04,040
start to bootstrap each other.

297
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,040
If I internalize her and she internalizes me,

298
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,040
she can actually take my perspective on her perspective.

299
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
That's what she's doing when she's doing that coordinated.

300
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,040
But then she can just do that when she needs to.

301
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
Not just when she's coordinating with me.

302
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I can, what would John think?

303
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,040
What would Jonathan, what would Paul think?

304
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Oh, your metacognitive capacities expand dramatically.

305
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Your ability to be aware of how you're aware, to know how you're knowing,

306
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,040
to learn how to learn all goes up significantly.

307
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,040
This is all enmeshed with home range and home base.

308
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,040
But how is the home base chosen?

309
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Well, think about campfire.

310
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,040
How do you choose it?

311
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,040
So there's a theory, we've got to modify the theory because the empirical record

312
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
for the initial presentation of the theory has made up and modified.

313
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,040
The original theory is prospect and refuge.

314
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Prospect and refuge says you're always looking for places where you have

315
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,040
significant prospects so you can see a lot.

316
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,040
But there's refuge for you.

317
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Now, originally they thought that was, like, I want to be able to see a lot,

318
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
but I want to be able to hide a lot.

319
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
And that turns out to be wrong.

320
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Because it makes predictions.

321
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,040
You show people pictures of, like, here's all this expanse you can see,

322
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,040
but you're also sort of in a jungle and people don't want to be there.

323
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,040
Because here's the thing, if you could hide in it, so could someone else.

324
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
So could a predator.

325
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
So you don't want lots of hiding places.

326
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,040
So it's more like what I want in refuge is I want a place where I can defend myself

327
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,040
or escape, reliably escape.

328
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,040
So when I say refuge, I want you to hear that, okay?

329
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Now think about this, because I've been thinking about this

330
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,040
and what Paul was saying about rest and how it's not just lastitude.

331
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,040
And I was thinking, what went through my head was this phrase,

332
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,040
a refuge without prospect is a prison.

333
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,040
And prospect without refuge is wilderness.

334
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,040
You don't want either of those.

335
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,040
You don't want either of those.

336
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,040
So this might surprise you that I would make this move.

337
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,040
You're seeking for an optimal grip between that trade-off relationship.

338
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
And so you're trying to pick a place.

339
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,040
So you've got all this affordance network.

340
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,040
You want a place that gives you this sort of optimal grip between prospect and refuge.

341
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
It's a nexus point.

342
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,040
It gives you easy access to many different courses of action you can undertake.

343
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Now I want you to think about what a way of thinking about that.

344
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I'm going to use a martial arts analogy.

345
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
I think I used it in Thunder Bay, but I'm going to use it again.

346
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
It's a slightly different one, okay?

347
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,040
So the reason I'm using this is because I'm going to really play on optimal gripping.

348
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
There's things when you're doing and you're grappling with somebody

349
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,040
and you need to get literally the optimal grip on them to throw them.

350
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Like you don't want to lean too far forward because then they can,

351
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,040
you know, that's not going to, you got to do this thing.

352
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,040
So there's all these different things you're doing that are optimal grips on your opponent.

353
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
But you don't start out that way.

354
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
You start out, you take your stance.

355
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Now this doesn't do anything.

356
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,040
You don't use this for anything.

357
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
What's the point of a stance?

358
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,040
So think about all the optimal grippings I can have.

359
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,040
The stance puts me in an optimal place to get to any of those optimal gripping.

360
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Do you understand?

361
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,040
The stance allows me, oh, if I hear, I can quickly,

362
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,040
if I'm here, I can, right, I can quickly step back if I need to.

363
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
I can come over.

364
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,040
I can, right, there's all these things I can do from the stance.

365
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
You have a stance.

366
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,040
It's, it's your meta optimal grip.

367
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,040
And I have to have a few metas or you wouldn't believe it was me giving the talk, right?

368
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
It's your meta optimal grip point.

369
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:17,040
And it's at the point that gives you the best optimal relationship between prospect and refuge.

370
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
And then you have this point.

371
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,040
It's the point that is your entry into the affordance network.

372
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
It's giving you meta optimal grip.

373
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,040
It's an origin point for all of the journeys that you're going to take and you're going to come back to.

374
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:45,040
It allows you to navigate your home range and to share that with other people

375
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,040
because we can all mutually model the origin point so that we can easily coordinate our behavior.

376
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:01,040
So that you get the ability to undertake what's called orientation.

377
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,040
This is the work of Stegmeyer.

378
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040
2019 is an astonishing book on orientation, the philosophy of orientation.

379
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,040
And he talks about how orient the ability.

380
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
Okay.

381
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,040
So if you were to ask many people today how they're wrestling with things,

382
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,040
they will use metaphors or they will even use the word I feel disoriented.

383
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
I don't know which way is up or down.

384
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I don't know which way to go.

385
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
And it's all metaphorical.

386
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,040
They're talking about this fundamental ability of orientation.

387
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Right.

388
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
When we orient, I want to coin a word.

389
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
I don't know if it's a word.

390
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,040
I want to talk about co-orientation like the way we talk about coordination.

391
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:51,040
We have co-orientation when we have the home base.

392
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,040
And we take that up into our worldview and we can navigate the worldview.

393
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,040
We can co-orient in that worldview and move around in that space

394
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,040
so that we can coordinate our distributed cognition,

395
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,040
access that collective intelligence.

396
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,040
That's what orientation does for you, shared orientation.

397
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
We even do it.

398
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
We even do it temporally.

399
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
We've been talking about this.

400
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Right.

401
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
We have retrospective.

402
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
Right.

403
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
We have this retrospective.

404
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,040
We want, remember I didn't mean rest.

405
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Sorry, I didn't mean hiding.

406
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:48,040
The path should provide some kind of refuge for us now.

407
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,040
It should have, all of these things should have converged

408
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,040
so that we have a trustworthy home base

409
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,040
that then gives us prospect for the future.

410
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,040
We feel so that we can properly do this.

411
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,040
We can, there's a common unity

412
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,040
that gives us a common law of the precedent

413
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,040
that has been vouchsafed to us from the past.

414
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,040
And then it encourages us to be prospectively responsible

415
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,040
and try and set precedent for the people in the future.

416
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,040
And this of course is random's work on reason and philosophy,

417
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
his new interpretation of Hegel.

418
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,040
And that what we're trying to do is constantly find ourselves

419
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,040
in that stream, in that course of the common law

420
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
of distributed cognition.

421
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,040
We can draw from the past and we can prospect to the future

422
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
and then we are oriented.

423
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Then we are oriented.

424
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
So, we've got the home base

425
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
and it's within the home range

426
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,040
and then all of this is within the horizon.

427
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
But with the home base and the home range

428
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
we have this sort of resonance field

429
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:14,040
in which the land flows, we belong to it.

430
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,040
And then on top of it we have this ability to orient

431
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,040
and to co-orient and to form community

432
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,040
and access not only the community here now

433
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
but the community of the past and the community of the future.

434
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,040
And I take it that Christians represent that

435
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
with the community of the saints and things like that.

436
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Or at least some branch of Christians.

437
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I have to be honest, sometimes I can't keep all of you straight.

438
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
And I say that affectionately.

439
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
So what happens with this orientation

440
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
is remember with the first thing,

441
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
space became places linked by paths.

442
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Now the paths and the places are transformed into maps.

443
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Cognitive maps.

444
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,040
And a map is a powerful thing.

445
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
And then what Descartes did, by the way,

446
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
he figured out how to take our mapping ability

447
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,040
and our orienting ability and turn it into a graph

448
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
because that's all it is.

449
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
It's a mapping from an origin point.

450
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
That's why it's called the origin point, by the way,

451
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
on a Cartesian graph.

452
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,040
See, what a map does is it reduces your cognitive load.

453
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,040
You don't have to remember all the idiosyncratic paths and pathways.

454
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,040
You don't have to, by the way, in the dark times,

455
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
you didn't have Siri,

456
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:43,040
we would go to the glove box

457
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
and we would retrieve the parchment.

458
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,040
We called them maps and we would open the map.

459
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,040
And I had never trod this path or been in that place.

460
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
But I could find my way.

461
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
I didn't have to.

462
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
See, once you have a map,

463
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,040
you don't have to hold all the paths and places.

464
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Imagine if your environment was the way you treat your house.

465
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
You had to memorize it.

466
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,040
So your range gets limited when you don't have cognitive maps.

467
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,040
When you have cognitive maps,

468
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,040
you can go to all kinds of places you haven't been before

469
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
with confidence.

470
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I encourage you to interpolate, extrapolate,

471
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,040
to go into the unknown with a kind of confidence.

472
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,040
It charges that space.

473
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Sorry, that's not even right.

474
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,040
It charges that relationship between the home base,

475
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,040
the home range and the horizon.

476
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
It charges it.

477
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
It becomes a resonance field.

478
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
It's resonant with possibilities for you

479
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,040
because you won't be overwhelmed because you have the map.

480
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,040
So now you see the belonging and the co-orienting are actually,

481
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
they're not being left behind.

482
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,040
They're mutually nested within each other, growing each other.

483
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Now we move to the third, which is the hearth and hospital.

484
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Now I need you to hear something.

485
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
The word hospital.

486
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Hear it the way it originally was meant in the word hospitality.

487
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,040
So sometime after we started home basing,

488
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
our ancestors get fire.

489
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
And they start to reliably use it.

490
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,040
And there's a lot of dispute about how ancient that is,

491
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
but it's reliably we've got evidence for 500,000 years.

492
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Some older sites maybe we don't know.

493
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,040
And we don't know, like if we don't quite know

494
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,040
if the home basing is first and the fire comes along

495
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
or the fire and the home basing come together.

496
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
We don't know.

497
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
I'm just giving you, so I'm talking more about stages

498
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,040
than perhaps the actual historical sequence.

499
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,040
What happens around the hearth in the hospital?

500
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,040
Healing.

501
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,040
We start to really start to heal each other when we're sick,

502
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,040
when we're wounded.

503
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,040
And that again seems as the natural thing to do for you.

504
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:31,040
It's not, right, for most organisms, right?

505
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,040
Of course, we have now the nursery.

506
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
And think about how the nursery and the healing overlap.

507
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
We talk about nurses.

508
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
They're not raising children.

509
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
They're healing the sick.

510
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,040
We see a relationship between those.

511
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Now what's happening when you have the home base

512
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,040
and the hearth is you've got the extension of agopic love

513
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,040
from the mother and the child to the extended family.

514
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,040
That is a huge, huge advantage.

515
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:07,040
That's a huge advantage.

516
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,040
This is why for many people, people who don't have houses,

517
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,040
like the indigenous people in Australia,

518
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
they don't have houses.

519
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
They have kinship systems.

520
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,040
That's how they feel at home.

521
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,040
And they're really, like, it's hard to figure out.

522
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,040
It's so complex, even convoluted,

523
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,040
and sophisticated the way the kinship systems work

524
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,040
and the way you name people so that, like,

525
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
you're my mother-in-law.

526
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,040
What?

527
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Well, because, and it's just, like, it's bizarre.

528
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Like, I'm struggling to understand it from the outside,

529
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,040
but all I know is it's impressive.

530
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
There's, of course, food sharing,

531
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
and we still do that.

532
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,040
We just did it.

533
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Until we had phones in the dark time,

534
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
eating up, you'd go to a restaurant

535
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,040
and you ate by yourself.

536
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,040
It was awful.

537
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Or that's, so there's the looker,

538
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:10,040
or there's the ignorer.

539
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Now what we do is we pretend that we're important

540
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
and we're obviously involved with something new.

541
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
My phone.

542
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,040
The president's talking to me.

543
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Right?

544
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
And, of course, as I said, there's social bonding.

545
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,040
But think about what's also going on in the hearth.

546
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,040
There's the fire.

547
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
And what I said,

548
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
to really pick up on what Jonathan was saying,

549
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
think about what fire is.

550
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Fire shines and it withdraws at the same time.

551
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,040
You can follow it, but you can't grab it.

552
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
It's about, so you're in this place

553
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
where all these transformations are happening.

554
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
The kitchen is a transformation.

555
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,040
The food, the child rearing, the healing,

556
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
all this transformation.

557
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
And then you've got this incarnation of transformation,

558
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
elusively present there.

559
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,040
And Matt Rosano has talked about,

560
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
like, that being around campfires

561
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,040
probably affected, right,

562
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
in the niche construction manner,

563
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
the evolution of our intelligence.

564
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,040
Because fire is hypnotic.

565
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
It's amazing.

566
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Human beings...

567
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:26,040
You light a fire in there.

568
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
And part of the problem with the video world

569
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
is it generates the campfire effect,

570
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,040
but there's no campfire.

571
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Pause on that.

572
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,040
See, when I'm in a campfire,

573
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
your face is lit and only your face,

574
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,040
and I don't see the rest of you,

575
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
like a video screen,

576
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
which is lit and I don't see the rest of you.

577
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
You're very close.

578
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,040
You're closer than you normally are with somebody at a campfire.

579
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Same with the video screen.

580
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,040
But we don't have a common origin.

581
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
We don't have the fire.

582
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,040
We don't have the fire reminding us of the reality,

583
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
of how being shines forth,

584
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,040
but always also withdraws.

585
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
And no wonder that Heraclitus,

586
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,040
who brought the notion of the logos into philosophical

587
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,040
and then ultimately religious use,

588
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:21,040
chose the fire as the symbol of the logos.

589
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,040
And we talk about conversations that catch fire,

590
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,040
because fire has its ability to catch and organize and grow.

591
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
It shines and withdraws.

592
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
It appears and it disappears.

593
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
And this is reality.

594
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
And what we can do with the fire,

595
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
which is so chaotic,

596
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
is we can get into symbolic resonance with it.

597
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,040
It can make us aware of the transformation that's happening in us.

598
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
And then we can see more in the fire

599
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
than just its superficial presence.

600
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
We start to see more deeply into it,

601
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,040
and it starts to disclose something more deeply into us,

602
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
and we symbolically resonance,

603
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,040
and we start to get ontological depth perception happening.

604
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,040
And then we also start doing that with each other around the campfire.

605
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
I open myself up so you can see into me,

606
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
and you open yourself up so you can see into me.

607
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
And we do this, and we reciprocally open,

608
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
and we get ontological depth perception.

609
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,040
So what's happening is

610
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,040
we start to do things that the kids are already doing around the hearth.

611
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Symbolically resonant, serious play called ritual.

612
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,040
Imaginally augmented perception and conception.

613
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,040
The serious play designed not for any goal,

614
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,040
but for transformation itself.

615
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
And there's a process there.

616
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Rituals have a rationality to them.

617
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
It's not the rationality of propositions.

618
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,040
A ritual is rational, ratio, properly proportioned,

619
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,040
if it transfers broadly and deeply outside of the context

620
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,040
in which the ritual is practiced.

621
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
The point isn't in the ritual.

622
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,040
It is, but it isn't.

623
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
What I mean is, if the ritual just stays in the ritual,

624
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
Kierkegaard has this wonderful parable about this.

625
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
There's a bunch of geese, they walk into a church,

626
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,040
and they all sing about flying, and then they walk out.

627
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
And he said, that's a lot of Christianity today.

628
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:23,040
And he's a Christian.

629
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
Fire walking, fire.

630
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
Fire walking is a ritual around the world.

631
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Why? It seems so bizarre and strange.

632
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
What's going on?

633
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Well, here's what's going on.

634
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,040
When I'm walking on coals, they're actually slow conductors of heat.

635
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,040
So if I walk fast enough, I won't get burned.

636
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,040
But if I walk too fast, I'll kick up the coals and I'll get burned.

637
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
So I have to get my timing just right.

638
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,040
So I have all of this mindfulness about, I get right,

639
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
very mindful of a situation, so I get the timing just right.

640
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Now, do you think that ability transfers broadly and deeply in your life?

641
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,040
You better believe it.

642
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,040
So fire walking, the fire.

643
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,040
We get that in the hearth.

644
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
So what's happening here?

645
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,040
Well, at that origin point that's been horizontal, the map,

646
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,040
we now get the vertical intersecting.

647
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,040
We discover spaces below and spaces above and how to navigate those spaces

648
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
and return to the origin point.

649
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
And this is ancient.

650
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,040
We've got clear evidence of at least 15,000 years ago of shamans

651
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,040
and the three-tiered cosmos.

652
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:48,040
There's the underworld, this world, and the overworld.

653
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,040
There's the pathological depth perception, navigating it.

654
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,040
We're taking all of these other skills from the home range and the home base

655
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,040
and we're taking them up into the ritualization and the transformation

656
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,040
around the hearth and the hospital and we're getting the vertical dimension

657
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,040
and where the vertical dimension intersects the origin point,

658
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,040
you have the axis mundi.

659
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,040
And as Jonathan is frequently pointing out to you,

660
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:24,040
that's what the cross and the tree represent, if I understand him correctly.

661
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,040
And you nod when those symbols come out,

662
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,040
but try to be abstract for a moment and step outside of it.

663
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
It's like me coming up to you and saying,

664
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,040
it's all about the squirrel and the wash basin.

665
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,040
What?

666
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,040
But if I say, it's all about this axis mundi,

667
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,040
this tree that grows to the depths and to the heights.

668
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:58,040
And of course, trees are also the source of wood which provides fire.

669
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:06,040
Okay.

670
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:16,040
So, all of this is being lost.

671
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,040
You might have heard me talk about this.

672
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,040
We're all experiencing domicile.

673
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,040
So, Kellyanne Allen who does work on belonging.

674
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Belonging is declining massively and quickly with horrible consequences.

675
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Undeniable empirical evidence.

676
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,040
One sure measure, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?

677
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,040
No matter how connected we are, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?

678
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,040
How much of your days are lonely, reliably going up?

679
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,040
Just one measure.

680
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,040
There's many other measures just to give you a clear example of that.

681
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,040
You know, and this is like, I've said this before,

682
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
this is like something out of Orwell.

683
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,040
The United Kingdom has set up a ministry of loneliness

684
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,040
because they figured out that if they don't fix this problem,

685
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:16,040
they're in a lot of trouble.

686
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Of course, I don't think the United States will do such a thing

687
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,040
and Canada isn't doing anything right now.

688
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:32,040
So, all that religio, meaning in life, belongingness,

689
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,040
worldview, attunement, that's all going away.

690
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,040
The loss of our awareness and appreciation of the non-propositional,

691
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,040
knowing so that we can rightly and deeply participate in ritual.

692
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Notice how the word ritual, post-Freud,

693
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,040
has become the way of talking about an obsessive pathology.

694
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,040
That's how far we've come.

695
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
And of course, as Brian Wallace said,

696
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,040
home is where we take the symbols that are in our,

697
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,040
like right there, pregnant, like the path that's right there.

698
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,040
And that's how I think, it's how I think about intentionality.

699
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,040
We take the symbols right there, ready to be birthed,

700
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,040
and then we have to set it into a ritual community,

701
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,040
and that is what we do to make a home.

702
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,040
A home is a machine in which symbol and ritual come together.

703
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,040
And if you don't think that's what a home is,

704
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,040
skip Christmas next time and see how everybody reacts around it.

705
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
No, we're just not going to do Christmas this year.

706
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,040
We're not going to decorate, we're not going to do this.

707
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,040
People will hate you in a way you've never been hated before.

708
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:03,040
We've lost co-orientation, origin point, the vertical.

709
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
We've been reduced to the horizontal.

710
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
We've lost the Axis Mundi.

711
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,040
But as I've tried to show,

712
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,040
all of those things are part of who and what we are.

713
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:18,040
So as they have come into question, we have come into question.

714
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,040
We are in question in a way, and Heidegger is the prophet of this.

715
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,040
He says we are the beings whose being is in question.

716
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,040
And the fact that we lack an ability to wonder in that fashion

717
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,040
is precisely what he says is one of the origins of nihilism for us.

718
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,040
So when we wonder, we call ourselves in the world into question.

719
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
But we also wander.

720
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
Wandering is when we're disoriented and we don't know where to go.

721
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:56,040
So we're wondering and wandering as we're in question,

722
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,040
as we're seeking orientation, as we're trying to find the origin

723
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,040
that will put us into right relationship to the horizon.

724
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
And that is exactly what a quest is.

725
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,040
The word quest and question are related for a deep reason.

726
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,040
In a quest, you are what's in question.

727
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,040
You're wondering as you're wandering.

728
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,040
There is no answer to the question without the transformation

729
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,040
that is brought about by undergoing the quest.

730
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,040
We need a reciprocal reconstruction of our worldview.

731
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:34,040
We need to bring back the reinventio of co-orientation.

732
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,040
We need the reinventio of symbolic resonance and ritual.

733
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:41,040
We need to do this in a coordinated fashion.

734
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,040
We started not on time. How much time do I have left?

735
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Pardon me?

736
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
Nine minutes.

737
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,040
That's perfect. Nine's good. I'm happy.

738
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
Okay.

739
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:09,040
So, part of what has to do,

740
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,040
and I really had this in my notes before Jonathan gave his talk,

741
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:21,040
part of it has to do with a relationship.

742
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,040
We have to get back to this fundamental orientation point

743
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,040
in our meta-optimal gripping.

744
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,040
We have to get all the way back there because that's how deep the problem is.

745
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,040
Attempting to solve the problem anywhere that's more shallow than that

746
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,040
won't give us the transformation of the ontological depth perception that we need.

747
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:49,040
We have to get back to that orientation, which we're so badly lacking.

748
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,040
The problem is, when you lack orientation, you don't know which way to go to get it.

749
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,040
So, you can see the 20th...

750
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,040
Well, you can see actually all of the centuries since the Enlightenment

751
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,040
is us thrashing around, trying to...

752
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,040
First of all, what we'll do is we'll get an absolute foundation in science and math,

753
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,040
and that will be our origin and that fell apart.

754
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,040
What we'll do is we'll actually...

755
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,040
We'll take into our hands technology and we'll build the...

756
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,040
Oh, no.

757
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,040
In fact, right?

758
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,040
And I don't want to talk about this too much, right?

759
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,040
Well, if you want to talk about it, I'll talk about it.

760
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
I don't want to talk about it right now.

761
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,040
But the advent of AGI, which is now on the horizon,

762
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,040
and if you hear one thing I say to you,

763
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,040
it's don't pretend that's not the case.

764
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
Don't pretend that's not the case.

765
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,040
We need the very best from all of us right now

766
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,040
and pretending it's not the case is not helping.

767
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,040
It is harming.

768
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,040
So, what do we need to do?

769
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,040
We have to get to this ability where we can reorient

770
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,040
because the advent of AI has said to us,

771
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,040
the promise of the Enlightenment, not the promise of Enlightenment,

772
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
that's a different thing.

773
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
The promise of the Enlightenment.

774
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,040
The Promethean promise.

775
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,040
We have discovered that history is not about God or being

776
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,040
or the true or the good or the beautiful.

777
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
History is about us.

778
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
We are the authors of history.

779
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
We are the telos.

780
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
We are the point of history.

781
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,040
The point of history is to bring us to completion

782
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,040
as free agents in the world.

783
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,040
What's freedom?

784
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,040
Don't ask that.

785
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,040
Freedom, freedom.

786
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,040
And there's a lot of good...

787
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,040
I don't want to live in a world before the Enlightenment.

788
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,040
But we paid this price because we started down a course of action

789
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,040
that has got us to the...

790
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,040
I work with Jeffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.

791
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,040
He is the Godfather of artificial intelligence.

792
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:21,040
He quit his job so that he could speak freely

793
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,040
about the serious danger we're in right now.

794
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,040
The Enlightenment promised all of this,

795
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,040
and then we get to this place where we told,

796
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
oh, by the way, you weren't what this was all about,

797
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,040
and you are no longer the authors of history.

798
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,040
And you actually aren't going to matter very soon.

799
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,040
We tried that, and then we tried the vacillation

800
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,040
between various utopias and nostalgias,

801
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,040
and we fight bloody, titanic wars over it,

802
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,040
and it's all for bloody nothing.

803
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Jonathan spoke of a sacrifice.

804
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,040
We need to make a profound sacrifice

805
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,040
to get back to the point where reorientation is possible,

806
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,040
so that co-orientation is possible,

807
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,040
so that real community is possible.

808
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,040
We have to get to a kind...

809
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
See, I want to talk about something,

810
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,040
but I don't want you to hear a particular state.

811
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
I want you to hear the possibility

812
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,040
for the transformation of character that's in this.

813
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:40,040
So this goes to some of my scientific work.

814
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,040
I was at a monastery, Buddhist monastery,

815
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,040
just to keep things even,

816
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,040
I'm going to a Christian monastery after I'm here.

817
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,040
All balanced, and it's an Eastern Orthodox one,

818
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,040
so there you go, Jonathan.

819
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,040
But I was in a Buddhist monastery,

820
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,040
and I was talking about all the relevance realizations,

821
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,040
and I got talking to them,

822
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,040
and there was this sort of creative tension,

823
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,040
and I had a bunch of insights,

824
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,040
and it was in dialogue with other people,

825
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,040
something that had always been sort of like,

826
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,040
what is the proper stance,

827
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,040
stance, orientation,

828
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,040
towards being and the ground of being?

829
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,040
We don't ask that question, we presuppose we have answers,

830
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,040
but we don't have answers anymore,

831
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,040
and we got to get back to that.

832
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,040
What is the proper stance?

833
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,040
What are all these places that people are getting to

834
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,040
in their mind and spirit?

835
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,040
I don't care which entity you posit at being in right now.

836
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
And then I realized something,

837
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,040
and it helped me make sense of what I was reading

838
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,040
in the Tate Chen,

839
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,040
what I'm reading in Dojin,

840
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,040
and actually also what I'm reading in Maximus.

841
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
I hope that doesn't offend anybody,

842
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,040
because I mean it with affection.

843
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:06,040
Relevance realization is about our optimal gripping on things.

844
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,040
We even have a meta-optimal grip.

845
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,040
We have to get past that.

846
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,040
We have to start, that's what Jonathan was arguing.

847
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,040
We have to stop grasping.

848
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,040
Paul was doing it too about the restless resting.

849
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,040
Relevance realization can come to the realization

850
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,040
that it itself is irrelevant.

851
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,040
That what is not needed anymore

852
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,040
is what relevance realization does,

853
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,040
which is optimally gripped.

854
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,040
Because relevance realization is how I get into relationship

855
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,040
to this being, to this being, to this being, to this being,

856
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,040
to all of these beings.

857
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,040
But when I want to be in relationship to the ground of being,

858
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,040
I have to give up relevance realization.

859
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,040
I have to get to a state where I give up

860
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,040
that most fundamental human need to grasp.

861
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,040
And it's hard for us to think of it.

862
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,040
This metaphor is the comprandra.

863
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,040
This is the metaphor for getting it, for understanding.

864
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,040
But I won't understand, I can't write.

865
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,040
But then you get what you really want.

866
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,040
You get the place where you have the stance.

867
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:34,040
Towards being, towards the grounded being,

868
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:38,040
towards the no-thingness behind and within.

869
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,040
Maximus has this great thing, right?

870
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,040
I really love it, where he says,

871
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,040
God is inside of everything but not enclosed.

872
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,040
God is beyond everything but not excluded.

873
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,040
You can't get that with a graspy mind.

874
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:57,040
You can't get that with a graspy mind.

875
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,040
It's inside.

876
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,040
I don't have it, it's outside.

877
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,040
I'm sorry, this is exciting to me.

878
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
You're all just sort of here.

879
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:14,040
But look, this is like, when I did Lexio on it,

880
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,040
it's like, God is inside everything but not enclosed,

881
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,040
not imprisoned.

882
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,040
God is beyond everything but not excluded.

883
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:28,040
And I kept going, how do I get there with a grasping mind?

884
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,040
You can't.

885
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,040
You can't.

886
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:37,040
When you grieve up all your grasping,

887
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,040
you give up the nexus center point of all the grasping.

888
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,040
You get opened up.

889
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,040
I think it's a kind of deep depth,

890
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,040
like Jonathan was talking about,

891
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,040
with the possibility of a resurrection.

892
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,040
If we have the stance to the ground of being,

893
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,040
such that we can really live with,

894
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:03,040
be along with how it shines in and withdraws,

895
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,040
then we have the possibility of a fundamental reorientation

896
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,040
and a new existential stance in the world,

897
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
which is badly needed right now.

898
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Because all of the Cartesian things that we've gloried in,

899
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,040
well, look at how much I can calculate

900
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
and how I can paint and I can write poetry.

901
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,040
That is all going to be challenged very soon.

902
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:35,040
But this, this ability to enter into that axis-Mundi stance

903
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,040
towards the ground of being that liberates me

904
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,040
from the grasping so that I am in this deep,

905
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,040
right, Ratio, Ratio religio,

906
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:53,040
that is always available to you no matter what.

907
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,040
You long for home because we are woven with

908
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,040
the nesting of the home range,

909
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,040
the home base, and the hearth,

910
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,040
with the fire logos at the center,

911
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,040
the hearth and hospital.

912
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,040
We long for that.

913
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,040
We long for it.

914
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,040
But we're in a place where we need to recognize

915
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,040
what we are actually seeking.

916
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:32,040
We're seeking to belong, to orient, and to transcend.

917
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,040
And the right relationship with the ground of being

918
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:41,040
will give you those functions in a way that doesn't bind you

919
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,040
into that perpetual vacillation

920
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,040
between trying to find it retrospectively in the past,

921
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,040
trying to find it prospectively in the future,

922
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,040
but finding the common law, the through line,

923
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,040
that binds them all together.

924
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,040
Thank you very much for your time and attention.

925
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,040
Thank you, John.

926
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,040
We're actually going to move quickly into our discussion.

927
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,040
We have half an hour left before dinner.

928
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,040
So just take two minutes, get a drink,

929
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,040
use the washroom, and we'll get up, sit up.
