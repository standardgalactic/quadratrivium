WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
We're going to have John Vervakey speak to us now.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.800
He is the founder of the Vervakey Foundation and the Director

00:07.800 --> 00:10.920
of Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.080
He's the creator of the acclaimed Awakening

00:13.080 --> 00:17.040
from the Meeting Crisis and After Socrates series.

00:17.040 --> 00:33.120
Thank you. So, I have a choice here. I can give my talk or answer all of John's questions.

00:33.120 --> 00:49.480
All right. So, I'm changing this title slightly from in the program,

00:49.480 --> 00:54.200
the Cognitive Science of Home Belonging to the Home Range Orienting from the Homebase

00:54.200 --> 01:01.400
and Growing Up Around the Hearth Hospital. I chose the last one solely because it had

01:01.400 --> 01:06.720
H's in it. No, it actually captured better what I wanted to talk about.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.080
So, what I want to do is I want to make use of John A. Allens.

01:11.080 --> 01:15.280
There's going to be two Allens mentioned, so I'll try to keep them clear, separate for you.

01:15.280 --> 01:19.720
John A. Allens' book, Home, How Habitat Made Us Human.

01:19.720 --> 01:25.640
And I want to trace out the evolution of home in three stages towards answering the question,

01:25.720 --> 01:31.120
why do we long for home?

01:35.120 --> 01:39.720
Those three stages is not a ladder, but a nesting, and of course, nesting is a kind of home.

01:39.720 --> 01:45.760
But the three stages are the home range, the home base, and the hearth hospital.

01:45.760 --> 01:54.120
And I'm going to show how each is a stage in the shaping of cognition within 4e Cognitive Science.

01:54.120 --> 02:00.200
And then I want to talk about how that cognition is, I hope, plausibly exacted up into our spirituality

02:00.200 --> 02:06.160
and then talk about domicile and quest in that context.

02:06.160 --> 02:16.680
So, even before we were recognizably human, we were biological, our ancestors were biological organisms,

02:16.680 --> 02:21.440
and there's been a revolution in biology around this that gives us an important aspect

02:21.480 --> 02:24.400
of the first stage of the evolution of home.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.280
This is called niche construction.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.600
So, the old model, which is a sort of Victorian capitalist model,

02:30.600 --> 02:35.240
is you have the individual organism, and they happen to mutate, and that's it.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.040
And then there's the harsh environment of competition that kills them off or they survive.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.960
And it's just that, that's the model.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.160
So, the model is changing, and it's part of the revolution.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.360
The science, where science is happening right now is not physics.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.720
Physics has been stalled for 40 years.

02:51.720 --> 02:56.200
The science, where science is happening is biology.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.520
And it's niche construction is the idea, and the idea is this.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.000
Organisms are not passive.

03:03.000 --> 03:10.440
They are active shapers of their environment, and then that shaped environment in term shapes them.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.920
They shape the environment, the environment shapes them, and it loops like this.

03:14.920 --> 03:18.400
And you notice I do this a lot when I talk about Fourier-Cogsci.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.840
It's that loop.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.000
It's niche construction.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.840
It's a mutual shaping so that they fit together in an important way.

03:28.840 --> 03:35.280
There's a conformity between the organism and the environment.

03:35.280 --> 03:40.720
They belong together.

03:40.720 --> 03:48.440
Now that belonging together is, I'm going to argue, well I'm arguing right now, is what

03:48.440 --> 03:51.320
Kellyanne Allen, this is the second Allen.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.240
First is John A. Second is Kellyanne.

03:54.240 --> 04:01.520
In her work, calls belonging, the sense of belonging.

04:01.520 --> 04:08.440
And please remember the assonance between longing and belonging.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
What is belonging?

04:09.440 --> 04:15.960
Belonging is a sense of, quote, deep connection with social groups, physical places, and collective

04:15.960 --> 04:17.760
experiences.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.720
That's from the paper in 2021.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.480
And then there's the book in 2021 as well.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.920
I think that deep connection is in the sense of belonging that she's talking about is deeply

04:29.920 --> 04:36.160
convergent with the work I do on relevance realization and religio and meaning in life

04:36.160 --> 04:42.840
as a fundamental connectedness to yourself, to other people, and to the world.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.800
And as often the case in psychology, we have these two literatures, meaning and life literature,

04:47.800 --> 04:50.960
and the belonging literature talking about basically the same thing and not talking to

04:50.960 --> 04:54.240
each other because psychology is in a mess right now.

04:54.240 --> 05:00.000
And see the work of my good friend Greg Enriquez on how we can fix that problem.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.480
Right now I'll take it as a point of convergence.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.000
In the early end, Alan goes on, it is, quote, a fundamental need that predicts.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.360
Notice the language here.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.640
Psychologists are usually deeply cautious.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.400
It seems to us after the evidence that perhaps it has suggested that.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.720
That's how it usually is written.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.200
But here it's, listen to the language.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.600
It is a fundamental need.

05:24.600 --> 05:30.160
This is like a summative paper that predicts numerous mental, physical, social, economic,

05:30.160 --> 05:32.640
and behavioral outcomes.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.960
In short, the evidence is overwhelming.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.440
This is why when people say, I don't know what it means about the meaning crisis.

05:39.440 --> 05:45.960
In short, if you do not have a sense of belonging, you are in serious trouble.

05:45.960 --> 05:52.960
Mentally, physically, economically, behaviorally, socially.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.960
It's powerfully predictive of that.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.920
Next to knowing your IQ, I want to know if you have a sense of belonging.

05:57.920 --> 06:02.160
I want to know if you have a sense of meaning in life.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.520
And this is how you, there's two questions you can ask to get out to you have meaning

06:05.520 --> 06:07.220
in life.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.200
What do you want to exist even if you don't?

06:10.200 --> 06:17.680
And how connected, how much of a difference do you make to it?

06:17.680 --> 06:20.240
So there's actually two sides.

06:20.240 --> 06:25.800
There's the result, which is belonging, and then there's the process, fitting in.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.760
This is, and we've been using this language probably your whole life, fitting in.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.760
I want to fit in.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.760
I want to fit in.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.760
I don't fit in.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.360
I do this.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.360
Right?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
Okay.

06:35.360 --> 06:43.960
But listen to the language fitting in, like this deep, connected, belonging, conformity

06:43.960 --> 06:47.960
participating in.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.080
And I think this has a lot to do as I, I'll only do this a couple more times.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.360
I think this has a lot to do with the recursive relevance realization.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.360
Okay.

06:57.360 --> 07:05.360
But how is that niche construction, organism shaping the environment, environment shaping

07:05.360 --> 07:06.360
the organism.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.360
They belong together.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.760
There's a sense of belonging fit in.

07:09.760 --> 07:18.600
I think that gets taken up into the cognitive and therefore on the cusp of the spiritual

07:18.600 --> 07:24.320
with the work that myself and Christopher Massupietro and Philip Misovic covered in

07:24.320 --> 07:28.880
the book, Zombies in Western Culture, 21st Century Crisis.

07:28.880 --> 07:34.320
We talked about worldview attunement, which is this idea.

07:34.320 --> 07:39.960
I think that that's basically our religio, niche construction.

07:39.960 --> 07:48.880
You have a view of the world that supports your view of how you view, how you know, how

07:48.880 --> 07:49.880
you connect.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.800
And you have a theory of connection that helps to support and substantiate your view of the

07:53.800 --> 07:56.160
world and they mutually support each other.

07:56.160 --> 07:59.040
And we have that with the Aristotelian worldview.

07:59.040 --> 08:05.680
And then we broke it and smashed it and we haven't had worldview attunement ever since.

08:05.680 --> 08:12.240
And the, you know, a clear indicator of that is, and you've probably heard me make this

08:12.240 --> 08:17.560
argument before, the pervasive worldview, the scientific worldview is a worldview in which

08:17.560 --> 08:20.840
we do not belong, in which we do.

08:20.840 --> 08:28.920
Our existence as cognitive, personal, moral agents doesn't belong.

08:28.920 --> 08:39.480
So if we don't belong in the worldview, it's not doing worldview attunement for us.

08:39.480 --> 08:47.480
So when we have worldview attunement, we get a network of affordances.

08:47.480 --> 08:54.040
Just a reminder what an affordance is, affordance is a living possibility, a real possibility.

08:54.040 --> 08:58.440
It's not created by the environment, it's not created by the organism, it's created

08:58.440 --> 09:01.600
by how they mutually shape each other.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.520
This affords me walking.

09:03.520 --> 09:09.080
I and this have been mutually shaped by physics, by chemistry.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.720
This and I have both been shaped by culture to fit each other.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.640
So walking is available to me, there's an affordance.

09:15.640 --> 09:22.200
There's all kinds of affordances now set out for me because of that co-shaping, fitting

09:22.200 --> 09:26.200
together, belonging together.

09:26.200 --> 09:35.920
Once you have this first stage, you're into an organism having a home range.

09:35.920 --> 09:41.040
This is areas where the it is shaping the environment, the environment is shaping it.

09:41.040 --> 09:46.600
A network of affordances is opening up, it's belonging, they're fitting together.

09:46.600 --> 09:54.240
And space gets transformed into places connected by paths.

09:54.240 --> 09:59.480
And you are looking out at the world and seeing places and paths and you're saying that's

09:59.480 --> 10:00.480
just the way it is.

10:00.480 --> 10:05.040
There are no places and paths in physics.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.040
There's trajectories, there's locations.

10:09.040 --> 10:19.560
In fact, this is so deep in us, in how we've been shaped, think, try to talk for a five

10:19.560 --> 10:22.640
minutes without doing places and paths.

10:22.640 --> 10:28.680
John has just started his lecture, soon he'll be halfway through his lecture, and then he'll

10:28.680 --> 10:30.640
be at his end.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.040
The marriage isn't going well, we seem to be floundering, we're off course.

10:37.040 --> 10:42.840
Paths and places, look out around you, it's happening right now.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.040
You're already starting to home this space.

10:51.040 --> 11:03.040
When you get that, when you get that home range, paths and places, the landscape courses,

11:03.040 --> 11:06.040
I'm using the word course and you're allowed to by the way, it's in the dictionary, I made

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
sure.

11:07.040 --> 11:13.040
You can use course as a verb, the landscape courses, it flows, we talk about the hills

11:13.040 --> 11:19.040
rolling, they're not rolling, if they were rolling we'd be absolutely terrified.

11:19.040 --> 11:29.040
But I'm reading the great Gatsby long time ago in high school, galaxy far, far away.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
And I'm reading this book, and why are they making me read this book?

11:33.040 --> 11:39.040
It's this silly story, Daisy, Daisy, Nick, Grat Gatsby, and then I get, if you've read

11:39.040 --> 11:42.040
the book, spoiler, you haven't.

11:42.040 --> 11:48.040
And then you get to the last three pages and you go, oh my gosh, this whole book has been

11:48.040 --> 11:50.040
about the American dream.

11:50.040 --> 11:58.040
And you go, and there's that, and it first hit me, he's talking about it, and the author,

11:58.040 --> 12:07.040
well Nick, Fitzgerald, pulls back from the tight closure of the story, and he talks about

12:07.040 --> 12:10.040
the rolling hills of the Republic.

12:10.040 --> 12:17.040
And I got this tremendous sense of, wait, there's a bigger thing going on here, there's this

12:17.040 --> 12:22.040
whole landscape, there's this whole history, and it's paths and places and affordances,

12:22.040 --> 12:26.040
and it's all alive, and he was trying to invoke that, and he was actually trying to symbolize

12:26.040 --> 12:30.040
it in this rather trite love story.

12:30.040 --> 12:35.040
It was one of those first great moments in my life when I realized how stupid I could be,

12:35.040 --> 12:39.040
because I totally missed it, and it opened it up for me.

12:42.040 --> 12:50.040
This is a home range, and what's really unique about human beings is their home range is quite

12:50.040 --> 12:53.040
variable, and that's an advantage and a disadvantage.

12:53.040 --> 12:58.040
See, the advantage for the gazelle, here's a gazelle, here's a baby gazelle, it fits right in,

12:58.040 --> 13:04.040
and gazelles don't have existential, how can I be a good gazelle?

13:04.040 --> 13:08.040
I'm failing, they're right in.

13:08.040 --> 13:15.040
Your heritage gave you the capacity for home range like any other organism, but it's a movable home range,

13:15.040 --> 13:17.040
because you know what culture is?

13:17.040 --> 13:21.040
Culture is niche construction on methamphetamines.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
That's what culture is.

13:23.040 --> 13:30.040
Culture is, I'm going to go into this environment and I'm going to shape it and shape you so you belong there.

13:30.040 --> 13:40.040
That's what culture is, and that's a great power, but it's also a great uprooting,

13:40.040 --> 13:46.040
because there's no place you naturally belong,

13:46.040 --> 13:49.040
and science fiction regularly reminds us about this.

13:51.040 --> 13:59.040
Organisms are doing this, and at some point our ancestors evolved so that they're becoming hunter-gatherers.

13:59.040 --> 14:06.040
We're not clear about when, probably Homo erectus, probably around 800,000 years ago.

14:06.040 --> 14:11.040
I've held an 800,000-year-old Aschulean hand axe.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.040
What is the next stage?

14:18.040 --> 14:21.040
The next stage is the home base.

14:21.040 --> 14:28.040
The home base is a fixed point within the home range in which everybody goes out from it,

14:28.040 --> 14:36.040
they do stuff, and they come back to it, which seems right natural to you.

14:36.040 --> 14:42.040
They go out and they come back, and then what they do is they share the butchering of the animals,

14:42.040 --> 14:48.040
the preparation of food initially, but something that's really important happening here

14:48.040 --> 14:52.040
when they come back, right?

14:52.040 --> 15:00.040
They're checking each other, because that system of distributed labor

15:00.040 --> 15:05.040
requires you to all come back together, not only for the legitimate reasons,

15:05.040 --> 15:10.040
we have to coordinate our labor, we have the synergy of coordinated communication,

15:10.040 --> 15:17.040
but also in order to do cheater detection.

15:17.040 --> 15:21.040
You shouldn't get the benefits if you haven't borne the costs,

15:21.040 --> 15:26.040
and if you've borne the costs and not have the benefits, then something needs to change.

15:26.040 --> 15:31.040
And if you don't think that's very neat, give your three-year-old,

15:31.040 --> 15:36.040
this three-year-old and that three-year-old, give that one a bigger piece of chocolate cake.

15:36.040 --> 15:40.040
Human beings care so much about this that they will do the following.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.040
If I sit you in a room and I give you $5 and you say,

15:43.040 --> 15:47.040
you can keep the $5, great.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
There's more to the science.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
Now what you do is you bring in two people and you say,

15:51.040 --> 15:57.040
I'll give you $5, but only if you allow me to give him $10.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.040
And then guess what they do?

15:59.040 --> 16:02.040
No, I don't want it.

16:02.040 --> 16:08.040
They're still getting $5 for free, but they don't want it because that has been broken down.

16:08.040 --> 16:15.040
See, what we start to get into is a new normative space.

16:15.040 --> 16:31.040
We're starting to think about the justice of our actions as opposed to just the efficacy of our actions.

16:31.040 --> 16:35.040
So we've got distributed labor.

16:35.040 --> 16:43.040
Now that requires something really, so far we've got this concern for justice, looking for cheating,

16:43.040 --> 16:50.040
but looking for honoring because the opposite of catching a cheater is honoring somebody who's followed, played the rules.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.040
Distributed labor.

16:53.040 --> 17:00.040
You're going out there, I'm going out there, and we can't talk to each other.

17:01.040 --> 17:09.040
Imagine if you had to run back every five minutes, and now we forget this.

17:09.040 --> 17:14.040
See, I don't know how old John Van Dink is, I'm pretty old too.

17:14.040 --> 17:23.040
So I grew up in this dark time in which your phone was in one place.

17:23.040 --> 17:37.040
And you had to leave your phone behind, and you had to rely on other things to coordinate your behavior with other human beings.

17:37.040 --> 17:42.040
It's funny, we still call it a phone, but if you actually call somebody on it, they freak out.

17:42.040 --> 17:45.040
Why are you calling me?

17:45.040 --> 17:49.040
So think about what we had to rely on.

17:49.040 --> 17:54.040
And here's a way of getting this a little bit closer.

17:54.040 --> 18:01.040
So imagine a married couple that has been married for a long time because they love each other, not because they hate each other.

18:01.040 --> 18:07.040
Sometimes people stay together in marriage because they hate each other, because that's the greatest way to torture another human being.

18:07.040 --> 18:11.040
That was my parents.

18:12.040 --> 18:23.040
But I had the opposite, and my aunt and uncle and my aunt, this aunt, she was like a second mother to me.

18:23.040 --> 18:33.040
They had been married, well, longer than I was alive, and when she came in the room, his eyes sparkled.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.040
And there was like a telepathy between them.

18:37.040 --> 18:47.040
He could just, eyes sparkle, and they almost didn't have to talk, and it's like, what's going on?

18:47.040 --> 18:57.040
Well, what's going on is, you have two human beings, and they're not always consulting each other.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.040
They've internalized each other.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.040
She has a model of him. He has a model of her.

19:02.040 --> 19:10.040
So he can be over here, out of range of her, and coordinate his behavior with her by consulting the model.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.040
But he has to let her live inside him.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.040
Some of you have said something sort of a little bit freaky to me, but I've tried to take it in good heart.

19:18.040 --> 19:23.040
You say things to me like, John, you're in my head all day. That's a little bit weird for me.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.040
But you see what you're doing? You're internalizing.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.040
Now, the thing is, you can't internalize forever.

19:30.040 --> 19:36.040
So what you have to do is, you have to periodically all come together, the nexus point,

19:36.040 --> 19:42.040
and make sure the models all match, that they haven't got out of sync.

19:42.040 --> 19:48.040
So the ability to go out and do distributed labor, which is how we build this,

19:48.040 --> 19:57.040
requires that we come together and have a common point, a common unity,

19:57.040 --> 20:02.040
a community in which we correct how the models get out of sync with each other.

20:02.040 --> 20:05.040
And that's what Paul, I think, and Jonathan are often talking about.

20:05.040 --> 20:09.040
Church can be a pretty shitty place.

20:09.040 --> 20:13.040
Because you have all these, oh, that's not how it is.

20:13.040 --> 20:19.040
But what's really interesting is your brain actually works this way.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.040
So your brain face is a problem. It's actually not one machine.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.040
It's a machine of machines that can make itself into a new kind of machine,

20:26.040 --> 20:31.040
which is unlike anything we have right now yet.

20:31.040 --> 20:36.040
And these can, well, we all know, they can work at cross purposes.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.040
They can be antagonistic to each other.

20:39.040 --> 20:44.040
So the way we deal with that problem of things working at cross purposes

20:44.040 --> 20:48.040
is we have them communicate. That improves efficiency.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.040
So we can improve efficiency by having parts of the brain talk to each other all the time.

20:52.040 --> 20:55.040
There's a problem with that. Two problems is when the brain is talking a lot to itself,

20:55.040 --> 20:59.040
it's not paying much attention to the world.

20:59.040 --> 21:05.040
Secondly, when all that energy is being expended, it's very expensive.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.040
This is what the brain does.

21:08.040 --> 21:12.040
It actually does, has different areas of the brain.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.040
They model each other. They mutually model each other.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.040
And then the brain cycles.

21:17.040 --> 21:22.040
It cycles between you're focused on the world, right,

21:22.040 --> 21:25.040
and all the parts are relying on the model of each other to coordinate

21:25.040 --> 21:28.040
without talking to each other very much, so all of that energy can be channeled.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.040
And then it goes to another time when you're basically not focused on the world

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
and all the parts are talking to each other.

21:33.040 --> 21:36.040
Your attention is trying to do it right now.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.040
Because part of your attention is task focused.

21:38.040 --> 21:43.040
What is he going to say next? He's so weird.

21:43.040 --> 21:48.040
And then there's another part of you that is trying to mind-wander.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.040
Mind-wandering is when you disconnect from the world

21:51.040 --> 21:55.040
and the parts are basically talking to each other for what purpose?

21:55.040 --> 21:59.040
Mind-wandering.

21:59.040 --> 22:02.040
It seems like the most useless thing and you spend so much time in mind-wandering

22:02.040 --> 22:07.040
because this is when the models all connect and make sure they're tracking each other

22:07.040 --> 22:10.040
and you cycle back and forth and your attention is trying to do it right now.

22:10.040 --> 22:13.040
And then you get an advantage out of that.

22:13.040 --> 22:18.040
The mind-wandering opens up variations of things and perspectives that are relevant to you

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
because you're always the hero of your mind-wandering.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
You don't mind-wander.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.040
Hey, I'm going to mind-wander about Pete Seeger or somebody else.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.040
You mind? It's always you.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.040
It's you. How are things relevant to me?

22:30.040 --> 22:35.040
In fact, what's happening is, you know, John Veracchis, it's not really relevant to me.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
Here's a bunch of stuff that's relevant to me.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
That's mind-wandering.

22:39.040 --> 22:44.040
And then what you do is you open up the possibilities of how things are relevant.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.040
You open up variation on what you can pay attention to

22:46.040 --> 22:50.040
and then you kill most of it off when you come back to focusing on me.

22:50.040 --> 22:54.040
But some of it stays and you make connections that are relevant to you.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.040
You evolve your attentional fit.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
Variation with the mind-wandering.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.040
Selection with the task focus.

23:01.040 --> 23:07.040
And you do this and you're evolving your connectedness.

23:07.040 --> 23:14.040
We figured out with home range and home base how to do that with collective intelligence.

23:14.040 --> 23:19.040
We all go out with our mutual models and then we come back into common unity, the community,

23:19.040 --> 23:23.040
and we do all this stuff that seems relatively useless so that we, right,

23:24.040 --> 23:30.040
and the whole community evolves its grip on the world.

23:42.040 --> 23:49.040
So this interaction between home range and home base starts to evolve

23:49.040 --> 23:53.040
and develop intelligence, collective intelligence,

23:53.040 --> 23:56.040
the intelligence of distributed cognition.

23:56.040 --> 24:00.040
And then of course what happens is individual cognition and collective cognition

24:00.040 --> 24:04.040
start to bootstrap each other.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.040
If I internalize her and she internalizes me,

24:08.040 --> 24:11.040
she can actually take my perspective on her perspective.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
That's what she's doing when she's doing that coordinated.

24:13.040 --> 24:16.040
But then she can just do that when she needs to.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.040
Not just when she's coordinating with me.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.040
I can, what would John think?

24:20.040 --> 24:23.040
What would Jonathan, what would Paul think?

24:23.040 --> 24:28.040
Oh, your metacognitive capacities expand dramatically.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.040
Your ability to be aware of how you're aware, to know how you're knowing,

24:32.040 --> 24:37.040
to learn how to learn all goes up significantly.

24:37.040 --> 24:43.040
This is all enmeshed with home range and home base.

24:44.040 --> 24:50.040
But how is the home base chosen?

24:50.040 --> 24:53.040
Well, think about campfire.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.040
How do you choose it?

24:56.040 --> 25:00.040
So there's a theory, we've got to modify the theory because the empirical record

25:00.040 --> 25:03.040
for the initial presentation of the theory has made up and modified.

25:03.040 --> 25:06.040
The original theory is prospect and refuge.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.040
Prospect and refuge says you're always looking for places where you have

25:10.040 --> 25:13.040
significant prospects so you can see a lot.

25:13.040 --> 25:17.040
But there's refuge for you.

25:17.040 --> 25:21.040
Now, originally they thought that was, like, I want to be able to see a lot,

25:21.040 --> 25:24.040
but I want to be able to hide a lot.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.040
And that turns out to be wrong.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.040
Because it makes predictions.

25:28.040 --> 25:32.040
You show people pictures of, like, here's all this expanse you can see,

25:32.040 --> 25:35.040
but you're also sort of in a jungle and people don't want to be there.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.040
Because here's the thing, if you could hide in it, so could someone else.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.040
So could a predator.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.040
So you don't want lots of hiding places.

25:43.040 --> 25:49.040
So it's more like what I want in refuge is I want a place where I can defend myself

25:49.040 --> 25:53.040
or escape, reliably escape.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.040
So when I say refuge, I want you to hear that, okay?

25:56.040 --> 25:58.040
Now think about this, because I've been thinking about this

25:58.040 --> 26:02.040
and what Paul was saying about rest and how it's not just lastitude.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.040
And I was thinking, what went through my head was this phrase,

26:04.040 --> 26:09.040
a refuge without prospect is a prison.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.040
And prospect without refuge is wilderness.

26:12.040 --> 26:15.040
You don't want either of those.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.040
You don't want either of those.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.040
So this might surprise you that I would make this move.

26:22.040 --> 26:28.040
You're seeking for an optimal grip between that trade-off relationship.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.040
And so you're trying to pick a place.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.040
So you've got all this affordance network.

26:33.040 --> 26:39.040
You want a place that gives you this sort of optimal grip between prospect and refuge.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.040
It's a nexus point.

26:40.040 --> 26:46.040
It gives you easy access to many different courses of action you can undertake.

26:50.040 --> 26:54.040
Now I want you to think about what a way of thinking about that.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.040
I'm going to use a martial arts analogy.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
I think I used it in Thunder Bay, but I'm going to use it again.

26:58.040 --> 27:01.040
It's a slightly different one, okay?

27:02.040 --> 27:06.040
So the reason I'm using this is because I'm going to really play on optimal gripping.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.040
There's things when you're doing and you're grappling with somebody

27:08.040 --> 27:11.040
and you need to get literally the optimal grip on them to throw them.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
Like you don't want to lean too far forward because then they can,

27:13.040 --> 27:16.040
you know, that's not going to, you got to do this thing.

27:16.040 --> 27:22.040
So there's all these different things you're doing that are optimal grips on your opponent.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
But you don't start out that way.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.040
You start out, you take your stance.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.040
Now this doesn't do anything.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.040
You don't use this for anything.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
What's the point of a stance?

27:32.040 --> 27:36.040
So think about all the optimal grippings I can have.

27:36.040 --> 27:42.040
The stance puts me in an optimal place to get to any of those optimal gripping.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.040
Do you understand?

27:43.040 --> 27:47.040
The stance allows me, oh, if I hear, I can quickly,

27:47.040 --> 27:50.040
if I'm here, I can, right, I can quickly step back if I need to.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.040
I can come over.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.040
I can, right, there's all these things I can do from the stance.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.040
You have a stance.

27:58.040 --> 28:02.040
It's, it's your meta optimal grip.

28:02.040 --> 28:07.040
And I have to have a few metas or you wouldn't believe it was me giving the talk, right?

28:07.040 --> 28:10.040
It's your meta optimal grip point.

28:10.040 --> 28:17.040
And it's at the point that gives you the best optimal relationship between prospect and refuge.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
And then you have this point.

28:19.040 --> 28:24.040
It's the point that is your entry into the affordance network.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
It's giving you meta optimal grip.

28:28.040 --> 28:34.040
It's an origin point for all of the journeys that you're going to take and you're going to come back to.

28:37.040 --> 28:45.040
It allows you to navigate your home range and to share that with other people

28:45.040 --> 28:51.040
because we can all mutually model the origin point so that we can easily coordinate our behavior.

28:55.040 --> 29:01.040
So that you get the ability to undertake what's called orientation.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.040
This is the work of Stegmeyer.

29:04.040 --> 29:09.040
2019 is an astonishing book on orientation, the philosophy of orientation.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.040
And he talks about how orient the ability.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.040
Okay.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.040
So if you were to ask many people today how they're wrestling with things,

29:17.040 --> 29:22.040
they will use metaphors or they will even use the word I feel disoriented.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.040
I don't know which way is up or down.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.040
I don't know which way to go.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.040
And it's all metaphorical.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.040
They're talking about this fundamental ability of orientation.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.040
Right.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.040
When we orient, I want to coin a word.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
I don't know if it's a word.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.040
I want to talk about co-orientation like the way we talk about coordination.

29:45.040 --> 29:51.040
We have co-orientation when we have the home base.

29:52.040 --> 29:58.040
And we take that up into our worldview and we can navigate the worldview.

29:59.040 --> 30:04.040
We can co-orient in that worldview and move around in that space

30:05.040 --> 30:09.040
so that we can coordinate our distributed cognition,

30:09.040 --> 30:12.040
access that collective intelligence.

30:12.040 --> 30:17.040
That's what orientation does for you, shared orientation.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.040
We even do it.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.040
We even do it temporally.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.040
We've been talking about this.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.040
Right.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.040
We have retrospective.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.040
Right.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.040
We have this retrospective.

30:33.040 --> 30:38.040
We want, remember I didn't mean rest.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.040
Sorry, I didn't mean hiding.

30:41.040 --> 30:48.040
The path should provide some kind of refuge for us now.

30:48.040 --> 30:52.040
It should have, all of these things should have converged

30:52.040 --> 30:56.040
so that we have a trustworthy home base

30:56.040 --> 30:59.040
that then gives us prospect for the future.

30:59.040 --> 31:02.040
We feel so that we can properly do this.

31:02.040 --> 31:06.040
We can, there's a common unity

31:06.040 --> 31:09.040
that gives us a common law of the precedent

31:09.040 --> 31:13.040
that has been vouchsafed to us from the past.

31:13.040 --> 31:18.040
And then it encourages us to be prospectively responsible

31:18.040 --> 31:21.040
and try and set precedent for the people in the future.

31:21.040 --> 31:25.040
And this of course is random's work on reason and philosophy,

31:25.040 --> 31:27.040
his new interpretation of Hegel.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.040
And that what we're trying to do is constantly find ourselves

31:30.040 --> 31:34.040
in that stream, in that course of the common law

31:34.040 --> 31:36.040
of distributed cognition.

31:36.040 --> 31:41.040
We can draw from the past and we can prospect to the future

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
and then we are oriented.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.040
Then we are oriented.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.040
So, we've got the home base

31:58.040 --> 32:01.040
and it's within the home range

32:01.040 --> 32:04.040
and then all of this is within the horizon.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.040
But with the home base and the home range

32:08.040 --> 32:10.040
we have this sort of resonance field

32:10.040 --> 32:14.040
in which the land flows, we belong to it.

32:14.040 --> 32:18.040
And then on top of it we have this ability to orient

32:18.040 --> 32:21.040
and to co-orient and to form community

32:21.040 --> 32:25.040
and access not only the community here now

32:25.040 --> 32:28.040
but the community of the past and the community of the future.

32:28.040 --> 32:31.040
And I take it that Christians represent that

32:31.040 --> 32:34.040
with the community of the saints and things like that.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.040
Or at least some branch of Christians.

32:37.040 --> 32:40.040
I have to be honest, sometimes I can't keep all of you straight.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.040
And I say that affectionately.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.040
So what happens with this orientation

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
is remember with the first thing,

32:50.040 --> 32:53.040
space became places linked by paths.

32:53.040 --> 32:57.040
Now the paths and the places are transformed into maps.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.040
Cognitive maps.

33:02.040 --> 33:05.040
And a map is a powerful thing.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.040
And then what Descartes did, by the way,

33:07.040 --> 33:09.040
he figured out how to take our mapping ability

33:09.040 --> 33:12.040
and our orienting ability and turn it into a graph

33:12.040 --> 33:14.040
because that's all it is.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.040
It's a mapping from an origin point.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.040
That's why it's called the origin point, by the way,

33:19.040 --> 33:21.040
on a Cartesian graph.

33:23.040 --> 33:27.040
See, what a map does is it reduces your cognitive load.

33:29.040 --> 33:32.040
You don't have to remember all the idiosyncratic paths and pathways.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.040
You don't have to, by the way, in the dark times,

33:36.040 --> 33:38.040
you didn't have Siri,

33:38.040 --> 33:43.040
we would go to the glove box

33:45.040 --> 33:47.040
and we would retrieve the parchment.

33:47.040 --> 33:52.040
We called them maps and we would open the map.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.040
And I had never trod this path or been in that place.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.040
But I could find my way.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.040
I didn't have to.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.040
See, once you have a map,

34:04.040 --> 34:07.040
you don't have to hold all the paths and places.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
Imagine if your environment was the way you treat your house.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
You had to memorize it.

34:13.040 --> 34:16.040
So your range gets limited when you don't have cognitive maps.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.040
When you have cognitive maps,

34:18.040 --> 34:23.040
you can go to all kinds of places you haven't been before

34:23.040 --> 34:25.040
with confidence.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.040
I encourage you to interpolate, extrapolate,

34:28.040 --> 34:33.040
to go into the unknown with a kind of confidence.

34:37.040 --> 34:41.040
It charges that space.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.040
Sorry, that's not even right.

34:43.040 --> 34:46.040
It charges that relationship between the home base,

34:46.040 --> 34:48.040
the home range and the horizon.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.040
It charges it.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.040
It becomes a resonance field.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.040
It's resonant with possibilities for you

34:54.040 --> 34:58.040
because you won't be overwhelmed because you have the map.

35:08.040 --> 35:12.040
So now you see the belonging and the co-orienting are actually,

35:12.040 --> 35:14.040
they're not being left behind.

35:14.040 --> 35:19.040
They're mutually nested within each other, growing each other.

35:19.040 --> 35:23.040
Now we move to the third, which is the hearth and hospital.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.040
Now I need you to hear something.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.040
The word hospital.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.040
Hear it the way it originally was meant in the word hospitality.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.040
So sometime after we started home basing,

35:38.040 --> 35:40.040
our ancestors get fire.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.040
And they start to reliably use it.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.040
And there's a lot of dispute about how ancient that is,

35:47.040 --> 35:51.040
but it's reliably we've got evidence for 500,000 years.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.040
Some older sites maybe we don't know.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.040
And we don't know, like if we don't quite know

35:56.040 --> 36:00.040
if the home basing is first and the fire comes along

36:00.040 --> 36:02.040
or the fire and the home basing come together.

36:02.040 --> 36:04.040
We don't know.

36:04.040 --> 36:06.040
I'm just giving you, so I'm talking more about stages

36:06.040 --> 36:09.040
than perhaps the actual historical sequence.

36:09.040 --> 36:13.040
What happens around the hearth in the hospital?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.040
Healing.

36:15.040 --> 36:20.040
We start to really start to heal each other when we're sick,

36:20.040 --> 36:22.040
when we're wounded.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.040
And that again seems as the natural thing to do for you.

36:25.040 --> 36:31.040
It's not, right, for most organisms, right?

36:31.040 --> 36:34.040
Of course, we have now the nursery.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.040
And think about how the nursery and the healing overlap.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.040
We talk about nurses.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.040
They're not raising children.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.040
They're healing the sick.

36:42.040 --> 36:45.040
We see a relationship between those.

36:45.040 --> 36:48.040
Now what's happening when you have the home base

36:48.040 --> 36:53.040
and the hearth is you've got the extension of agopic love

36:53.040 --> 36:59.040
from the mother and the child to the extended family.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.040
That is a huge, huge advantage.

37:02.040 --> 37:07.040
That's a huge advantage.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.040
This is why for many people, people who don't have houses,

37:10.040 --> 37:13.040
like the indigenous people in Australia,

37:13.040 --> 37:14.040
they don't have houses.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.040
They have kinship systems.

37:16.040 --> 37:21.040
That's how they feel at home.

37:21.040 --> 37:25.040
And they're really, like, it's hard to figure out.

37:25.040 --> 37:27.040
It's so complex, even convoluted,

37:27.040 --> 37:30.040
and sophisticated the way the kinship systems work

37:30.040 --> 37:33.040
and the way you name people so that, like,

37:33.040 --> 37:34.040
you're my mother-in-law.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.040
What?

37:35.040 --> 37:39.040
Well, because, and it's just, like, it's bizarre.

37:39.040 --> 37:42.040
Like, I'm struggling to understand it from the outside,

37:42.040 --> 37:45.040
but all I know is it's impressive.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.040
There's, of course, food sharing,

37:47.040 --> 37:49.040
and we still do that.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.040
We just did it.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.040
Until we had phones in the dark time,

37:55.040 --> 37:57.040
eating up, you'd go to a restaurant

37:57.040 --> 37:58.040
and you ate by yourself.

37:58.040 --> 38:03.040
It was awful.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.040
Or that's, so there's the looker,

38:06.040 --> 38:10.040
or there's the ignorer.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.040
Now what we do is we pretend that we're important

38:12.040 --> 38:15.040
and we're obviously involved with something new.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.040
My phone.

38:17.040 --> 38:21.040
The president's talking to me.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.040
Right?

38:22.040 --> 38:24.040
And, of course, as I said, there's social bonding.

38:24.040 --> 38:28.040
But think about what's also going on in the hearth.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.040
There's the fire.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.040
And what I said,

38:33.040 --> 38:35.040
to really pick up on what Jonathan was saying,

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
think about what fire is.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.040
Fire shines and it withdraws at the same time.

38:40.040 --> 38:44.040
You can follow it, but you can't grab it.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.040
It's about, so you're in this place

38:46.040 --> 38:48.040
where all these transformations are happening.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.040
The kitchen is a transformation.

38:49.040 --> 38:52.040
The food, the child rearing, the healing,

38:52.040 --> 38:53.040
all this transformation.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.040
And then you've got this incarnation of transformation,

38:57.040 --> 39:00.040
elusively present there.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.040
And Matt Rosano has talked about,

39:02.040 --> 39:04.040
like, that being around campfires

39:04.040 --> 39:07.040
probably affected, right,

39:07.040 --> 39:09.040
in the niche construction manner,

39:09.040 --> 39:11.040
the evolution of our intelligence.

39:11.040 --> 39:17.040
Because fire is hypnotic.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.040
It's amazing.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.040
Human beings...

39:19.040 --> 39:26.040
You light a fire in there.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.040
And part of the problem with the video world

39:28.040 --> 39:30.040
is it generates the campfire effect,

39:30.040 --> 39:33.040
but there's no campfire.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.040
Pause on that.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.040
See, when I'm in a campfire,

39:36.040 --> 39:38.040
your face is lit and only your face,

39:38.040 --> 39:40.040
and I don't see the rest of you,

39:40.040 --> 39:42.040
like a video screen,

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
which is lit and I don't see the rest of you.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.040
You're very close.

39:45.040 --> 39:48.040
You're closer than you normally are with somebody at a campfire.

39:48.040 --> 39:50.040
Same with the video screen.

39:50.040 --> 39:54.040
But we don't have a common origin.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
We don't have the fire.

39:55.040 --> 40:01.040
We don't have the fire reminding us of the reality,

40:01.040 --> 40:03.040
of how being shines forth,

40:03.040 --> 40:06.040
but always also withdraws.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.040
And no wonder that Heraclitus,

40:08.040 --> 40:12.040
who brought the notion of the logos into philosophical

40:12.040 --> 40:15.040
and then ultimately religious use,

40:15.040 --> 40:21.040
chose the fire as the symbol of the logos.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.040
And we talk about conversations that catch fire,

40:24.040 --> 40:27.040
because fire has its ability to catch and organize and grow.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.040
It shines and withdraws.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.040
It appears and it disappears.

40:30.040 --> 40:31.040
And this is reality.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.040
And what we can do with the fire,

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
which is so chaotic,

40:35.040 --> 40:38.040
is we can get into symbolic resonance with it.

40:38.040 --> 40:42.040
It can make us aware of the transformation that's happening in us.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.040
And then we can see more in the fire

40:44.040 --> 40:46.040
than just its superficial presence.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.040
We start to see more deeply into it,

40:48.040 --> 40:51.040
and it starts to disclose something more deeply into us,

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
and we symbolically resonance,

40:53.040 --> 40:56.040
and we start to get ontological depth perception happening.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.040
And then we also start doing that with each other around the campfire.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.040
I open myself up so you can see into me,

41:01.040 --> 41:04.040
and you open yourself up so you can see into me.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.040
And we do this, and we reciprocally open,

41:06.040 --> 41:08.040
and we get ontological depth perception.

41:08.040 --> 41:13.040
So what's happening is

41:13.040 --> 41:19.040
we start to do things that the kids are already doing around the hearth.

41:19.040 --> 41:24.040
Symbolically resonant, serious play called ritual.

41:24.040 --> 41:29.040
Imaginally augmented perception and conception.

41:29.040 --> 41:32.040
The serious play designed not for any goal,

41:32.040 --> 41:38.040
but for transformation itself.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
And there's a process there.

41:40.040 --> 41:44.040
Rituals have a rationality to them.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.040
It's not the rationality of propositions.

41:46.040 --> 41:50.040
A ritual is rational, ratio, properly proportioned,

41:50.040 --> 41:55.040
if it transfers broadly and deeply outside of the context

41:55.040 --> 41:58.040
in which the ritual is practiced.

41:58.040 --> 42:00.040
The point isn't in the ritual.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.040
It is, but it isn't.

42:02.040 --> 42:05.040
What I mean is, if the ritual just stays in the ritual,

42:05.040 --> 42:08.040
Kierkegaard has this wonderful parable about this.

42:08.040 --> 42:10.040
There's a bunch of geese, they walk into a church,

42:10.040 --> 42:15.040
and they all sing about flying, and then they walk out.

42:15.040 --> 42:18.040
And he said, that's a lot of Christianity today.

42:18.040 --> 42:23.040
And he's a Christian.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.040
Fire walking, fire.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.040
Fire walking is a ritual around the world.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.040
Why? It seems so bizarre and strange.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.040
What's going on?

42:31.040 --> 42:33.040
Well, here's what's going on.

42:33.040 --> 42:37.040
When I'm walking on coals, they're actually slow conductors of heat.

42:37.040 --> 42:41.040
So if I walk fast enough, I won't get burned.

42:41.040 --> 42:44.040
But if I walk too fast, I'll kick up the coals and I'll get burned.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
So I have to get my timing just right.

42:46.040 --> 42:51.040
So I have all of this mindfulness about, I get right,

42:51.040 --> 42:54.040
very mindful of a situation, so I get the timing just right.

42:54.040 --> 42:57.040
Now, do you think that ability transfers broadly and deeply in your life?

42:57.040 --> 43:00.040
You better believe it.

43:00.040 --> 43:05.040
So fire walking, the fire.

43:05.040 --> 43:13.040
We get that in the hearth.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.040
So what's happening here?

43:14.040 --> 43:19.040
Well, at that origin point that's been horizontal, the map,

43:19.040 --> 43:22.040
we now get the vertical intersecting.

43:22.040 --> 43:28.040
We discover spaces below and spaces above and how to navigate those spaces

43:28.040 --> 43:30.040
and return to the origin point.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.040
And this is ancient.

43:32.040 --> 43:36.040
We've got clear evidence of at least 15,000 years ago of shamans

43:36.040 --> 43:38.040
and the three-tiered cosmos.

43:38.040 --> 43:48.040
There's the underworld, this world, and the overworld.

43:48.040 --> 43:52.040
There's the pathological depth perception, navigating it.

43:52.040 --> 43:58.040
We're taking all of these other skills from the home range and the home base

43:58.040 --> 44:03.040
and we're taking them up into the ritualization and the transformation

44:03.040 --> 44:07.040
around the hearth and the hospital and we're getting the vertical dimension

44:07.040 --> 44:10.040
and where the vertical dimension intersects the origin point,

44:10.040 --> 44:13.040
you have the axis mundi.

44:13.040 --> 44:16.040
And as Jonathan is frequently pointing out to you,

44:16.040 --> 44:24.040
that's what the cross and the tree represent, if I understand him correctly.

44:24.040 --> 44:27.040
And you nod when those symbols come out,

44:27.040 --> 44:30.040
but try to be abstract for a moment and step outside of it.

44:30.040 --> 44:31.040
It's like me coming up to you and saying,

44:31.040 --> 44:38.040
it's all about the squirrel and the wash basin.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.040
What?

44:40.040 --> 44:42.040
But if I say, it's all about this axis mundi,

44:42.040 --> 44:45.040
this tree that grows to the depths and to the heights.

44:46.040 --> 44:58.040
And of course, trees are also the source of wood which provides fire.

44:58.040 --> 45:06.040
Okay.

45:06.040 --> 45:16.040
So, all of this is being lost.

45:16.040 --> 45:19.040
You might have heard me talk about this.

45:19.040 --> 45:24.040
We're all experiencing domicile.

45:24.040 --> 45:29.040
So, Kellyanne Allen who does work on belonging.

45:29.040 --> 45:35.040
Belonging is declining massively and quickly with horrible consequences.

45:35.040 --> 45:38.040
Undeniable empirical evidence.

45:38.040 --> 45:43.040
One sure measure, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?

45:43.040 --> 45:48.040
No matter how connected we are, how many close friends do you have reliably going down?

45:48.040 --> 45:52.040
How much of your days are lonely, reliably going up?

45:52.040 --> 45:53.040
Just one measure.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.040
There's many other measures just to give you a clear example of that.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.040
You know, and this is like, I've said this before,

45:59.040 --> 46:01.040
this is like something out of Orwell.

46:01.040 --> 46:06.040
The United Kingdom has set up a ministry of loneliness

46:06.040 --> 46:10.040
because they figured out that if they don't fix this problem,

46:10.040 --> 46:16.040
they're in a lot of trouble.

46:16.040 --> 46:20.040
Of course, I don't think the United States will do such a thing

46:20.040 --> 46:23.040
and Canada isn't doing anything right now.

46:23.040 --> 46:32.040
So, all that religio, meaning in life, belongingness,

46:32.040 --> 46:37.040
worldview, attunement, that's all going away.

46:37.040 --> 46:41.040
The loss of our awareness and appreciation of the non-propositional,

46:41.040 --> 46:46.040
knowing so that we can rightly and deeply participate in ritual.

46:46.040 --> 46:49.040
Notice how the word ritual, post-Freud,

46:49.040 --> 46:55.040
has become the way of talking about an obsessive pathology.

46:55.040 --> 47:02.040
That's how far we've come.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.040
And of course, as Brian Wallace said,

47:04.040 --> 47:08.040
home is where we take the symbols that are in our,

47:08.040 --> 47:13.040
like right there, pregnant, like the path that's right there.

47:13.040 --> 47:16.040
And that's how I think, it's how I think about intentionality.

47:16.040 --> 47:19.040
We take the symbols right there, ready to be birthed,

47:19.040 --> 47:22.040
and then we have to set it into a ritual community,

47:22.040 --> 47:25.040
and that is what we do to make a home.

47:25.040 --> 47:29.040
A home is a machine in which symbol and ritual come together.

47:29.040 --> 47:32.040
And if you don't think that's what a home is,

47:32.040 --> 47:38.040
skip Christmas next time and see how everybody reacts around it.

47:38.040 --> 47:40.040
No, we're just not going to do Christmas this year.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.040
We're not going to decorate, we're not going to do this.

47:44.040 --> 47:48.040
People will hate you in a way you've never been hated before.

47:56.040 --> 48:03.040
We've lost co-orientation, origin point, the vertical.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
We've been reduced to the horizontal.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
We've lost the Axis Mundi.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.040
But as I've tried to show,

48:09.040 --> 48:12.040
all of those things are part of who and what we are.

48:12.040 --> 48:18.040
So as they have come into question, we have come into question.

48:24.040 --> 48:30.040
We are in question in a way, and Heidegger is the prophet of this.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.040
He says we are the beings whose being is in question.

48:35.040 --> 48:39.040
And the fact that we lack an ability to wonder in that fashion

48:39.040 --> 48:43.040
is precisely what he says is one of the origins of nihilism for us.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.040
So when we wonder, we call ourselves in the world into question.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
But we also wander.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
Wandering is when we're disoriented and we don't know where to go.

48:52.040 --> 48:56.040
So we're wondering and wandering as we're in question,

48:56.040 --> 49:00.040
as we're seeking orientation, as we're trying to find the origin

49:00.040 --> 49:03.040
that will put us into right relationship to the horizon.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
And that is exactly what a quest is.

49:05.040 --> 49:09.040
The word quest and question are related for a deep reason.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.040
In a quest, you are what's in question.

49:12.040 --> 49:15.040
You're wondering as you're wandering.

49:15.040 --> 49:20.040
There is no answer to the question without the transformation

49:20.040 --> 49:23.040
that is brought about by undergoing the quest.

49:27.040 --> 49:30.040
We need a reciprocal reconstruction of our worldview.

49:30.040 --> 49:34.040
We need to bring back the reinventio of co-orientation.

49:34.040 --> 49:38.040
We need the reinventio of symbolic resonance and ritual.

49:38.040 --> 49:41.040
We need to do this in a coordinated fashion.

49:44.040 --> 49:47.040
We started not on time. How much time do I have left?

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
Pardon me?

49:52.040 --> 49:54.040
Nine minutes.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.040
That's perfect. Nine's good. I'm happy.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.040
Okay.

49:59.040 --> 50:09.040
So, part of what has to do,

50:09.040 --> 50:14.040
and I really had this in my notes before Jonathan gave his talk,

50:14.040 --> 50:21.040
part of it has to do with a relationship.

50:21.040 --> 50:26.040
We have to get back to this fundamental orientation point

50:26.040 --> 50:28.040
in our meta-optimal gripping.

50:28.040 --> 50:32.040
We have to get all the way back there because that's how deep the problem is.

50:32.040 --> 50:37.040
Attempting to solve the problem anywhere that's more shallow than that

50:37.040 --> 50:41.040
won't give us the transformation of the ontological depth perception that we need.

50:43.040 --> 50:49.040
We have to get back to that orientation, which we're so badly lacking.

50:49.040 --> 50:55.040
The problem is, when you lack orientation, you don't know which way to go to get it.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.040
So, you can see the 20th...

51:01.040 --> 51:04.040
Well, you can see actually all of the centuries since the Enlightenment

51:04.040 --> 51:07.040
is us thrashing around, trying to...

51:07.040 --> 51:12.040
First of all, what we'll do is we'll get an absolute foundation in science and math,

51:12.040 --> 51:16.040
and that will be our origin and that fell apart.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.040
What we'll do is we'll actually...

51:19.040 --> 51:22.040
We'll take into our hands technology and we'll build the...

51:22.040 --> 51:24.040
Oh, no.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.040
In fact, right?

51:28.040 --> 51:31.040
And I don't want to talk about this too much, right?

51:31.040 --> 51:33.040
Well, if you want to talk about it, I'll talk about it.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.040
I don't want to talk about it right now.

51:35.040 --> 51:39.040
But the advent of AGI, which is now on the horizon,

51:39.040 --> 51:45.040
and if you hear one thing I say to you,

51:45.040 --> 51:48.040
it's don't pretend that's not the case.

51:49.040 --> 51:51.040
Don't pretend that's not the case.

51:51.040 --> 51:54.040
We need the very best from all of us right now

51:54.040 --> 51:57.040
and pretending it's not the case is not helping.

51:57.040 --> 51:59.040
It is harming.

52:04.040 --> 52:08.040
So, what do we need to do?

52:10.040 --> 52:14.040
We have to get to this ability where we can reorient

52:14.040 --> 52:18.040
because the advent of AI has said to us,

52:18.040 --> 52:21.040
the promise of the Enlightenment, not the promise of Enlightenment,

52:21.040 --> 52:23.040
that's a different thing.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.040
The promise of the Enlightenment.

52:25.040 --> 52:28.040
The Promethean promise.

52:28.040 --> 52:33.040
We have discovered that history is not about God or being

52:33.040 --> 52:36.040
or the true or the good or the beautiful.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.040
History is about us.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.040
We are the authors of history.

52:40.040 --> 52:41.040
We are the telos.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.040
We are the point of history.

52:42.040 --> 52:45.040
The point of history is to bring us to completion

52:45.040 --> 52:48.040
as free agents in the world.

52:48.040 --> 52:49.040
What's freedom?

52:49.040 --> 52:50.040
Don't ask that.

52:50.040 --> 52:52.040
Freedom, freedom.

52:55.040 --> 52:57.040
And there's a lot of good...

52:57.040 --> 53:00.040
I don't want to live in a world before the Enlightenment.

53:01.040 --> 53:06.040
But we paid this price because we started down a course of action

53:06.040 --> 53:09.040
that has got us to the...

53:10.040 --> 53:14.040
I work with Jeffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.

53:14.040 --> 53:17.040
He is the Godfather of artificial intelligence.

53:17.040 --> 53:21.040
He quit his job so that he could speak freely

53:21.040 --> 53:24.040
about the serious danger we're in right now.

53:28.040 --> 53:30.040
The Enlightenment promised all of this,

53:30.040 --> 53:33.040
and then we get to this place where we told,

53:33.040 --> 53:35.040
oh, by the way, you weren't what this was all about,

53:35.040 --> 53:38.040
and you are no longer the authors of history.

53:38.040 --> 53:41.040
And you actually aren't going to matter very soon.

53:44.040 --> 53:47.040
We tried that, and then we tried the vacillation

53:47.040 --> 53:50.040
between various utopias and nostalgias,

53:50.040 --> 53:52.040
and we fight bloody, titanic wars over it,

53:52.040 --> 53:55.040
and it's all for bloody nothing.

54:01.040 --> 54:03.040
Jonathan spoke of a sacrifice.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.040
We need to make a profound sacrifice

54:07.040 --> 54:10.040
to get back to the point where reorientation is possible,

54:10.040 --> 54:13.040
so that co-orientation is possible,

54:13.040 --> 54:16.040
so that real community is possible.

54:20.040 --> 54:23.040
We have to get to a kind...

54:25.040 --> 54:27.040
See, I want to talk about something,

54:27.040 --> 54:30.040
but I don't want you to hear a particular state.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.040
I want you to hear the possibility

54:32.040 --> 54:35.040
for the transformation of character that's in this.

54:37.040 --> 54:40.040
So this goes to some of my scientific work.

54:40.040 --> 54:43.040
I was at a monastery, Buddhist monastery,

54:43.040 --> 54:45.040
just to keep things even,

54:45.040 --> 54:48.040
I'm going to a Christian monastery after I'm here.

54:48.040 --> 54:51.040
All balanced, and it's an Eastern Orthodox one,

54:51.040 --> 54:53.040
so there you go, Jonathan.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.040
But I was in a Buddhist monastery,

54:58.040 --> 55:00.040
and I was talking about all the relevance realizations,

55:00.040 --> 55:02.040
and I got talking to them,

55:02.040 --> 55:04.040
and there was this sort of creative tension,

55:04.040 --> 55:06.040
and I had a bunch of insights,

55:06.040 --> 55:08.040
and it was in dialogue with other people,

55:08.040 --> 55:11.040
something that had always been sort of like,

55:11.040 --> 55:13.040
what is the proper stance,

55:13.040 --> 55:16.040
stance, orientation,

55:16.040 --> 55:19.040
towards being and the ground of being?

55:22.040 --> 55:24.040
We don't ask that question, we presuppose we have answers,

55:24.040 --> 55:26.040
but we don't have answers anymore,

55:26.040 --> 55:28.040
and we got to get back to that.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.040
What is the proper stance?

55:32.040 --> 55:35.040
What are all these places that people are getting to

55:35.040 --> 55:37.040
in their mind and spirit?

55:37.040 --> 55:41.040
I don't care which entity you posit at being in right now.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.040
And then I realized something,

55:43.040 --> 55:45.040
and it helped me make sense of what I was reading

55:45.040 --> 55:47.040
in the Tate Chen,

55:47.040 --> 55:49.040
what I'm reading in Dojin,

55:49.040 --> 55:52.040
and actually also what I'm reading in Maximus.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.040
I hope that doesn't offend anybody,

55:56.040 --> 55:59.040
because I mean it with affection.

56:02.040 --> 56:06.040
Relevance realization is about our optimal gripping on things.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.040
We even have a meta-optimal grip.

56:08.040 --> 56:10.040
We have to get past that.

56:12.040 --> 56:15.040
We have to start, that's what Jonathan was arguing.

56:15.040 --> 56:17.040
We have to stop grasping.

56:17.040 --> 56:21.040
Paul was doing it too about the restless resting.

56:25.040 --> 56:29.040
Relevance realization can come to the realization

56:29.040 --> 56:32.040
that it itself is irrelevant.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.040
That what is not needed anymore

56:36.040 --> 56:38.040
is what relevance realization does,

56:38.040 --> 56:40.040
which is optimally gripped.

56:40.040 --> 56:43.040
Because relevance realization is how I get into relationship

56:43.040 --> 56:47.040
to this being, to this being, to this being, to this being,

56:47.040 --> 56:49.040
to all of these beings.

56:49.040 --> 56:52.040
But when I want to be in relationship to the ground of being,

56:52.040 --> 56:55.040
I have to give up relevance realization.

56:55.040 --> 56:59.040
I have to get to a state where I give up

56:59.040 --> 57:04.040
that most fundamental human need to grasp.

57:05.040 --> 57:07.040
And it's hard for us to think of it.

57:07.040 --> 57:10.040
This metaphor is the comprandra.

57:10.040 --> 57:13.040
This is the metaphor for getting it, for understanding.

57:13.040 --> 57:16.040
But I won't understand, I can't write.

57:19.040 --> 57:23.040
But then you get what you really want.

57:24.040 --> 57:28.040
You get the place where you have the stance.

57:30.040 --> 57:34.040
Towards being, towards the grounded being,

57:34.040 --> 57:38.040
towards the no-thingness behind and within.

57:38.040 --> 57:41.040
Maximus has this great thing, right?

57:41.040 --> 57:43.040
I really love it, where he says,

57:43.040 --> 57:47.040
God is inside of everything but not enclosed.

57:47.040 --> 57:50.040
God is beyond everything but not excluded.

57:51.040 --> 57:54.040
You can't get that with a graspy mind.

57:54.040 --> 57:57.040
You can't get that with a graspy mind.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.040
It's inside.

58:00.040 --> 58:03.040
I don't have it, it's outside.

58:05.040 --> 58:07.040
I'm sorry, this is exciting to me.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.040
You're all just sort of here.

58:09.040 --> 58:14.040
But look, this is like, when I did Lexio on it,

58:14.040 --> 58:18.040
it's like, God is inside everything but not enclosed,

58:18.040 --> 58:20.040
not imprisoned.

58:20.040 --> 58:22.040
God is beyond everything but not excluded.

58:22.040 --> 58:28.040
And I kept going, how do I get there with a grasping mind?

58:28.040 --> 58:30.040
You can't.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.040
You can't.

58:34.040 --> 58:37.040
When you grieve up all your grasping,

58:37.040 --> 58:41.040
you give up the nexus center point of all the grasping.

58:41.040 --> 58:43.040
You get opened up.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.040
I think it's a kind of deep depth,

58:46.040 --> 58:48.040
like Jonathan was talking about,

58:48.040 --> 58:50.040
with the possibility of a resurrection.

58:50.040 --> 58:54.040
If we have the stance to the ground of being,

58:54.040 --> 58:57.040
such that we can really live with,

58:57.040 --> 59:03.040
be along with how it shines in and withdraws,

59:03.040 --> 59:07.040
then we have the possibility of a fundamental reorientation

59:07.040 --> 59:10.040
and a new existential stance in the world,

59:10.040 --> 59:12.040
which is badly needed right now.

59:12.040 --> 59:16.040
Because all of the Cartesian things that we've gloried in,

59:16.040 --> 59:18.040
well, look at how much I can calculate

59:18.040 --> 59:20.040
and how I can paint and I can write poetry.

59:20.040 --> 59:24.040
That is all going to be challenged very soon.

59:29.040 --> 59:35.040
But this, this ability to enter into that axis-Mundi stance

59:35.040 --> 59:39.040
towards the ground of being that liberates me

59:41.040 --> 59:45.040
from the grasping so that I am in this deep,

59:45.040 --> 59:48.040
right, Ratio, Ratio religio,

59:48.040 --> 59:53.040
that is always available to you no matter what.

59:55.040 --> 01:00:01.040
You long for home because we are woven with

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.040
the nesting of the home range,

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:07.040
the home base, and the hearth,

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.040
with the fire logos at the center,

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.040
the hearth and hospital.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.040
We long for that.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040
We long for it.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040
But we're in a place where we need to recognize

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.040
what we are actually seeking.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:32.040
We're seeking to belong, to orient, and to transcend.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:36.040
And the right relationship with the ground of being

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:41.040
will give you those functions in a way that doesn't bind you

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.040
into that perpetual vacillation

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.040
between trying to find it retrospectively in the past,

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040
trying to find it prospectively in the future,

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:54.040
but finding the common law, the through line,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.040
that binds them all together.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.040
Thank you very much for your time and attention.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.040
Thank you, John.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.040
We're actually going to move quickly into our discussion.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.040
We have half an hour left before dinner.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.040
So just take two minutes, get a drink,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.040
use the washroom, and we'll get up, sit up.
