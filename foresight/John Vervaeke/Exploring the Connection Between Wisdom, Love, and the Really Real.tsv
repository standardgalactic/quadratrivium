0	14000	Welcome everyone to uh, I've really been looking forward to this voices with revaking I'm going to be talking with and I'm introducing you to Elizabeth O'Fields she had me on her show on the sacred and I had such a wonderful
15000	26000	Personally powerful interview and discussion with her she really drew me out in a powerful way we got into some very deep stuff and I was very moved by it and I've seen her on a couple other videos
26000	38000	Conversations very impressed I asked Elizabeth for two things to gifts to send me a copy of her book and to come back on my show and talk about it. The book we're going to be talking about is her wonderful book fully alive
39000	51000	Which is a very interesting it's very Augustinian it's a mix of a kind of autobiographical confession and psycho spiritual theological reflection and so I'm putting you there in some very August company
51000	64000	August company literally August company so yes and I'm going to introduce Elizabeth in a sec and let her tell her a little bit about herself and what I thought we do and I proposed Elizabeth is
64000	77000	I'm going to pick out some parts of her book that really sank to me really resonated either like they called to me deeply or they provoked a question in me and the intent is all say how
78000	91000	What it evoked or provoked in me share that with Elizabeth give her a chance to respond reflect and hopefully we'll get into a good flowing dialogue us and so that's the intent but first Elizabeth great welcome very much appreciate you coming
91000	104000	And why don't you just say a little bit about yourself we're going to get into some of you because your book is autobiographical but maybe just a little bit of framing you think might be helpful for some of my listeners who haven't met you before
104000	130000	Gosh how does one describe themselves well I am speaking to you from a very small and I've realized right in this book that the phrase intentional community is more jargon than I realized that it is that doesn't actually make a lot of sense to everybody so I'm using the phrase micro monastery a small community of families that live together and drawing on monastic rhythms in South London in the UK and
130000	141000	I think the thread of my life has been being really interested in these questions of what is a good life how do we live together well how do we learn to love each other more.
142000	147000	And what are the stories that culture is telling us that make that easier easier or harder.
148000	157000	And theological questions have been woven through that I've been in and out of faith and in all different kind of flavors and but those are my those are my.
158000	169000	Abiding questions what does it mean to really live what does it mean to grow in love what does it mean to connect with each other and have all done all kinds of jobs related to that but that's the kind of underground river.
170000	180000	Well thank you that's very very helpful so I guess as I said I want to just pick up on a few things and I want to pick up on.
181000	196000	I guess the first thing and that really struck me is and I found kind of a simpatico between us is you you say at one point so many people I speak to and I think it you mean when you were writing or when you were doing your show.
197000	213000	So many people I speak to create places to belong and ways to settle their soul and I thought wow that's because for me how that resonated with me is the sense of belonging the sense of connectedness meaning in life relevance realization I do a lot of work on that.
213000	227000	And then also this idea of you know getting the various elements of the psyche levels kinds of knowing a line is very platonic right inner justice outer connections reality and they're reinforcing each other so that's what landed with me.
228000	235000	And I wonder how what I just said lands with you is that was that something you were noticing in general that people are seeking.
235000	246000	I mean Plato proposed that there is the sort of two metadrives we want this kind of inner fullness piece and we want this fullness of contact and not just an intellectual we want to belong in some way.
247000	250000	What do you think what what what comes up for you when I say that.
250000	264000	Yes that's beautiful my knowledge of philosophy is patchy at best and so the main thing is allowing to learn more and to understand the different the ways different wisdom traditions use language.
265000	276000	That often feel like they're trying to get to something similar right something unspeakable something beyond language but certainly the the thread that I've been pulling on is what does it mean.
276000	281000	I used the phrase to someone recently and honestly as soon as I said it was like oh that sounds so smug.
282000	292000	But that we were talking about psychedelics and the psychedelics renaissance and what that might mean and the way it's changing the spiritual landscape and she said have you have you ever been tempted and I said well sure in a like curious way.
293000	302000	But I don't feel a need because I have a deep sense of existential satisfaction and then I was like that's like check your existential satisfaction privilege.
302000	305000	That's true like I need to be honest about that.
306000	309000	And I wonder if that like internal coherence.
310000	320000	That you use this lovely thing about different parts of our psyche lining up that actually the very deepest part of ourselves are very I sometimes think of them as our very deepest values the things we want to define our lives.
321000	323000	We are conscious of them for one thing.
324000	336000	And then we are making choices around them we are seeking to stay loyal to them rather than just sitting there thinking actually I'm not living the life I wanted to I'm not staying I'm not paying attention to myself I'm not staying loyal to my values.
338000	342000	And I'd love to I'd love to hear more I'm really interested in the way most wisdom traditions seem to.
343000	357000	Have reached for language to indicate that there are different parts of us right you might think of the ego and the it's super ego my tradition it's the flesh and the spirit of the you know there's actually broken up in different ways and different parts of scripture and different parts of my tradition.
358000	362000	Is that what Plato is grasping towards do you think there.
362000	387000	Well there's there's there's two different I mean because Plato there isn't one Plato just like there's not one voice in the Bible right so one of the great mistakes that was predominant in academic philosophy philosophy and research on Plato with for a long time that has now been pretty much overturned was this idea that there's a single voice of Plato and we can get a single
387000	401000	theory theory out of that single voice and we've largely come to realize no that's not how his philosophy works but to to them are and this one really prefigures Freud in major ways there's sort of three centers in us.
402000	415000	There's one you could call he calls it a monster that's sort of in your abdomen in your genitalia and it works in terms of super salient very present it's in the present moment super salient it's very urgent it works in terms of.
416000	417000	Appetites and drives.
418000	430000	Yeah yes and then you have this thing that's there's no real good translation for it I'm sort of touching my heart area but when I say heart all kinds of romanticism rolls in that's not important or relevant or even important.
430000	431000	So I'm going to the Greek word.
432000	449000	It's kind of where our sociocultural emotions are how we want to be connected to other people recognized and values by others is where we have things like pride and shame and admiration and envy that so it's working at this sort of social connectedness level.
450000	469000	And then there's this and he represents that with a lion lion hearted and where we get you know courage and lions are social animals and then forgive the sexism but compared to a lot of people played it was you know very far ahead he actually said women could be philosophers they could be in the army they could be governed they could be rulers of the state.
470000	482000	Right but there's a man in your head and they that man can pursue long term abstract goals and they work in terms of true he works in terms of truth and falsity and then he talks about.
483000	493000	Right so they're working at these different scales and they have different goals and his point which is I think very well I think he develops better than Freud in some ways because he talks about the cognitive dimensions of these things.
494000	502000	Is that each one of these has got pretty good sort of psychological cognitive scientific evidence for it that we have these different kinds of motivations.
503000	515000	And then his point is they often come in conflict with each other because they're working according to different criteria and at different scales and then what part of it is to be wise.
516000	536000	Is to figure out the optimal relation each one seeks to be maximal but the degree to which it's maximal it damages the other two right and so you have to get a way of getting them all working as optimally together and that's a fullness of life because then everything is being as fully as live to use your phrase as possibly can.
537000	544000	And if you give me one more minute and then the idea is that inner conflict is the driver and this is where it overlaps with Freud of a lot of.
545000	559000	Our self deception of a lot of our projection our defensiveness our neurosis and right and as we ameliorate that inner conflict we start to cleanse the doors of perception and see more deeply into reality.
560000	568000	As we see more deeply into reality we get better at seeing more deeply into reality and then we can more better realize the real patterns of the psyche.
568000	578000	We can align the psyche better we can then see more deeply into reality and this is the ascent out of the cave this rolling reciprocal opening that's going on.
579000	584000	That's the and Plato's idea is that is the way to mutually satisfy our two meta drives.
585000	594000	Our two meta drives are in addition to whatever satisfies our desire we want the satisfaction of our desire to not create inner conflict and undermine our agency.
594000	596000	We want it to lead to a piece of fullness.
597000	604000	And in addition to whatever satisfies our desires we want what satisfies our desires to be real not fake not an illusion not a fraud.
604000	610000	And when we can mix though when we get those two together we get that sense of inner peace and connectedness to what's most real.
611000	613000	And that's his proposal for human happiness.
614000	615000	Thank you.
615000	617000	I'm going to go away and chew on it.
617000	620000	Sorry I didn't know I didn't want to get it.
620000	622000	No it's really helpful because it.
624000	628000	The the sort of working thesis I have about sin and again this is pretty personal.
628000	635000	Just ponderings allowed rather rather than and well he and in the book I'm not claiming a kind of.
636000	637000	Closed thesis or.
639000	650000	You know one of the things I had to liberate myself actually from in order to be able to write was this desire that in a thing you say in this deep area you have to be completely certain of and you need to approach in this very academic fashion and liberate
650000	658000	liberating myself honestly to sort of in play to his language to draw on wisdom from all of those right and to say particularly this bit for me.
659000	661000	Connection is everything fully alive.
661000	675000	This is everything relationship is everything and it's not that he's completely abandoned you know reason or the man in our head or or or whatever but that the primacy of that post enlightenment post reformation the way.
676000	677000	The way we have.
678000	681000	Disconnected we have made wisdom subsumed under knowledge.
682000	688000	And scripture is my scriptures are incredibly clear that wisdom is not the same thing as knowledge that you can learn a bunch of facts.
689000	690000	And it puffs you up.
691000	694000	Wisdom builds you and other people up.
695000	703000	And so my kind of getting to the point of thinking what do what do I think is getting in the way of my fully aliveness and the fully aliveness in the world.
704000	708000	Why do we do what we do not want to do and not do what we do not want what we do want to do.
709000	710000	Why can we not tackle the climate crisis.
711000	712000	Why do we not seem to be able to live together well.
713000	716000	Why is tribalism polarization exploding.
717000	718000	What is it about humans.
718000	719000	Right.
720000	724000	Given we are so beautiful and so tender and have so much potential for glory and goodness.
726000	727000	What are we doing.
728000	737000	And that deep sense of actually the tradition that was in the background in my childhood and that I had rejected once that says that's a sin that this is what's tripping us up.
738000	739000	And I was like sin.
740000	741000	Yeah.
742000	743000	It's unfashionable.
744000	745000	Well I don't care.
745000	747000	I think you're saying something really important.
748000	751000	First of all I agree wholeheartedly with the distinction between knowledge and wisdom.
752000	754000	Knowledge is about overcoming ignorance.
755000	757000	Wisdom is over about overcoming foolishness and those are different things.
758000	759000	Ignorance is a lack of knowledge.
760000	765000	Foolishness is a failure to grasp the proper significance of what you know and apply it appropriately.
766000	767000	Live it.
768000	769000	Yes exactly.
770000	773000	And that's when talking about different kinds of knowing and getting them aligned could be important.
773000	775000	But let's not get into that right now.
778000	779000	I see.
780000	784000	So I once proposed this definition and I was trying to create a bridge and I don't know.
785000	788000	I don't think it succeeded because I don't think anybody got it or they didn't seem to pick up on it.
789000	790000	So I'm going to try again.
791000	792000	Sorry.
793000	799000	I was trying to bridge between the theological language and this philosophical language around foolishness where foolishness isn't just you do this thing.
799000	803000	No it's more like this system of self deception that takes on a life of its own.
804000	807000	And one of the papers I published with Leo Ferraro we called it parasitic processing.
808000	814000	It's this kind of thing that takes you over and narrows you down and narrows you and flattens your world and you get sort of locked in.
815000	818000	Very much like the machinery that my friend Mark Lewis talks about with addiction.
819000	826000	You know your cognitive flexibility and your sense of who you could be diminishes and the world shrinks and they reciprocally narrow which is the opposite.
826000	832000	And here's the connection with love because love is reciprocally opening right.
833000	841000	And so I said I think and so if you can get to this notion of foolishness is kind of anti love.
842000	846000	I said I wonder if we could understand sin as a failure to love wisely.
847000	855000	I wonder what you think of that as a proposal as I know it's very Augustinian but if you object I'm happy to hear but what do you think about that.
857000	866000	I in my current working ponderings love and sin are opposites.
867000	878000	And so for me fully alive this is connection is moving towards life moving towards our own soul moving towards each other moving towards the earth actually and moving towards the divine.
879000	880000	Yes.
880000	885000	And it's the withdrawal and the disconnection that is the sort of blanket category for sin.
886000	889000	Luther and Augustin use this phrase homo incanvatis in say I don't know.
890000	891000	No one knows how you pronounce that.
892000	899000	Man or humanity turned in on ourselves and the sense of an in growing toenail.
899000	909000	And so the idea that love that sin is love not applied wisely or foolishly.
910000	915000	I'd have to sit with that a little bit I think it for me for me.
916000	922000	I haven't given much thought to foolishness but what you're making me think about foolishness is it's a real category in the book of Proverbs spoken about a lot.
923000	925000	The wise man and the foolish man and the wife man and the foolish man and some of that.
926000	927000	Jesus does too.
927000	928000	Yeah.
929000	940000	And I guess for me the sort of outworkings of what I've been grasping towards is that foolishness is a failure to understand that life is connection.
941000	951000	That love is what draws us that love is what defines us and pride as the sort of kings in is the idea that we can manage without it.
951000	959000	That we can manage without other people that we are not relational that we're not interconnected that actually we are the solipsistic autonomous self actualizing self creating.
960000	963000	So maybe there is some overlap because that's a withdrawal from love.
964000	965000	I think so.
966000	970000	What I heard when you were doing the in grown toenail is very much what.
971000	980000	First of all let's get the idea that the self is not a monad that the self is not an Aristotelian substance independently existing possessing its properties and being the sole author of its business.
981000	984000	Let's go to 40 cogs and say the self is inherently dialogical.
985000	986000	It's inherently relational.
987000	991000	And then that inward turning is what we were trying to get at with this notion of reciprocal narrowing.
992000	993000	Right.
994000	1001000	Where I I'm I'm not I'm less and less tapping into the depth of myself and less and less opening tapping into the depth of the other.
1002000	1005000	And that seems to mean like the hardening of the heart.
1005000	1006000	Yes.
1007000	1008000	Yeah.
1009000	1010000	Right.
1011000	1015000	And to me I was I was trying to get at the idea that when we're not loving wisely we're we have chosen to go into reciprocal narrowing and harden our heart.
1016000	1025000	And the heart is what we're behind as we engage in the bullshit pretense of being autonomous substances completely self making and self interpreting.
1026000	1028000	That that was what I was trying to get at.
1028000	1029000	Yes.
1029000	1030000	Yeah.
1030000	1031000	I think that's brilliant.
1031000	1035000	I love that language of of patterns because I'm obsessed with formation.
1035000	1052000	This this you know the this interconnects with the way McGill Chris work about attention and the and I was the the hardening the heart thing came up for me because I was talking to someone about what is going on with these people having very spiritual experience on psychedelics and what is the role of attention and what is it.
1052000	1054000	That means that I feel.
1055000	1065000	Able to have what certainly seemed to be experiences of the divine in a ways that people with a different temperament formation history than we find would long for but find really difficult.
1066000	1067000	Yes.
1067000	1068000	Yes.
1068000	1069000	And whether these types of attention.
1071000	1078000	Can yeah that they shape what we can see right they shape what's possible for us they should and that that that what did you call it reciprocal narrowing.
1079000	1080000	The reciprocal opening.
1080000	1081000	Yeah.
1081000	1082000	Yeah.
1082000	1091000	And that when we've tried when we try and live in ways practices and rituals and themes and communities crucially communities that mean that our formation is towards love.
1091000	1097000	We will increasingly open to the world and open to reality and open to each other.
1097000	1099000	And now I want to read that paper.
1100000	1101000	Okay.
1101000	1102000	Thank you.
1102000	1103000	Thank you.
1103000	1110000	So so that notion of connectedness I mean this is what I do a lot of my actual scientific work on.
1110000	1125000	So the core of one of my central theses is that general intelligence the kind of intelligence we demonstrate and the kind that they're trying to make with artificial general intelligence at the core of it is this ability.
1125000	1134000	There's two things interlocked anticipation the more you can sort of anticipate the future the more intelligent we the more intelligence we attribute an organism.
1134000	1144000	But interlock with that is Mike the core problem which is relevance realization there's so much there's so much information available it's astronaut astronomically vast.
1144000	1152000	There's so much information in your memory and all the ways you could combine it there's so many different sequences of behavior sounds you could utter.
1152000	1160000	There's so many logical possibilities you could consider and the thing that you do and this is kind of like the Zen Cohen is your intelligent by ignoring almost all of that information.
1160000	1170000	But you don't ignore it randomly because if you ignore it randomly you to have an astronomical chance of doing the wrong thing somehow you zero in on the relevant information.
1170000	1181000	And here's the thing relevance isn't in me and relevance isn't in the object it's how the object and I are fitted together how we belong together for a certain task.
1181000	1192000	And it's not cold calculation because it's what's grabbing my attention it's what's arousing my affect it's what's committing my agency and so it's always bound up with care.
1192000	1208000	So relevance realization is this is this homing and notice the word I'm using homing in on something a deep connectedness a deep caring a deep evolving involvement and I use the I use the Latin word religio to talk about that sense of connectedness.
1208000	1221000	And then that's the first thesis and I won't give you all the arguments and evidence for that I've been doing that for like, I don't know, 25 years making that argument, tons of publications and other people publishing on that and all that so I'm just going to take that.
1221000	1232000	And so, I think that's the core of our agency as intelligent beings, and I think it also plays a significant role in consciousness, we could get back to that if you wish.
1232000	1238000	But then here's the second proposal that that religio that sense of connectedness.
1238000	1246000	So that's coming out of the part of psychology that studying intelligence one of the problems in psychology is the different parts don't talk to each other. That's why I'm a cognitive scientist.
1246000	1253000	And then you have two other streams. You have people doing meaning in life and people doing the psychology of belonging like Kelly Allen.
1253000	1269000	Here's my proposal that what the psychologists are talking about and measuring when they're measuring meaning in life is they're measuring that that how much people have a celebrated sense of religio of connectedness that is deeply relevant to them and affords them
1269000	1285000	solving problems and in and using your language forming their identity and their agency. And that's also what people are talking about in that sense of belonging in the belonging literature and then if you don't have a sense of belonging, you're in trouble psychologically
1286000	1298000	social socially, even physiologically. And I think all three of these converge on this sense of religio and that sense of connectedness.
1298000	1308000	And the way you can sort of test for meaning in life. I think you and I might have talked about this is you can ask people three questions. What do they want to exist even if they don't.
1308000	1324000	How real is it and how much of a difference do they make to it right now. The more answers you have to those questions and the deeper you think your answers are, the more I will predict you say your life has meaning in life.
1325000	1342000	What do you think about that is trying to unpack this, because you do you and wonderfully so you keep coming back this sense of connectedness, this movement towards an opening up to but also letting other letting the world and letting other people into one
1342000	1360000	like this seems to me to be exactly what you're talking about. And this scientific literature would plug into that. I think I mean it just it makes so much sense to me on such a deep level and it is essentially what I think most of theology is about which makes sense.
1360000	1368000	If you believe that we are made in the image of a God who is relationship in and of God self right if you believe in the Trinity.
1368000	1388000	Oh, I want to talk to you about that. We're going to talk about that. That's great. I think the other the other real thread that I pull on a lot is Martin Buber and I thou and the phrase that he uses about when we see and I say two thirds of I thou the very short
1388000	1394000	is about moments between us and other people and the last third is about moments between us and the divine us and God, but it.
1395000	1414000	He says the moments of religio you could I think replace me when we turn and other people stop to stop being objects to us or symbols or ciphers or just collections of pre like pattern recognition predictions what we already know about them, you know we put out into the world and we don't really need to take the cognitive
1414000	1423000	time to we just people do what you expect them to do the moments we cut through that and we really see them and we see them as a you and we were taking a new information we were seeing them.
1423000	1425000	That is all that is really real.
1426000	1440000	That is that that is living that is life that is fully aliveness that is that's it that's that's everything that's the game and he and another book of his he writes about how we spend a huge amount of time in different disciplines thinking about the individual self which
1440000	1451000	neither you or I really believe in but you know on all different disciplines health and psychology and sociology and politics and then we spend a lot of time thinking about ourselves as groups as like.
1452000	1461000	You know sociology how do groups work how do they integrate how do we define but there's a third category which is the between yes exactly the between.
1462000	1468000	The between the religio and this we don't it's so hard to it's so intangible it's so difficult to talk about.
1468000	1476000	And so the idea I didn't know that I didn't know your thesis on this I know there was a whole scientific way attempt I know that there's someone being done in philosophy on it but.
1477000	1486000	Yeah, I that that awareness that the thing that's hard to talk about might be the really real like might be the ball game is very exciting to me.
1486000	1490000	So and this is a this is an idea from what's called for ecog sigh.
1492000	1501000	But I've coined a term I talk about the religio as neither subjective nor objective but transjective it's exactly the between don't know what that means.
1501000	1515000	Well what it's a new term what it means is it's it's it's beyond in between the subjective and objective it's what binds the subjective and objective together so that meaning and truth are possible because neither subjectivity or objectivity will give you meaning nor truth.
1516000	1525000	Because meaning or truth are inherently relational in nature and then you combine together meaning religio and truth in a powerful way.
1525000	1528000	Let me let me let me show you what what you're talking about.
1528000	1537000	So I want to take the I want to take the boober and I agree with you I thou I think is a very central book talked quite a bit in other places about boober.
1538000	1555000	But I want to I want to then shift to a murdoch example that John Wright talks about murdoch talks about the mother in law who has his daughter in law that she regards is really kind of course and you know and rude and a little bit disorganized.
1556000	1563000	And then one day she has this realization and notice the word I just used she has this realization that wait.
1563000	1574000	Maybe her daughter is spontaneous and rounded and really authentic and maybe she's been understanding you know things these phenomena in exactly the wrong way.
1574000	1579000	So notice she's she's getting an insight that's going in both directions and here's that opening.
1579000	1585000	She's getting an insight into who this person might be beyond all of her pattern predictions.
1585000	1596000	But she's also realizing that her way of framing it that way of doing this was also problematic and she needs to unlock the two together.
1596000	1608000	And Wright calls that sensibility transcendence and what I'm trying to get you to note is what's happening there is this reciprocal opening of the relevance realization machinery.
1608000	1620000	It's like it's an insight it's like oh I was treating the wrong I was treating that I was seeing this in the wrong way was considering the wrong things I was ignoring the wrong things and the way I was framing it the way I was homing in on it was wrong.
1620000	1630000	I have to open both up together and we get a sense like you said and this and then I want to drill down on another one of your quotes.
1630000	1638000	We get a sense of the really real and that's why I want to pause because you said that right and we use realization.
1638000	1643000	And it's this betweenness and that's the really real and I want to talk about your.
1643000	1659000	First is that fair conversion I don't know what language is not offensive but you talk about I believe you're at a camp or something and you talk about it and you let me try and see if I can quickly find the actual quote because I thought it was really wonderful.
1660000	1674000	You talk about having an ecstatic experience you quote Murdoch and the unselfing that I was just referring to so that's and you talk about it as terms of.
1674000	1681000	Here, my question had been answered with an overwhelming felt presence.
1682000	1693000	An encounter with a you which you put in scare quotes which means don't use that word we the way we typically use it defined by love and acceptance and peace.
1693000	1704000	And you also go on to talk about my life had acquired another dimension so reality is opening up this is a real real for you it's a realization it's a transformative realization.
1704000	1715000	And it's the sense of a felt presence that right is something like but not the same as what we are normally capturing by you.
1715000	1725000	And this is wonderful and I want you to unpack that a little bit more if you can and I know and we're both smiling and I appreciate your smile.
1725000	1733000	I'm not expecting you to you know to be Thomas Aquinas here or anything like that nor am I expecting that I would be that.
1733000	1740000	But what I want is I just want to play with you about this like real serious good faith play around.
1740000	1749000	These things are all coming together the sense of the really real the betweenness the loveless the love the connectedness presence.
1749000	1756000	And you're not talking about like you're not talking about you know the presence of the terminate thing.
1756000	1762000	I think Boober is very clear about that right and you want to you want to say this is in the second person.
1762000	1772000	It's not the first person subjective it's not the third person objective it's the second person right transjective if you'll allow me my neologism and you're playing with all of this.
1772000	1785000	And I think this is all resonant with what we've talked about so far but can just more say more like can go back on that because like that is so.
1785000	1794000	Like this because I and later on when you're talking about God you talk about God more adverbial you talk about God as a way of paying attention.
1794000	1802000	Right which is really really interesting much more relational much more adverbial rather than the properties of a thing.
1802000	1811000	It's a way in which there's a presence presencing if I can put it that way that seemed to be fair to how you're talking.
1812000	1818000	And the reason so part of this is selfish on my part part of it I'm doing a lot of work on this there's a book out.
1818000	1828000	Oh I can't remember it called Presence right now on some of the COGS I about sense a felt sense of presence and we can sort of induce a little bit of it in the labs.
1828000	1836000	Which doesn't mean it's an illusion because we can make you see a car when there's no car and that doesn't mean cars are illusion right that's a bad argument.
1836000	1843000	But right so I'm part of me is the selfish scientist I really wanted you know somebody like you give me some data.
1843000	1850000	Well give me some data but but but but but I promise you I'm not going to just I'm going to really listen also as a you.
1850000	1861000	Right I'm going to listen because I care about this also as a person because I think right think about it wisdom is about this loving enhancement of our connectedness of our ability.
1861000	1872000	The wise person can go into a complex messy ill-defined situation and home in on what's relevant some in their agency in the right way so that they are properly responsible.
1872000	1878000	And so there's a connection between the realization of this and the ability to be wise.
1878000	1882000	Sorry I'm talking too much because I'm enthusiastic I'm going to shut up and open a space for you.
1883000	1884000	Thank you.
1884000	1895000	No it is a very it's a tender and powerful invitation and as you know sort of when I approach with fear and trembling and the book where the bit in the book we're trying to address it directly is.
1895000	1904000	It's like four paragraphs of explaining why this is hard.
1905000	1907000	Yeah so.
1907000	1913000	What we're talking about in the source my most simple and familiar language is God is.
1913000	1919000	Which I sometimes use the cinnamon of love for with a capital L.
1919000	1926000	And that experience.
1926000	1934000	Even though I've written about in the book someone's I'm currently trying to write about it again for someone who is fascinated by an essay for them and that they're like.
1934000	1941000	I know you say words can't get at it but will you try like will you will you go more will you go deeper and so I'm really reaching for I want to help you.
1941000	1942000	The edges.
1942000	1943000	Yeah.
1943000	1947000	Yeah the edges of language with it and the things that.
1947000	1949000	The things that.
1949000	1953000	The things that come up for me.
1953000	1957000	Are just the undeniability of.
1957000	1963000	That moment of encounter and how.
1963000	1966000	How about how impossible it is because.
1966000	1972000	Honestly like I can close my eyes now and.
1972000	1975000	Know my know myself.
1975000	1980000	Seen and.
1980000	1983000	The.
1983000	1989000	The deep the deep knowing of present of the presence of love in my life.
1989000	1999000	And the way that every other moment of love and encounter and intimacy and reflection reflects that is.
1999000	2002000	Is the ground is the ground of my being you know in Kierkegaard's.
2002000	2007000	Understanding of it and.
2007000	2010000	In that moment it was really like.
2010000	2017000	Night and day it was people have been theorizing theorizing about God around me and I've been a bit interested and.
2017000	2028000	Questioning and been like maybe I believe maybe I don't believe asking loads of hard questions of this youth group that I randomly ended up in through a friend and then at this festival that I randomly ended up in because of fancy some of the boys.
2029000	2038000	Not from a particularly Christian family at all like it wasn't a big deal in my childhood I didn't have it shaping my imaginative world as a child in a way that.
2038000	2042000	Lots of people did for good or ill.
2042000	2046000	I know that was complex for you but it.
2046000	2055000	It went from a theory to reality in that moment I asked a direct question and received a direct answer and.
2055000	2062000	You know the other thing that gets close to it and I quote is Pascal's what's known as the night of fire when he says.
2062000	2066000	Not the God of the philosophers or the scholars.
2066000	2074000	The are attempts to tame and theorize and analyze just get like.
2074000	2076000	And you're left with.
2076000	2080000	He says fire fire fire joy joy joy.
2080000	2082000	You know.
2082000	2086000	And as I've gone back to it and it feels.
2086000	2094000	Feel there's a chapter in the book on sex and writing about sex felt less intimate and vulnerable than trying to write about the moment yes.
2094000	2100000	Because it feels so holy and personal but.
2100000	2105000	What I've been thinking about it is when I first when I when I had my babies.
2105000	2113000	When I met my babies for the first time and it was this weird mix of surprise and deep recognition.
2113000	2117000	Surprise and recognition excellent that's that's.
2117000	2120000	Like hello of course it's you.
2120000	2123000	Also who are you.
2123000	2126000	I know you I don't know you.
2126000	2127000	Who are you.
2127000	2130000	You're so here.
2130000	2133000	And.
2133000	2135000	Honestly that's that.
2135000	2138000	I want to make sure I'm getting the connection sorry for interrupting.
2138000	2141000	Please do that that that moment of.
2141000	2144000	Let's call it like encounter.
2144000	2152000	It's almost like platonic and amnesis you remembered something you didn't know you had in you like Plato talks about this weird kind of remembering.
2152000	2158000	Where like when we're doing when we're doing the dialogical practices with people they'll often say I discovered a form of intimacy.
2158000	2163000	That I did not know about but I've always been looking for that kind of weird.
2163000	2164000	Yeah.
2164000	2165000	Okay.
2165000	2166000	Okay.
2166000	2167000	So that's landing.
2167000	2168000	Good.
2168000	2169000	So.
2169000	2175000	And are you saying that that obviously also you're experiencing a particular kind of love you're pro you're experiencing the prototypical instance of agape.
2175000	2178000	You're not loving this person because you want to consume them.
2178000	2179000	They're consumable.
2179000	2183000	You're not loving them because they're a great friend and you've had a life together.
2183000	2186000	You're loving them because you're caught up in the process of.
2186000	2198000	You know there's a possible there's a person that I'm going to participate in them in the creation of which is like analogous to God creating persons something like that the Bible uses that metaphor.
2198000	2215000	And am I understanding you correctly you're using and saying that that intimate remembering of and surprise when I encountered my my babies is a close analogy to that sense of God.
2215000	2219000	Am I am I I'm trying to get the make sure I'm not connecting it inappropriately.
2219000	2226000	I mean the thing about this is everything every time I go okay it's like this I'm like yes but it's also not like it is.
2226000	2232000	Yeah of course of course of course it's all these.
2232000	2239000	It is literally a space beyond language and so the poet poetry gets closest.
2239000	2255000	Music gets closest like and it really helped me I was reading I think Mike McHarg was and this might be one of those bullshit studies so forgive me I did not go check my references or look at the you know look at the rigorous rigorous.
2255000	2270000	That's how seriously I've been here but in some ways it's a metaphor but he was saying when when when researchers are trying to do fmi scanning on people in in sort of deep ecstatic states or deep prayer deep contemplative prayer particularly nuns that
2270000	2272000	have prayed prayed for a long long long time.
2272000	2281000	The other type ecstatic states like akin to the kind of ones that I have the language center of the brain is just quiet.
2281000	2288000	Yep nothing is in the default mode network goes down to right which is your sense of self which is why you get that unselfing experience.
2288000	2292000	Interesting that that is fairly good evidence by the way it has it's it's not bad.
2292000	2300000	Great wouldn't want to be quite a bunch of science but it really helped me because I'm a writer right this is my thing.
2300000	2303000	I love words.
2303000	2323000	The not the feeling like my sentences would like ricocheting off this memory and and that was something almost dishonorable about attempting to capture it.
2323000	2331000	I both want to because I so want I so want to share this yeah it's the treasure.
2331000	2344000	But also it is so personal and it's where I saw I don't believe in individuals but I do believe in persons and I do believe in human particularity and who knows what the soul is but it's the closest language I've got for.
2344000	2354000	The particular me that has connection with religio was encounter with either with divine love.
2354000	2359000	And that you can't it has to be particular it has to be personal.
2359000	2362000	To be the really real.
2362000	2365000	I think that's right I want to pick up.
2365000	2371000	But first of all, you I want you I think you know this you're safe here to talk to me.
2371000	2372000	I'm not out.
2372000	2373000	I'm not gunning for anything.
2373000	2375000	I know I do feel that.
2375000	2376000	Okay, good.
2376000	2377000	Good.
2377000	2378000	Thank you.
2378000	2382000	Secondly, I've had several of these kinds of experiences in my life.
2382000	2392000	And I also have practices that are designed and succeed in bringing me into a more reliable conformity to that realization of the really real.
2392000	2398000	So this is something I think we deeply share.
2399000	2408000	I think there's so there's a couple of things that are very one is this Agape and the great, you know, the great statement in the epistle of John, right?
2408000	2409000	God is Agape.
2409000	2414000	It's this got the this is an identity claim which we don't get very many of the Bible.
2414000	2419000	And the identity claims there's basically for and they're all inherently relational.
2419000	2421000	God is love Agape club.
2421000	2423000	God is light, which is also relational.
2423000	2424000	You don't see light.
2424000	2428000	You see by means of light and the way it creates relations of intelligibility between things.
2428000	2436000	God is the logos and logos doesn't mean just word and we've tend to reduce logos to logic.
2436000	2442000	But logos means this what you're trying to get at this ground of intelligibility.
2442000	2443000	Right.
2443000	2444000	And of course, God is also life.
2444000	2445000	Right.
2445000	2446000	And it's right.
2446000	2450000	And life is inherently relational too.
2450000	2452000	And I wanted to I wanted to I wanted to.
2452000	2454000	So we've got this right.
2454000	2459000	And yeah, I think persons are inherently relational things rather than substantial things.
2459000	2462000	And there's something particular about them.
2462000	2464000	The Buddhists have this term suchness.
2464000	2466000	Everything actually has its suchness in some ways.
2466000	2468000	It's absolute.
2468000	2479000	Like because anything, any words I use to talk about this is our categorical and they don't pick up on the suchness of this, the way it's not the way it's different from every all the other things in the category.
2480000	2489000	And then there's also a moreness that that suchness is somehow non logically identical with all of the relations and connections that it bears.
2489000	2493000	And I think persons are a particular kind of nexus there.
2493000	2499000	And I wonder if that you find that language helpful.
2500000	2504000	This surprise and recognition.
2504000	2506000	I like Plato talks about this a lot.
2506000	2509000	This is how we this is how we recognize the forms.
2509000	2510000	We go.
2510000	2512000	Oh, but and then we go.
2512000	2513000	Oh, but of course, right?
2513000	2522000	It's that it's that it's that simultaneous like in and it's like and beauty is that combination is why beauty is so important to play.
2522000	2524000	Beauty is a combination of surprise.
2524000	2527000	But yet, right, of course.
2527000	2528000	Yes.
2528000	2530000	I didn't I see it that way before.
2530000	2531000	Yeah, exactly.
2531000	2532000	Exactly.
2532000	2540000	And so that is all background and I'm not I didn't try to thread it as a premise by premise argument.
2540000	2542000	I was just laying it out as okay.
2542000	2544000	Yeah.
2544000	2556000	Because this is the thing that and I mentioned logos and light because they bring out that yes, we don't see the light and there's nothing in terms of which we can understand the logos.
2556000	2560000	The Neoplatonists talk about the one is that by which you understand everything, but it's nothing.
2560000	2573000	You can't conceive of the one because you can't put it outside of it of it in order to conceive of it as an object because it permeate that you keep trying to step out and looking and it's already behind you.
2573000	2574000	Right.
2574000	2575000	Yeah.
2575000	2576000	Right.
2576000	2578000	Making it possible for you to live and move and have a being in.
2578000	2579000	Exactly.
2579000	2580000	Exactly.
2580000	2582000	But here's the thing.
2582000	2584000	And I get the reverence.
2584000	2585000	Right.
2585000	2591000	The deep care because the importance notice the heightening of a legio, the deep care and the importance of this.
2591000	2594000	And so I'm not trying to trespass on your reverence.
2594000	2595000	But the question is like this.
2595000	2609000	The thing that I'm driving at is maybe it's even asked its quest maybe is, but it doesn't mean that there is any disconnect from all of that intelligibility and that ground of intelligibility.
2609000	2615000	The fact that the words don't capture it doesn't mean that there is this gap or space.
2615000	2619000	In fact, it, it reaches into the words.
2619000	2620000	It permeates them.
2620000	2621000	It grounds them.
2621000	2622000	Right.
2622000	2625000	And it's, it's, it's, it's loving in that sense.
2625000	2626000	It embraces them.
2626000	2627000	It affords them.
2627000	2628000	It makes them possible.
2628000	2632000	It is the inexhaustible fount of flowing intelligibility.
2632000	2636000	And so, and it's, and the reason why I get like that, it's that connection.
2636000	2641000	That's why we have the weirdness of the connection, I think, because the surprise is I can't capture it.
2641000	2651000	But the, of course is, ah, but it's intimately interwoven with all of my sense making, all of the light of my world, all of the logos of my world.
2651000	2656000	And for me, that's what I'm trying to, and you can see now I'm doing the same thing.
2656000	2657000	I'm struggling.
2657000	2659000	I'm doing things with my, my hands.
2659000	2660000	Yeah.
2660000	2661000	Exactly.
2661000	2667000	But did that, I'm trying to take a baby step here, but does that land for you what I was trying to get at?
2667000	2686000	Because part of the, part of what I want to challenge and push against is people who think what we're doing is a kind of a kind, I don't know, something like a mystification, a kind of fundamental right otherness.
2686000	2694000	It is, but it's, and you quote Williams about this, but it's, but it's also, as he points, it's anotherness that somehow embraces us, right?
2694000	2698000	And isn't even competing with us, not one, not one Iota.
2698000	2707000	I'm trying to get at, I'm trying to get that the surprise and the recognition are sort of the two sides of this, right?
2707000	2715000	The ineffable, but that is also nevertheless sourcing all of our intelligibility.
2715000	2719000	Sorry, that was a lot, but that's, I want, my question is, does that resonate with you?
2719000	2723000	Does that sing true to how your experiences are?
2723000	2724000	I think so.
2724000	2744000	I'm not sure if I've understood you, but I, the things that's making me think about are how the, that experience and the experiences that I have now felt like the cultural scripts around them were irrational.
2744000	2745000	Right.
2745000	2757000	That they were sort of, yeah, that my identity, you know, I worked at the BBC for five years.
2757000	2760000	I want to run a think tank in Westminster.
2760000	2762000	I have two degrees.
2762000	2763000	You know, I'm a feminist.
2763000	2767000	I'm sort of sickeningly metropolitan intelligentsia, at least in this aspiration.
2767000	2769000	I read the New Yorker.
2769000	2770000	Right.
2770000	2776000	And so that seriously is disgusting.
2776000	2787000	Self-making of my formation, you know, smart girl at school, jump the academic hoops.
2787000	2789000	And honestly, when I was young, there was like two parts.
2789000	2791000	You're going to be the hot girl or the smart girl.
2791000	2793000	I'm going to be the smart girl.
2793000	2794000	That's who I am.
2794000	2795000	That's surprising.
2795000	2797000	You're quite a beautiful woman.
2797000	2798000	Thank you.
2798000	2799000	Okay.
2799000	2801000	Teenagers, teenagers, you know, weird.
2801000	2802000	Okay.
2802000	2813000	But it, when, when you're thinking about the self that we make from the messages we get from the culture around us, intelligent became one of my things I wanted people to perceive me as.
2813000	2823000	And it, it's very left homophoric, actually very male, disembodied.
2824000	2831000	Increasing these science leaning, not humanities leaning, you know, that kind of.
2831000	2832000	Okay.
2832000	2846000	In order to be respectable, in order to be impressive, in order to, to, to, to connect with the kind of people I'm interested in, in the world of ideas and the books, this bit of me that like lay flat on the floor weeping at the feet of Jesus when I was 15.
2846000	2848000	I couldn't hold those two things together.
2848000	2859000	And so it, it fell apart and the bit that the things that we can't talk about the emotional experiential encounter of the really real.
2859000	2867000	I didn't have categories for and no one around me had categories for and the kind of person I was wanting to be becoming required me to let it go.
2867000	2877000	And I think part of what the sort of quest I'm on is to push back against that and say.
2877000	2884000	And I think your work and McGill Chris work on a bunch of other people in the last five years to go.
2885000	2897000	Expand our understanding of what intelligence is, expand our understanding of how we access the real of what, how we perceive the world of what it might, what wisdom might mean.
2897000	2900000	And it, like, honestly, I'm full circle.
2900000	2904000	I'm back, I'm back, like, waving my praise flag, praying in tongues.
2904000	2908000	And a part of my brain is like, what are you doing?
2908000	2925000	And starts doing the like, you know, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the, all the theories, all the psychology, all the crowd dynamics, all the credulity, all the, my friends who take psychedelics have these experiences is just induced all these things like some of that's going on in my brain.
2926000	2936000	But this bit, you know, you talked about this, like, so the middle bit in the Plato thing, what I would call my soul is like, I need this.
2936000	2938000	Is it Pascal again?
2938000	2939000	I'm obsessed with Pascal.
2939000	2944000	Like, I would, Pascal would be my boyfriend if he was alive now.
2944000	2948000	He said, the heart has reasons, reason knows not.
2948000	2949000	Yeah.
2949000	2955000	And I'm like, and he talked about the difference between the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse, which prefigures Ian's work.
2955000	2961000	I was, I just saw in a couple of weeks ago, we were at a conference celebrating his work together.
2961000	2965000	And he and I have had several conversations together.
2965000	2970000	So, I think we share that project.
2970000	2976000	What, let me just say, for example, there's a paper.
2977000	2982000	First author by Johannes Yeager, but I'm also a co-author on it with some other people.
2982000	2984000	And we're in third round of revisions.
2984000	2986000	We had two reviewers and we went through all their edits.
2986000	2987000	We're ready to go.
2987000	2990000	And then the third reviewer out of other blue finally sends in the review.
2990000	2996000	We have to start the whole process over again, which is, yes, those are some of the yuckiness of the academic world.
2996000	2998000	But I'm very confident we're going to get it published.
2998000	3004000	And basically, and I presented this argument directly to Ian, like he was literally four feet away from me facing him.
3005000	3007000	And he liked it.
3007000	3010000	But it's around the fact that.
3010000	3014000	So logic is logic is an example of a formal system.
3014000	3016000	Math is an example of a formal system.
3016000	3018000	Like it's completely self-contained rule defining.
3018000	3020000	And there's Godelian problems with it.
3020000	3023000	And so remember that, but that's what a formal system is.
3023000	3025000	And the proposal is that's what the left hemisphere likes.
3025000	3033000	The left hemisphere likes to use formal systems to solve well-defined problems like math problems and logical problems in which you have a very good representation.
3034000	3035000	Of what matters.
3035000	3038000	It's all packaged for you there by the formal system.
3038000	3042000	Now here, and that would be the spirit of geometry in Pascal.
3042000	3054000	But the process of formalization of creating a formal system, which uses relevance realization is not itself something that can be done by a formal system.
3056000	3062000	The process that makes formal systems is not itself something done by a formal system.
3062000	3076000	It is done by something that is dealing with messy, ill-defined flowing problems that require this very careful trading off between complex dynamics in a flowing dynamic gestalt.
3076000	3080000	And that's what Pascal means by the spirit of finesse.
3081000	3088000	And what my work is trying to show is that intelligence isn't primarily a formal system.
3088000	3094000	It's about the ability to make and then once they're made use formal systems.
3094000	3099000	And that's not that I'm trying to map everything onto the left and right because that can get very dangerous.
3099000	3100000	But think about this.
3100000	3106000	It's like, here's what can't be captured in any kind of formal system.
3106000	3114000	But nevertheless, it makes possible and is constantly shaping the possibility space for any formal system.
3114000	3117000	And so the two are deeply interpenetrating.
3117000	3120000	And I'm trying to say something like that.
3120000	3126000	See, I'm trying to maybe, sorry, this is audacious because I also respect Pascal the way you do.
3126000	3128000	But I'm trying to say it's not just, there's two.
3128000	3130000	There's a deep religio between them.
3130000	3136000	Finesse actually makes possible and fuels the spirit of geometry.
3138000	3139000	Yeah.
3139000	3140000	It makes sense.
3140000	3144000	And I think resisting our temptation to swing too far back the other way.
3144000	3145000	Okay.
3145000	3147000	We've had too much of this bad.
3147000	3152000	Let's have this different time of attention, this different kind of one.
3152000	3157000	Again, if we think everything is about connection, if we think everything is about relationship, everything is about interdependence,
3157000	3163000	then it's leaving those competitive instincts in us, right?
3163000	3165000	That are like, my way is right.
3165000	3166000	So your way must be wrong.
3166000	3168000	Or maybe we need each other.
3168000	3173000	Maybe we need the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finesse and they are designed to work together.
3173000	3177000	The imagery in my scriptures is of our body, right?
3177000	3183000	And the church is not always great at living this UK church right now, struggling with this.
3184000	3187000	But you know, the head cannot say to the foot, I do not need you.
3187000	3196000	When we are threatened, when we don't have a stable sense of self, when we do not know ourselves to be beloved,
3196000	3203000	the Rowan Williams talks about this in relation to God, like there's a relief sitting in the presence of the divine
3203000	3207000	because it's not constantly negotiating its identity in the way that we are.
3207000	3216000	And the more I know that which is not constantly negotiating, God's not constantly negotiating God's identity.
3216000	3223000	And in the presence of the divine, I no longer have to either, just loved, I'm a mess, I'm loved.
3223000	3226000	Then I can go into the world and encounter other messy people who are loved,
3226000	3231000	who are presenting a completely different spirit from me, functioning the world completely differently.
3232000	3239000	Naturally might threaten me because they don't care or they don't understand about the kind of things that we do, what this instincts in us.
3239000	3246000	But I can kind of have an open heart to that and go, tell me more, you know, that's interesting.
3246000	3248000	What can we learn from each other?
3248000	3250000	And that's so work for me.
3250000	3259000	That's like long, slow, steady muscle building of resisting the temptation to see everything in competition with each other.
3259000	3261000	Thank you for watching.

3281000	3283000	Okay, that's beautiful.
3283000	3285000	And that's a connection.
3285000	3293000	And let me, let me try and make a connection with some of my current work that other people are doing on.
3293000	3300000	Okay, so again, we think of logical as, and this is Descartes monological, what you do is the individual person running an argument.
3300000	3309000	And of course, subject predicate logic, and that's where we get our substance property ontology and it's all bound together in this wonderful package.
3309000	3322000	But the problem is that we're now, we now have increasing evidence growing rapidly that we actually reason better together dialogically than we do individually monologically.
3322000	3328000	Take standard reasoning tasks and individual does them and the success rates like 10%.
3328000	3334000	You replace that with four people who they have to dialogue with each other.
3334000	3341000	So what I call that dialogos, they have to do this shared group agency and mutual correctiveness.
3341000	3346000	But if they, if they do that, they get that success rate goes up to 82%.
3346000	3348000	Wow.
3348000	3352000	I mean, that the finding doesn't surprise me this status.
3352000	3353000	That's amazing.
3353000	3355000	It's, it is impressive.
3355000	3361000	The Sperber and Mercier have done some of the important work on this, but more and more people are showing this.
3361000	3367000	So, and this, of course, is part of why Plato and this always frustrated people.
3367000	3373000	Why doesn't Plato just write his arguments because Plato is trying to show because you have to show this, right?
3373000	3379000	That we reason best dialogically, not monologically, right?
3379000	3380000	Now think about that.
3380000	3388000	Think about how there has to be something that makes the dialogos possible.
3388000	3404000	And what you're talking about, if I understand you correctly, is you have a sensed participation in this presence that allows you to enter into and make possible a dialogical mode with others that actually is ultimately more reasonable.
3404000	3406000	Yeah.
3406000	3407000	Yeah.
3407000	3412000	That we are made in the image of a God who is relationship, right?
3412000	3415000	Even, even in the heart of the divine, there's no monologue.
3415000	3417000	It's no monad.
3417000	3422000	Okay, so that, and we're, so I'm going to invite you right now to come back.
3422000	3424000	We got to talk a lot more if you want.
3424000	3430000	Okay, so, so I've been, I'm doing, of course, ultimate reality, God and beyond.
3430000	3432000	Don't be put off by the title.
3432000	3445000	I'm trying to explore thinkers who are getting beyond the, the monological substance, subject predicate logic model of God, which I think has become predominant.
3445000	3452000	And then one of the things that I think is really strangling sort of current theism.
3452000	3466000	But James Filler's astonishing book, Heidegger Neoplatonism and the History of Being, he makes an argument that Neoplatonists were actually trying to argue that ultimate reality is pure relationality.
3466000	3468000	Information is purely relational.
3468000	3470000	Quantum entanglement is purely relational.
3470000	3472000	Relativity is purely relational.
3472000	3474000	Intelligibility is purely relational.
3474000	3478000	You can, you can get things out of relations, but you can't get relations out of things.
3478000	3481000	That's why we had the collapse of nominalism and all those problems.
3481000	3483000	It's an astonishingly brilliant book.
3483000	3492000	And then he makes the argument that Christian Neoplatonism is actually a kind of apogee because Christian Neoplatonism says yes.
3492000	3503000	And our sacred appreciation, and I'm trying to use that word in all of its meanings, our sacred appreciation of ultimate reality is very well captured in the image.
3504000	3508000	In an imaginal sense of an image, the image of the Trinity.
3508000	3510000	Like you said, God is not a monologue.
3510000	3512000	God is an inherently dialogical.
3512000	3520000	All, all of the persons are inherently relational in their nature and they're bound together.
3520000	3524000	And the identity claims of God are relational, logos, love.
3525000	3529000	And this is, and he's saying, people don't get this.
3529000	3550000	Although he says, I suppose this is shameless advertising for my friend, Bishop, Bishop Maximus, because Eastern Orthodoxy tries, is very much more awake and alive to these thinkers, the Cappadocian fathers, Dionysus, people like this, Maximus, obviously,
3551000	3564000	that, right, people don't get this because they're still trying to understand this presence, this pure relationality, this you that isn't bound to a specific thing, but somehow is the you of all youing.
3564000	3574000	I don't know if that even means anything, but that's how I, that's how I sort of understand it, and that they're trying to grasp that with the subject predicate logic.
3575000	3579000	And then they're trying to grasp it with substance property ontology.
3579000	3593000	And therefore they, the only way they misunderstand it is they think, well, it must be a super substance, a super thing that owns and is the author of all things and all properties between them.
3593000	3602000	And I think, and you may push back against me on this and that's fine, but I think this is an important thing that is happening right now.
3602000	3617000	I think there's an advent of the sacred going on, both within, I think people are groping towards that anemesis of this understanding that we once had in Christianity, I will put it that way, Neoplatonic Christianity,
3617000	3628000	and they're finding, not unsurprisingly, that it is deeply resonant with aspects of Zen Buddhism or Taoism, where the same language is being used in powerful ways.
3628000	3634000	And you very clearly state in the book that you're open to learning from other traditions beyond Christianity.
3634000	3637000	I understand Christianity is your home and I'm not trying to take you from it.
3637000	3649000	But I, so I've sort of laid my heart and my thought on the table about, like, and I know you're not doing this, so I'm not attributing to this to you.
3650000	3661000	I think saying God is love, that ultimate reality is ultimately relational is way, way, way, two more ways, way, way more radical than people realize.
3661000	3673000	It is a profound challenge to our default way of thinking, of interacting, of determining what's real, of sensing.
3673000	3679000	Like, it's, sorry, now I fall into a poria.
3679000	3682000	And I'm wondering if that lands with you.
3682000	3684000	Yes.
3684000	3686000	Yes, it does.
3686000	3692000	Because the word love has been worn out by overuse, right?
3692000	3694000	Oh, yeah, and trivialization.
3695000	3703000	Yeah, I, so I talk about sitting in the book quoting Francis Buffard, who forgive me, I'm going to swear for reader distance with sensitive is, but I think it's important.
3703000	3705000	He calls it the human propensity to fuck things up.
3705000	3707000	Oh, I think that's excellent.
3707000	3709000	Brute the brutality of it really helps me.
3709000	3712000	And when I interviewed him, I said, I need you to do the same thing for love.
3712000	3720000	And he just take this word, which is everything, and help us hear it again, because we can't hear it.
3720000	3724000	And it slides past our consciousness and it goes in one ear and out the other.
3724000	3728000	And to say God is love, reality is love, reality is relational.
3728000	3731000	All living is meeting.
3731000	3734000	Everything is relationship.
3734000	3735000	It's not strong enough.
3735000	3736000	It's not radical enough.
3737000	3744000	It's not profound enough to, and this is the key for me to make us change our behavior, to make us change our orientation and our heart posture.
3744000	3748000	It might make some people go, interesting, interesting ideas, interesting theories.
3748000	3750000	Oh, isn't that cute?
3750000	3752000	Lovely, nice.
3752000	3758000	Honestly, and I'm going to sound more like a like, I'm going to sound more like a Pentecostal preacher than I usually do.
3758000	3775000	But if it doesn't fundamentally in some way drive you to your knees, drive you into worship of some kind, into a seeking after and encounter with that love, then that's just like head knowledge.
3775000	3776000	Yeah.
3776000	3778000	I think that was beautiful.
3778000	3780000	You're pointing back to Pascal's fire, right?
3780000	3782000	If it doesn't have that fire, right?
3782000	3787000	Then the problem is, I mean, and, um, I mean,
3787000	3796000	I mean, other people have written about this, perhaps better than I, but, um, you know, we've trivialized love to being a feeling of love isn't a feeling.
3796000	3797000	That's ridiculous.
3797000	3801000	And then people think, oh, what love is an emotion and love isn't an emotion.
3801000	3803000	I love my partner profoundly.
3803000	3806000	And that sometimes makes me happy.
3806000	3808000	It sometimes makes me sad.
3808000	3809000	I miss her right now.
3809000	3820000	Sometimes it makes me angry if somebody is insulting her and I want to, because there is a function of emotion, of the emotion of anger, just to protect those things you genuinely value if they're threatened, right?
3820000	3823000	And you realize, oh, all of those are expressions of love.
3823000	3826000	All of those emotions are expressions of love.
3826000	3828000	So love isn't an emotion.
3828000	3831000	Love is an existential stance.
3831000	3834000	It's a, it's a way of being.
3834000	3842000	It's a way of participating in the identity of something or someone else and allowing them to participate in yours.
3842000	3843000	It's a religio.
3843000	3846000	It's a binding that reciprocally opens.
3846000	3848000	And then if you say, oh, okay, that's good.
3848000	3859000	And you say, but think maybe reality is a binding that reciprocally opens and maybe that's why our minds evolved to try and focus in on this as a fundamental thing.
3859000	3870000	Maybe that's the logos of the ontos, the ontology, the ontologos and our psyche logos is actually evolved to be able to track and conform to that.
3870000	3883000	And that experience, the one where we experience that most is in the experience of love understood in this wise way, not in as a feeling or not as, ooh, not as infatuation, not as desire.
3883000	3890000	You can like you, you, this is one of the most important tests for the longevity of love.
3890000	3893000	Do you love someone even when you don't desire them?
3893000	3895000	That's an important question to ask yourself.
3895000	3898000	And when you get a clear answer to that is yes, I do.
3898000	3900000	Then you go, oh, right.
3900000	3901000	Love isn't right.
3901000	3903000	Love, love can express itself in desire.
3903000	3909000	Hopefully so love can express itself in all these, but love is behind them all.
3909000	3918000	And it's because we have such a shallow notion of love that we find it so hard to believe that we people could say ultimate reality is love.
3918000	3921000	Well, oh, that's that's a very pleasant metaphor.
3921000	3922000	No.
3922000	3923000	Right.
3923000	3929000	You really open up with that is and then that opens you up to reality in a profound way.
3929000	3930000	Yeah.
3930000	3938000	I mean, I think you're right that the sort of conflation of romance with love is non, non erotic loves are as much the really real.
3938000	3939000	Like deep friendship.
3939000	3942000	We have devalued it parent child.
3942000	3950000	Like the though those loves are as much the root to wisdom and growth and fully aliveness as sexual love is.
3950000	3952000	And we just have devalued them.
3952000	3960000	But honestly, John, the thing that's making me think of and I'm sort of surprising myself by going here is that in my tradition, the symbol of love is a torture instrument.
3960000	3961000	Right.
3961000	3972000	It is that he opened his arms of love upon the cross that the that's another thing that keeps me on my tradition that it resists abstraction.
3972000	3987000	It resists generalization to the point of no bite through the incarnation and the crucifixion and the resurrection and the no greater love has anyone than this that they would lay down their life for their friends.
3987000	3989000	And that is what I think is.
3989000	3993000	Is it the Greek words that you just can no sis self emptying.
3993000	3994000	Yes.
3994000	3995000	The love.
3995000	3997000	Love as opposite of pride.
3997000	4001000	Love as opposite of withdrawal into ourselves as the toenail turned in ourselves.
4001000	4005000	But like outward to the point that we might even lay down our lives.
4005000	4008000	We might even empty ourselves.
4008000	4017000	And that that has been done for us is is is like gritty, dirty, bloody, painful, not fluffy.
4017000	4019000	You are not going to draw a Valentine's card about it.
4019000	4020000	Right.
4020000	4023000	It's just to do completely different things.
4023000	4024000	That's a very good point.
4024000	4025000	That's a very good point.
4025000	4030000	The cross prevents the Valentine's Hallmark carding of love.
4030000	4031000	That's a very good argument.
4031000	4032000	I like that.
4032000	4033000	I don't know if you're aware of it.
4033000	4034000	I think it's John Cobb.
4034000	4036000	The Christian theologian has an anthology.
4036000	4041000	I haven't read it yet, but I'm looking forward to it called the self emptying God, because
4041000	4048000	there's this ongoing discussion between Buddhists from the Kyoto school, like Maso Abe.
4048000	4054000	And there's Jewish theologians and Christian theologians all talking about this, this notion
4054000	4059000	of the self emptying God and how each one of your traditions says this is something very,
4059000	4062000	very central that has been lost.
4062000	4068000	And they find that obviously they don't all agree, because there's no sort of mush religion
4068000	4072000	that everything will dissolve into or anything ridiculous like that.
4072000	4078000	But they do all seem to be converging, at least on, we all want to talk about this and
4078000	4080000	make this more prominent.
4080000	4086000	Again, this notion, I think of kinosus and the connections between kinosus and theosis,
4086000	4093000	especially in the Eastern Orthodox, because if you hear theosis divination, right, the
4093000	4096000	Eastern Orthodox idea,
4096000	4101000	divination has been coming like God, not as in the lesson in Harry Potter.
4101000	4103000	Yes, yes, yes, exactly.
4103000	4106000	But it's all my level of references.
4106000	4113000	Well, the idea is, yeah, but you become it's not inflationary because the theosis is interwoven
4113000	4116000	with the most extreme form of kinosus.
4116000	4118000	Yes, you can be Godlike.
4118000	4119000	And you know what you have to do?
4119000	4124000	You have to do the most radical self emptying to participate in God, right?
4124000	4125000	And I think you're saying...
4125000	4127000	The first shall be lost.
4127000	4129000	Yes, yes, yes.
4129000	4134000	And I do think there's something important about this.
4134000	4141000	And I mean,
4141000	4145000	what's coming up for me now is,
4145000	4148000	Han and his book, Saving Beauty talks about the reduction of beauty.
4148000	4151000	We've taken the shock out of beauty, right?
4151000	4157000	And so I'm going to say something that I think an ancient would get, but a modern person would find
4157000	4158000	repellent.
4158000	4160000	I think the crucifixion is beautiful.
4160000	4163000	Not because it's pleasant or pleasing.
4163000	4171000	Han talks about how we've reduced beauty to the smooth, the easily gratifying, the easily graspable.
4171000	4176000	But if you read Plato and Platinus or read even Rilke, you know, beauty is an angel that
4176000	4178000	could kill us, but decides not to.
4178000	4181000	Like, come on, think of that language, right?
4181000	4184000	That's again, like, right?
4184000	4186000	The profound shock of it.
4186000	4187000	But it's...
4187000	4188000	But you did that.
4188000	4189000	You did this thing.
4189000	4196000	It's a shock that immediately you go, but of course, because if I didn't have that shock, it wouldn't
4196000	4200000	awaken me to what love really is.
4200000	4203000	And then that is what I mean by saying this is a kind...
4203000	4206000	So I'm saying it's not only that we've trivialized love.
4206000	4211000	We've trivialized beauty and those two things, those trivializations in some sort of...
4211000	4214000	I have a complicit, right?
4214000	4217000	Mutually reinforcing fashion that traps us.
4217000	4223000	And I think the epitome of that is pornography, because pornography is the reduction of love
4223000	4227000	and the reduction of beauty to the smooth.
4227000	4231000	And Han has a very good book on the agony of Eros.
4231000	4234000	You seem to be nodding when I was...
4234000	4237000	Is that also resonating with you?
4237000	4239000	I mean, so much of that is resonating with me.
4239000	4241000	I just can't order my many, many thoughts.
4241000	4246000	The first one was about beauty as...
4246000	4250000	Obviously Aquinas talks about goodness, truth and beauty as one way of thinking about God.
4250000	4255000	And we hear the beauty better like pretty, like nice.
4255000	4257000	And it...
4257000	4261000	Kant has a work on aesthetics, which is the only bit of Kant I know, to be clear.
4261000	4263000	And he...
4263000	4266000	He's thinking about the sublime and the numinous.
4266000	4267000	Is that like...
4267000	4269000	Actually, it's quite scary.
4269000	4271000	It's the bit...
4271000	4276000	It's when we encounter something that could kill us and does not.
4276000	4281000	And the way I think about it is that it sort of makes us feel right-sized.
4281000	4286000	That part of the agony of being a 21st century of human is that
4286000	4289000	we are trying to be something we are not.
4289000	4293000	Like we are trying, like relevance, whatever it was, that there's just so much.
4293000	4294000	There's so much.
4294000	4295000	And we're supposed to create ourselves.
4295000	4296000	We're supposed to decide.
4296000	4297000	We're supposed to know everything.
4297000	4298000	We're supposed to be across all these references.
4298000	4299000	We're supposed to have read everything.
4299000	4302000	We're supposed to be thin and successful.
4302000	4304000	And we're supposed to say the word from climate change.
4304000	4307000	And we're also just like, we are not gods.
4307000	4308000	We are not...
4308000	4309000	You've all...
4309000	4311000	No, Harari is wrong.
4311000	4312000	We are...
4312000	4314000	There is...
4314000	4315000	That is beyond us.
4315000	4317000	And when we encounter...
4317000	4319000	I think the real...
4319000	4324000	The real divine, the real God of love beyond us.
4324000	4327000	Yes, it's quite scary because we feel our smallness
4327000	4330000	and we feel our vulnerability and we feel our fragility.
4330000	4332000	And I think we feel our sin.
4332000	4334000	We feel our disconnection.
4334000	4338000	We feel all the ways we have not lived up to the kind of people that our soul longs us to be.
4338000	4343000	But it is also sort of a relief.
4343000	4347000	Because then we're rightsized and we know where we are.
4347000	4350000	The thing about porn is that was the scariest part to write
4350000	4354000	because I am basically trying to make quite a full-throated defence of the Christian sexual ethic
4354000	4356000	from a feminist perspective.
4356000	4358000	And to say, yes, I know...
4358000	4362000	I know, I know, I know that this church teaching around sin
4362000	4364000	has been used as a cost to beat people,
4364000	4367000	gay people and women in particular.
4367000	4369000	However, it...
4369000	4374000	At its heart, I think is about a refusal to treat another human being as an object
4374000	4382000	and a very, very high attunement to power imbalances.
4382000	4390000	And my argument against porn comes down to the disconnecting formation
4390000	4392000	of treating another person like an object.
4392000	4395000	Totally, totally. I think that.
4395000	4397000	So there's a couple of things that come up for me.
4397000	4400000	There's all this scientific work going on in awe right now.
4400000	4402000	I'm involved in it.
4402000	4404000	We're running an experiment.
4404000	4407000	Some of the work that's come out of it that seems pretty reliable.
4408000	4412000	Keltner and Jennifer Steller here at the University of Toronto
4412000	4414000	is awe does that proper proportion.
4414000	4415000	Awe is...
4415000	4419000	And think how it does relate to our word aweful, right?
4419000	4421000	But awe is...
4421000	4424000	People reliably report a shrinking of the self.
4424000	4427000	But one of the interesting things about awe is it's one...
4427000	4429000	Now, if you push it too far, that becomes horrific
4429000	4434000	because if the shrinking goes too far, you get horror, right?
4434000	4437000	But awe is...
4437000	4440000	It is one of the few experiences where the self shrinks
4440000	4442000	and people experience it positively.
4442000	4445000	It's not shame, right?
4445000	4447000	It's not depression.
4447000	4450000	It's shrinking, but it's positive.
4450000	4453000	And you know, this is Murdoch.
4453000	4457000	Love is the painful recognition that something other than yourself is real.
4457000	4459000	I propose, this is a hypothesis,
4459000	4465000	that that unselfing actually makes us realize a possible connection to reality
4465000	4470000	that we always longed for but didn't know that we were longing for it.
4470000	4475000	And that's why, although the self shrinks, we get something positive.
4475000	4477000	Now, for me...
4477000	4480000	And this is where I'm putting on my Cognitive Scientist hat,
4480000	4482000	but I'm going to also put on my Plato hat.
4482000	4486000	The thing about that is, like, you can imagine, right?
4486000	4489000	You can imagine that there's two sins.
4489000	4491000	Plato was worried about two things.
4491000	4493000	Drew Highland's book on finite transcendence,
4493000	4500000	that Plato was always trying to get us to get that we are always finite,
4500000	4504000	and that means finitude, fallible, right?
4504000	4507000	But we are also open to transcendence.
4507000	4512000	And he says, if we just fall into our finitude, we can fall into despair.
4512000	4515000	We can fall into horror, right?
4515000	4519000	We can lose a sense of the proper dignity of a person.
4519000	4521000	You could just... Right?
4521000	4523000	Right?
4523000	4527000	So, we have to also realize that we are responsible to transcendence.
4527000	4530000	But if we just identify with the transcendent pole,
4530000	4533000	then we suffer hubris and inflation.
4533000	4538000	And he says, what you have to do is you have to have a tonus.
4538000	4541000	You have to get this proper proportioning, proper sizing.
4541000	4544000	But it's... I'm trying to change it from size to...
4544000	4547000	When I'm not trying to change it, I'm trying to amplify your sizing
4547000	4549000	to making it inherently relational.
4549000	4552000	It's a sizing that puts you in a light relationship,
4552000	4556000	right position, like the right holding together of right,
4556000	4558000	your finitude and your transcendence.
4558000	4560000	And I think one of the problems we have,
4560000	4563000	and this goes to your polarization chapter,
4563000	4565000	is we have severed those.
4565000	4569000	And the left says, we're so finite, and we're so subject to fate,
4569000	4572000	and we need compassion, and they're right.
4572000	4575000	But the right says, but when they're both at their best,
4575000	4577000	because neither one of them is at their best right now.
4577000	4578000	They're at their worst right now.
4578000	4580000	But when they're at their best, and the right says,
4580000	4582000	yes, but we're not just animals.
4582000	4584000	We're persons called to responsibility.
4584000	4586000	We have a relationship to the true, the good, and the beautiful.
4586000	4590000	And then what you need is a dialogical relationship
4590000	4592000	between them for a healthy society.
4592000	4594000	And of course, we've abandoned all that.
4594000	4596000	We've polarized. We've changed that into...
4596000	4598000	Each side is now at its worst trying to kill the other
4598000	4600000	and demonizing the other.
4600000	4604000	I'm trying to bring a lot of what you said into one thing.
4604000	4609000	So I'm wondering if, because here's the thing,
4609000	4611000	and I got to be careful here.
4611000	4615000	So the research that's coming, that we're doing right now
4615000	4618000	seems to show something.
4618000	4621000	Sorry, there's a long time, but I'm sort of building an argument.
4621000	4622000	I love it. Keep going.
4622000	4623000	Okay.
4623000	4627000	So I thought, awe is this, right?
4627000	4629000	Opening up and everything.
4629000	4631000	So what you should see is if we induce awe experiences
4631000	4633000	and we have some reliable experimental techniques
4633000	4635000	using the overview effect and music,
4635000	4638000	and people can get sort of that awe, right?
4638000	4641000	Then you should see increased measures of cognitive flexibility
4641000	4643000	because those indicate that people's minds are opening
4643000	4645000	and they're exploring possibility.
4645000	4647000	So we induce awe and we do all these tests
4647000	4652000	and no measures of cognitive flexibility.
4652000	4654000	What awe predicts is a confidence
4654000	4656000	in any insight you might have.
4656000	4659000	Now, that can be very dangerous, as you can imagine,
4659000	4661000	but here's the proposal which I've been making
4661000	4663000	to my fellow researchers.
4663000	4665000	The point is an awe.
4665000	4669000	The point is a humble sense of the transcendent.
4669000	4672000	The point is reverence and reverence is a virtue.
4672000	4675000	And what the awe does is it gives you some confidence
4675000	4677000	to start cultivating reverence,
4677000	4681000	but you don't get the cognitive benefits
4681000	4683000	from the experience of awe.
4683000	4688000	You get the cognitive benefits from taking up the encouragement.
4688000	4690000	I use that word very deeply, right?
4690000	4694000	To cultivate a proper reverence.
4694000	4699000	What are you meaning by reverence in that context?
4699000	4702000	So what I mean by reverence is exactly that tonos,
4702000	4703000	that creative tension.
4703000	4704000	Sorry, I'm using a Greek word
4704000	4707000	because our English word tension is only negative for people now.
4707000	4710000	We forget Heraclitus, the tension of the bow,
4710000	4711000	the tension of the liar,
4711000	4714000	the tension that holds the bridge together.
4714000	4715000	Muscle.
4715000	4717000	Yeah, exactly.
4717000	4719000	And so I think of reverence,
4719000	4721000	and this is somewhat similar,
4721000	4726000	but I think also different with,
4726000	4728000	is it Woodruff's?
4728000	4729000	Woodward?
4729000	4732000	The book on reverence is a forgotten virtue.
4732000	4735000	But I think of reverence as a humble wonder
4735000	4739000	that we get the profound sense of our finitude.
4739000	4740000	That's the shrinking.
4740000	4744000	But we are wondering, not in the sense of curiosity.
4744000	4746000	Curiosity is trying to get something.
4746000	4750000	Wonder is calling things into question, including oneself.
4750000	4753000	We get a humble wondering towards things.
4753000	4755000	That's what I'm calling reverence.
4755000	4758000	And that takes time and effort to cultivate
4758000	4759000	because it's a virtue.
4759000	4762000	It's not just an experience.
4762000	4763000	That's what I'm talking about.
4763000	4764000	Okay, that's making sense to me.
4764000	4765000	Yes, that does.
4765000	4767000	So one of the things I reflect on a lot
4767000	4768000	are these peak experiences,
4768000	4769000	these ecstatic encounters
4769000	4772000	that have been really defining in my spiritual life,
4772000	4776000	but are not sufficient.
4776000	4777000	Exactly.
4777000	4780000	It really, it really,
4780000	4781000	when I talk to,
4781000	4782000	I'm sorry to bang on about this,
4782000	4784000	but I've got lots of friends at the moment
4784000	4786000	who are taking a lot of psychedelics,
4786000	4787000	and I'm very interested
4787000	4790000	in what it's doing to our spiritual landscape.
4790000	4792000	And there are some similarities
4792000	4794000	between the peak experiences they have
4794000	4796000	on psychedelics and the peak,
4796000	4798000	what I would call my experiences of the Holy Spirit.
4798000	4800000	We don't know because they go beyond language
4800000	4802000	and we can't actually compare them.
4802000	4804000	But we at least can see in each other
4804000	4807000	that something's happened, that it's big,
4807000	4809000	and it involves our bodies and our emotions,
4809000	4811000	as well as an idea.
4811000	4815000	And I was talking to my friend, Jules Evans,
4815000	4818000	about this recently as a psychedelic journalist.
4818000	4819000	Yeah, I know Jules.
4819000	4820000	Yeah, yeah.
4820000	4825000	And I was saying, I think,
4825000	4827000	I mean, within Christianity to be clear,
4827000	4828000	the fact that I'm a charismatic Christian
4828000	4829000	makes me quite a weirdo.
4829000	4830000	There are lots of us,
4830000	4833000	but it is not something that all Christians
4833000	4835000	have speaking tongues or have these
4835000	4837000	exotic encounters.
4837000	4839000	But the bit of, I would say my flesh
4839000	4842000	or the bit of me that's foolish
4842000	4843000	just wants it to be about those
4843000	4844000	because those are some amazing, right?
4844000	4845000	Super pleasurable.
4845000	4846000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4846000	4850000	Really connecting, really nourishing.
4850000	4853000	But they are,
4853000	4856000	and I think it was,
4856000	4859000	who has the pyramid of needs?
4859000	4860000	Maslow.
4860000	4861000	Maslow.
4861000	4862000	Talks about them as-
4862000	4863000	Actually, by the way,
4863000	4865000	that's a misattribution.
4865000	4867000	Maslow doesn't have that pyramid.
4867000	4869000	That was put in all the psychology textbooks
4869000	4871000	and attributed to Maslow.
4871000	4873000	Maslow is much closer to Aristotle
4873000	4875000	than to that pyramid.
4875000	4877000	Interesting.
4877000	4879000	By the way, beyond self-realization,
4879000	4880000	Maslow had a final thing
4880000	4882000	that doesn't show up on most pyramids.
4882000	4883000	He had self-transcendence.
4883000	4884000	Yeah.
4884000	4885000	So that's the,
4885000	4886000	this is making me feel better now
4886000	4888000	because that's the bit I quote.
4888000	4889000	Yeah.
4889000	4891000	So he's talking about the relationship
4891000	4893000	between religion and these exotic experiences.
4893000	4895000	And Maslow's fundamental understanding
4895000	4897000	is that religion is these moments of encounter
4897000	4899000	and then around it accrue all these dogmas
4899000	4901000	and these rules and these regulations
4901000	4903000	that stop looking like real religion,
4903000	4905000	which these ecstatic experiences.
4905000	4908000	And I'm like, no, Maslow.
4908000	4911000	The peak experience is,
4911000	4913000	I would say my experience with the Holy Spirit,
4913000	4915000	my moments of encounter with God
4915000	4918000	should send me back
4918000	4920000	into the rigorous spiritual path
4920000	4922000	of trying to grow in faith, hope and love
4922000	4924000	and love my neighbor.
4924000	4927000	And if they are just some solipsistic
4927000	4930000	self-actualization that,
4930000	4932000	in my tradition, this is sort of worse than useless
4932000	4936000	because spiritual gifts are for other people.
4936000	4938000	They are doggedly communal.
4939000	4942000	We receive these things to make us better
4942000	4944000	at loving each other.
4944000	4946000	And so I sort of joke with Jules
4946000	4949000	about charismatic Christianity is my set and setting.
4949000	4952000	Like, I need a book to come,
4952000	4954000	to check it against.
4954000	4957000	I need a community who are wise
4957000	4959000	and know me and will be like, no Liz,
4959000	4960000	that thing that happened to you
4960000	4961000	in that ecstatic experience
4961000	4963000	does not sound like it is going to lead you
4963000	4964000	towards love or fully aliveness.
4964000	4966000	It sounds like foolishness.
4966000	4969000	Also, you're getting a bit self-obsessed.
4969000	4972000	And I need, frankly, to be repeatedly told
4972000	4975000	that I'm mainly supposed to be feeding the pool,
4975000	4978000	like not getting out of my head
4978000	4981000	on divine love much as I need that
4981000	4983000	and want it and temperamentally,
4983000	4986000	it's where I would spend all my time.
4989000	4991000	I think that's right.
4991000	4993000	I'm teaching a course right now
4993000	4995000	on the nature and function of the self.
4996000	4998000	And it's just wrapped up.
4998000	5000000	And I had a student in there
5000000	5002000	and the work I was teaching
5002000	5004000	and the work the student was coming together,
5004000	5006000	converging on this idea
5006000	5008000	that these peak experiences,
5008000	5010000	they are, as you said, they're not sufficient.
5010000	5012000	They're necessary.
5012000	5013000	What they do is they,
5013000	5015000	and this is the term that's now emerging,
5015000	5017000	they create epistemic vulnerability.
5017000	5020000	They make you vulnerable to new ways of knowing,
5020000	5022000	new possibilities of seeing and being.
5022000	5024000	But if you don't have the setting
5024000	5026000	and I would add the sapiential framework
5026000	5028000	and ecology of practices
5028000	5030000	oriented towards the cultivation of wisdom and virtue,
5030000	5033000	that epistemic vulnerability can go,
5033000	5035000	it has the potential to go in multiple directions.
5035000	5037000	You get the conspirituality, right?
5037000	5040000	It makes you hugely vulnerable to abuse,
5040000	5043000	gurus, cults, blah, blah, blah.
5043000	5044000	That's right.
5044000	5048000	And so like you, I reject that idea
5048000	5050000	and Huxley has it to some degree,
5050000	5052000	that if we could just peel away
5052000	5056000	all of this, all of these doctrines and structures.
5056000	5059000	Now I'm very, I have issues around reducing
5059000	5061000	religio to credo.
5061000	5063000	We can talk about that when we talk next.
5063000	5067000	But I do agree with you that you need,
5067000	5071000	you need a practice and principles
5071000	5073000	and philosophical in the wisdom,
5073000	5076000	cultivating sense framework
5076000	5078000	that's housed, sorry, wrong word,
5078000	5081000	homed in a community for these peak experiences
5081000	5084000	to turn into transformative experiences
5084000	5089000	that are transforming people towards wisdom and virtue.
5089000	5092000	I think the evidence is mounting for that, by the way.
5092000	5093000	Yeah.
5093000	5094000	Great.
5094000	5096000	This is a good place to end, I think.
5096000	5101000	This has been truly full of wonder, wonderful in that sense.
5101000	5104000	I've really enjoyed this
5104000	5109000	and I hope that you found that you had enough,
5109000	5111000	that I wasn't talking too much,
5111000	5113000	that you have found enough time to speak.
5113000	5115000	I didn't want this to be an interview.
5115000	5117000	I wanted this to be the logos.
5117000	5119000	This is much more fun, a conversation.
5119000	5121000	Yeah, and yes, exactly.
5121000	5125000	And sparking insight and interest in each other,
5125000	5129000	asking interested questions rather than interesting questions.
5129000	5132000	That's a distinction that my friend,
5132000	5136000	Mr. Firmaster-Pietro, has brought into the dialogical practice.
5136000	5138000	But I definitely want you to come back
5138000	5142000	and I hope we can continue and doing,
5142000	5143000	diving a little bit more.
5143000	5146000	Maybe we can do a little bit more about the vices
5146000	5149000	and the virtues and a little bit more, again,
5149000	5151000	about what we were talking about.
5151000	5155000	And what is the relationship between religio and credo?
5155000	5158000	And how do we hold that relationship in the context
5158000	5161000	of a lot of the things we seem to be resonating
5161000	5162000	and converging on?
5162000	5164000	That's what I propose for our next discussion.
5164000	5166000	Sounds brilliant.
5166000	5170000	So, Elizabeth, I always give my guests the last word.
5170000	5174000	You can be cumulative, summative, provocative, elusive,
5174000	5176000	whatever you want to say.
5176000	5180000	I'm so tempted to go nitwit, blubber.
5180000	5185000	What is my last word?
5189000	5193000	I think holding onto the fact that love is the really real.
5193000	5195000	If you had to bore wisdom down to that,
5195000	5198000	you wouldn't go far wrong.
5198000	5199000	Yeah.
5199000	5201000	Thank you so much.
5201000	5204000	I look forward to our next discussion.
5204000	5206000	Thank you so much for having me.
