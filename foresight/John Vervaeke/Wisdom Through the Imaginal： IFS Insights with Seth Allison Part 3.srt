00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome everyone to Another Voices with Raveke. I'm excited about this one.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,960
This is a third episode with Seth Allison and we are doing this ongoing discussion about IFS work,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,800
parts work in general, ally work, issues around the functionality, the phenomenology, the ontology,

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,600
issues around what's dangerous and what's safe. And we have a few more things we wanted to talk

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,880
about. We didn't really talk about exiles last time. I want to talk about that a bit. But before

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,160
we do any discussion, I'm going to let Seth quickly reintroduce himself and then Seth propose

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,520
something and I'll let him make the proposal on air. And I've agreed. So I'm going to turn things

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:55,280
over to Seth. Hi, John. Thank you very much. It's really great to be back again. And I just want to

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,000
begin by saying I appreciate that, although I said in our last conversation that I'm sure Dick

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Schwartz is not watching, it turns out he was. And he reached out and just had a lovely correspondence

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:25,040
with him. And primarily it was a lot of praise for our discussion and appreciation that we're

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,440
doing this publicly. He did offer a very helpful couple of corrections. The first one is the IFS

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:43,760
concept of self being kind of a smaller self embedded in a bigger self. So the seed of consciousness

14
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,280
that we've talked about is kind of the personal essence of a larger self that is involved.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,760
There's a functional relationship between those two. Okay.

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,720
Yeah, sort of self and self. I guess capital S might be the interior personal self and all

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:14,240
caps as ELF would be a larger self, probably perhaps similar to Jung's concept of self.

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah, I would say the seed of consciousness is the I in the I me relationship of James.

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
And then the self is something like the ground of the psyche, Atman.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,040
Very good. Yeah, I love that language. I love that language. The other thing, which maybe we'll come

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,120
back to, we've been talking about your experience with Hermes and guide and guides is a term that

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,360
they use in IFS. I misspoke and said that guides were a part of the internal personal system.

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,960
In other words, a different form of part. Very helpful correction to say that is not,

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,720
it is transitive. Oh, that's important. Well, can you please? Very important for both of these.

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
The first one, yeah, I get the second one is, Oh, could you please thank him for these corrections?

26
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,160
I think that's wonderful to know that he concedes of the guides as transjective in nature.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,560
That means there's a potential deep integration between IFS and ally work, at least the way

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm interpreting ally work. I think so. I think they are exceptionally compatible.

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:38,720
And as we may have mentioned before, but Dick does the forward to Falconer's most,

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:49,440
think most recent book, the other. Yes, I have that. Yes. And it is, I really appreciate the

31
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,480
forward he wrote because he expresses his reluctance to talk about the topic. I think as we talked

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:06,320
about Dick's bio before, it's very important to remember that the experience near focus that he

33
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:12,960
is maintained with such discipline, actually, as he also tries to avoid being alienated from the

34
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,960
academy and the mainstream. And so he was very hesitant to go there publicly, although I think

35
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,840
that the idea of guides and the, by the way, the, which is fascinating this, the Falconer's book is

36
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,640
primarily about kind of the other end of the continuum, which would be they call unattached

37
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,200
burdens. I think in Christian tradition, we might call it the demonic, but across cultures,

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,880
this is has many different names. But it is not a part of the system, much like the guide is not

39
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
a part of the system. So there's kind of a distinction between daemons and daemons, if I can put it

40
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,160
out. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I wanted to make sure we noted that that is now formally

41
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,120
that's an amazing theoretical move. I, from what you said, it sounds like he appreciates the work

42
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
we're trying to do. Because I am, of course, trying to integrate this with cognitive science

43
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,120
while being respectful and doing participation in the experience near aspect of all of this.

44
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,000
He expressed gratitude and appreciation, which and certainly did not have to reach out. So it was,

45
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,000
I was, I was touched by it. And so I think, I think actually that

46
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,280
this is a part of what we are doing is very congruent with his, I would go so far as to say,

47
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:51,360
you know, his larger mission that he feels tasked with to bring inner work, a model, we're going

48
00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:00,000
to talk about safety. And I think one of the things I'll propose to you is that IFS represents

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:10,960
maybe the safest mainstream technology we have for exploring for interception and the exploration

50
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,960
of different levels of consciousness and reality, where there it's, it's opening

51
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:28,560
a, the just degradated imaginal space that our culture has just abandoned. And I think doing it

52
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:37,440
in a way that is not only powerful, but responsible. So I, you know, I, I think this fits really well

53
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,520
with the larger mission. I think that's true. And when we talk about that, and we talk about

54
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,840
corresponding dangers, this is again, where I'd like to talk about the Socratic shift,

55
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,920
the shift into the dialogical self as opposed to the monotonic, monological,

56
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,560
monophasic, monostage self, although all the monos that have afflicted us and created what

57
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,760
Charles Taylor's called the buffered self. And there's probably historical reasons, the collapse

58
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,360
of the church as an institution, Protestantism, et cetera, the scientific revolution, the self

59
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
had to be really buffered and protected. It couldn't remain as porous as it was. But now

60
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,160
that adaptive stance has become maladaptive, and it's suffocating us and strangling us off

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
from reality. And so I want to sort of explore that possibility.

62
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:42,400
I, so we've, we've talked leading up to this about doing a session here that you will have the,

63
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,840
the right certainly to make public or private, which I'm very excited to do. And your nervousness,

64
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,360
I agree, I think it confirms that it's a good idea. And I feel, I feel a degree of anxiety too,

65
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,280
but I'm very excited to do that together. It is such an opportunity to

66
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,280
show the model in a way that can only really, you can't really get a lot of this without seeing it.

67
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,680
And so I think it would be a great service. That being said, I have so much that I've written

68
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,560
down about the topic we're currently talking about. So maybe I could throw some things out to you.

69
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,440
Some of which are going to be your own words, because I really enjoyed and want to refer people

70
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,800
to conversation you did. And I'm forgetting their last names, but it was Michael and Michael.

71
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,360
Michael Martin is one of them. I forget you and Michael. Yeah.

72
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,320
Yes. And it was really great. So I'd like to give some highlights, but also make sure people.

73
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,400
Great. So I want to start with some quotes that are right along the lines of what we're talking

74
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:05,280
about with Western culture. And these are taken from Faulkner's book. So he quotes Bernardo-

75
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Yeah, I'm going to be talking to Bernardo about all of this, because he has a daemon that he

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,600
regularly works with. Yes. Yeah. Great. Right. And he says that we're in the dark ages of materialism

77
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:27,760
and behaviorism. And then I think it's George, or perhaps Bernjanos. You understand absolutely

78
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,400
nothing about modern civilization unless you first admit that it is a universal conspiracy

79
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:43,360
against the interior. And this makes me think of the work that you're doing,

80
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,640
which I wanted to help people perhaps understand the intersection of the pursuit of wisdom with

81
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:02,800
the work of the imaginal that we're exploring here. And the proposal here is that the imaginal,

82
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,000
as a way of gaining information and wisdom, is crucial to rationality.

83
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,880
And I've been making that argument. I appreciate Corban's how the imaginal is the mystical.

84
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,120
But I think the imaginal, like many other things, like flow and insight, is on a continuum where

85
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,520
there is the mundane of the imaginal that is in our everyday experience. The experience of the

86
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,160
introspective space inside our head, that's imaginal. There isn't a literal space there,

87
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,200
that makes no sense. But it's not just fictional, because it actually gives us genuine access to

88
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
our cognition and affords metacognition and rationality. So it's neither literal nor fictional,

89
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,160
it's imaginal. And that's just part of your everyday ability as a rational agent.

90
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,960
That, and I'm looking for it here, and it's one of the poets

91
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,840
talked about the secondary imagination and the primary imagination. And I think you're referring

92
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,520
to the secondary imagination. Coolridge had a distinction between fancy and imagination,

93
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,000
where fancy is just where you're just playing with. But imagination was the imaginal very much, yeah.

94
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Right. And I think a quality of that is that it is a dialogue, that it is relational.

95
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,360
There is a degree of activity and engagement, not just a passive self.

96
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,840
So like Jung's concept of active imagination is not fantasy. It's this, the liminal space between

97
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,040
where consciousness interacts with the unconsciousness. He called it, I think the psychoid space where

98
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:50,160
things are crossing over through the archetypal. So I think Falconer says that we are, we need to

99
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:58,960
learn how to navigate the inner world to increase interoception, right, which is the looking in,

100
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:07,440
the study inward, our ability to see and interact and the interact part is key with our inner world.

101
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,680
So there's this, is he using this distinction? It sounds like it's close, but I want to make

102
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,400
sure I'm not smuggling in in equivocation by not excavating it. So in cog size psychology,

103
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,040
introspection means where you go into that space where you can do like mathematics in your head

104
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,840
or picture a sailboat. Interoception is your awareness of your body. Like when I ask you,

105
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,480
how's your right big toe doing? And you can go, it's okay. That's interoception. So it's very

106
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,480
somatically, functionally oriented interoception. Introspection is much more cognitively,

107
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,520
you know, I don't know what to call it, more and more cognitively oriented. I'll just say that right

108
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,920
now. I love that you're bringing it to the body and somehow it also connects to,

109
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,600
and it's tricky to tease out, but like being embodied in the psyche.

110
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,400
Go ahead. What are you going to say? Body, just what they are, they do overlap and there's a

111
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:13,200
liminal space where you can't tell which is which. And both introspection and interoception have an

112
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,320
imaginal quality to them. Introspection, very high imaginal. The interoception is closer to

113
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,560
detection, but there's still an imaginal element to it because you're still doing predictive

114
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,360
processing. You're still taking little samples and imagining the whole from them, all that stuff.

115
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,680
Great. Great. So the general sense here, I wanted one more quote for you is John Keats.

116
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,320
When a man is capable of being in uncertainty, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching

117
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,640
after fact and reason, he calls this negative capability.

118
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
I think the romantics at their best were discovering the imaginal.

119
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
I think the romantics at their worst were not realizing the deep interconnections

120
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,320
between the imaginal and the rational. Which brings me to danger.

121
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,640
There was a great quote. Where is it here?

122
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,560
Yeah, this was in Faulkner. The ability to become absorbed in our inner world is much

123
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,880
like fire, a wonderful servant, but a dangerous master. So I want to kind of move in a little bit

124
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:46,880
to some of your work. And I'm going to kind of frame this a little bit from just pulling out

125
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:54,400
some of the things that I think are interesting. So a little context with the meaning crisis.

126
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,120
These are just sort of domains. You've called it a wisdom famine.

127
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:11,040
I am adding to that the degradation of our imaginal faculties, an atrophy of our spiritual

128
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,360
musculature, a disconnection from nature, but also from our embodied selves,

129
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
a loss of relational and communal resources and embeddedness,

130
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,800
and a loss of our dialogical facility. I think I would just sort of put that as the context.

131
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,360
All of that together and brought into a kind of joint attention on the transcendentals and

132
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,720
through that the sacred. This goes back to the fear of the Lord as the beginning of all wisdom

133
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,560
kind of idea. Where I don't take that to mean fear. I take it to mean something like reverence.

134
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:59,040
That there is always a normative dimension to wisdom which is moving towards the true,

135
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,400
the good, and the beautiful. And that's rationality in the deep sense. The ability to be sensitive to

136
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,360
and reliably responsible to the call of the true, the good, and the beautiful. And then through the

137
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,640
true, the good, and the beautiful, ultimacy. An ultimacy that we can love. And so everything

138
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,240
you said, but held in concert together, sort of knowedically held in concert together,

139
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:31,280
directed towards the sacred in that way. Love it. And we don't have much

140
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,200
in the way of structures, teachers, pathways, practices

141
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,680
that we can call on now. So this is how I frame you're working on developing an ecology of

142
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,040
practice and the work of the Verveki Foundation. How do we bring this back? Unfortunately, religion

143
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,080
for a lot of us has lost its credibility or lost its safety.

144
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,200
That was beautifully put. I just want to savor that. That was so succinct and captures

145
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,800
it. It's lost its credibility. If we include in that not just truth but relevance, people,

146
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,880
but also lost its safety for many people. Religion has, all the religions have piled up

147
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,440
sins and the good people within those religious legacies are taking responsibility for that.

148
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,360
I don't want to pretend that they're not. But nevertheless, there's trauma on one end

149
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,800
and it just doesn't work for me. I know lots of people who say, I want it to work for me.

150
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,040
I wish. I mean, in some ways, that's my case too. I feel like Corellian from Childhood's End,

151
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I can always point people to their sacred home, but I will always be on the Silk Road kind of thing.

152
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:03,040
And so I just wanted to pause, Seth, and just open that up, expand that because I thought that was

153
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:10,640
beautifully put. Yeah, boy, that what you just shared resonated very deeply for me.

154
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
In fact, these conversations have caused me to dive into,

155
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
for lack of a more precise term, and I need something that holds all of this. I'll just say

156
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:36,240
spirituality in a way that I wasn't sure I would ever be able to again. I grew up, I think,

157
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:44,080
we both grew up in conservative Christianity. For me, it was evangelical Christianity and

158
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:56,640
some of the splits and the disavowed elements of humanity that I grew up with there,

159
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,960
I found deeply wounding and even traumatizing. And my psyche has been so bent and twisted around

160
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,200
some of the unhealthy interpretations of Christian tradition that I had to throw the baby out with

161
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:21,360
the bathwater for a couple of decades. And I don't know if I'll come back to it, but I'm just,

162
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,800
in the last couple of months, beginning to feel like, okay, I'm going to have to, I think I'm

163
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,760
called to a path back, but probably not to anything that I would recognize as Christianity from my

164
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,640
past. And actually, it feels like creating a new path and yet probably more than anything

165
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,440
discovering a very important thing. That's exactly what the Silk Road is. Silk Road allows,

166
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,560
nobody lives on the Silk Road, this is like C.S. Lewis's hallway Christianity, nobody lives in

167
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,960
the halls, people live in rooms, but you need the halls, right? Boy, I feel like I've lived

168
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,120
in a hallway for a while. Yeah, we're resonating on that. Yeah, I actually have a tattoo of the

169
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:19,360
word Lyman, the root of liminality for years. And hopefully I can look at that. I'm starting

170
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:30,000
to look at that as a period of time that so much had to be put through a crucible. Go ahead.

171
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,840
Well, for me, it's becoming the living symbol on of how I am being called.

172
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,640
Like people are traveling on the Silk Road that are seeking a place, a new home, but it also is

173
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,440
hopefully affording people to return to their homes and recover it the way Tolkien talks about

174
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,840
the recovery theory or the way an anthropologist goes to another culture and then comes back and

175
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,160
can see this same culture, T.S. Eliot, see it again for the first time kind of thing. And

176
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,920
the Silk Road will be the Silk Road if it is doing that. And I can't justify what I'm about to say,

177
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:15,360
so perhaps in one sense it's how I'm remaining imaginably faithful. I feel called that I need

178
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,160
to be in this liminal state right now because opening this up so that the legacy religions can

179
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,560
more deeply enter into profound, mutually transformative theologos. And this is already

180
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,600
happening. This is not something I am initiating. One of the functions of the series is to call

181
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,200
this up and show people and see all the resources and see what's happening. And the Verveke Foundation

182
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,760
is committing itself to trying to explicate this, foreground it, elucidate it, make it available

183
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,560
for people. And this comes out of discussions with Hermes. I've come from

184
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:58,720
grieving my liminality to, so I was always, in one discourse with Hermes, it's like,

185
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,800
it really bothers me that I'm almost. What do you mean? I was like, well, you know,

186
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm sort of almost famous and I'm almost this and I'm almost this and almost this. And he said,

187
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,120
John, I don't know if I mentioned this to you. He said, first one thing, he said,

188
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,240
well, that's great because almost famous means you can interact with the famous,

189
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,840
but you're protected from the temptations and corruptions. And then we return to this again.

190
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,840
And I said, there's still something. And it was like, yeah, because you don't get it. You need to

191
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,520
be almost because a traveler is almost. You need to travel the road. You need to be almost right

192
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,040
now. Don't know what the future is, but right now you need to be an almost. You need to accept it.

193
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,080
That is your calling. That is what you need to be and you need to do. And when it moved to that,

194
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:49,440
it was like, and I was and I was really in a tough place because and I've had one conversation.

195
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
We're going to publish a private one and then public one. We're going to publish and doing

196
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:02,560
another one with Jordan Hall. Jordan Hall's conversion really impacted me. There was a

197
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,320
lot to sort through there. And I mean, part of it was, you know, a feeling of abandonment.

198
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,960
He and I had been brothers on this path and he suddenly had found a home and I felt, right?

199
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,120
But of course, I love him as a friend and I want the best for him. And we're trying to see,

200
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,680
does his pro does his current project and my projects, do they still can they still

201
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,320
enter into Deologos with each other? It looks like it is. But I needed that inner work. I couldn't

202
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
just do the outer discussion with Jordan. I needed that inner work to get, ah, this is where I have

203
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,120
to be right now. He's where he needs to be. I have enough faith in him that that's the case.

204
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,120
But I need to have faith in myself that this is where I need to be and what I need to be doing.

205
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,000
And that also went into a good conversation with Christopher Master Pietro. So you get this sort

206
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,600
of thing happening that's inner and outer kind of like union synchronicity, not as, you know,

207
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
pronounced, but it's that sort of inner and outer worlds are sort of really talking to each other

208
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:10,640
really well. So I just wanted to relate that that that that and I'm not I'm not saying that this is

209
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:17,040
your call at all. I'm just saying for me, I appreciate and I hear the pain in your voice

210
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:26,560
because and I know the pain and there is a longing and I hope that my work can help people of good

211
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:34,320
faith who genuinely are experiencing that longing both within and without a legacy religious home.

212
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,920
That is my that is what I want to do. That is what I am committed to do because I think this

213
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,840
advent of the sacred that is happening right now and I think part of what we're talking about that

214
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,520
is exactly the expression of the advent of the sacred. I think that is what is needed

215
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,640
for everybody who wants to be on the Silk Road.

216
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:07,520
Thank you. Thank you. We share something deep and it's important to integrate and it's also

217
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,200
important to differentiate because that allows for reflection and mutual transformation.

218
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,000
That's that's why I wanted to do that. Thank you for watching this YouTube and podcast series is

222
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,160
If I could take a risk to to meet you there. I think I've told you this. I can't remember

223
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,200
if I it was on camera or off, but I actually have a Hermes tattoo on my ankle and so

224
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,040
it felt quite synchronous to me when you started sharing and

225
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:09,600
the the grieving that you mentioned, to me, part of entering liminality, which I did not choose to

226
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:16,800
do and I don't know that any of us would ever choose to do it, was the grieving literally

227
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,640
and figuratively the many-leveled grieving of the loss at home. Yes, yes, and

228
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:36,640
but the learning to live in the discomfort that Keats is talking about, to me the metaphor that

229
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:44,800
helped the most was that I am now exhausted and can no longer row this boat. I have to put the oars

230
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:54,960
in and begin to trust a current and I have no choice about it. So I will see where the river goes

231
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,840
and I will spend my time trying to look at the shore and what's passing and that begins to develop a

232
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:15,360
stance of participation without the ego doing all of its work and that could not, I could not

233
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:25,920
learn that at the pace I wanted to. It was a slow letting go over and over again and it did,

234
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,000
you know, I not only dealt with depression but you know the the movement into addiction and then

235
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,720
out of addiction was really the beginning of awakening of spirituality as it is for so many

236
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,240
millions of people. What capitalism has come up with this wonderful way for creating pervasive

237
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,640
low-grade addiction through the salience, the salience manipulations of social media and

238
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,680
advertising, etc. I'm not sure how low-grade it is anymore. I think we're just habituated to it.

239
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,920
Yeah, it's killing people so it's in one way is very high-grade. Yes, you're right.

240
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:17,360
Yeah, well and it is absolutely crushing the meaning in our world and our access to our inner

241
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:26,080
life were consumed by dopamine addiction that just consumed by it. So thank you. It's wonderful

242
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:36,160
to connect on this deeper level. Well, when you said that about the river, so there's a song,

243
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,840
it's a little bit cheesy but I really like the song Moon River and I came to was the line,

244
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:47,040
you know, up beyond the river's bend, my Huckleberry friend and that kind of shared sense of

245
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,840
I'm in the same place with you. I don't know what I don't know what's around the river's bend

246
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,760
and I've stopped trying to plan what it's going to be and I'm going to, you know, the Buddhism,

247
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,160
I'm going to enter the stream. I'm going to do it carefully but I'm going to enter. But that's the

248
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:13,280
that's the that's the conversion spirit. That's the movement of the ego and the dropping into

249
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:24,640
a different eye position. And it allows in IFS that allows access to the exiles that have lost

250
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,840
so much or that are carrying grief and pain that must be let go. So well, I think IFS,

251
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,600
we're going to get to what an amazing tool it is for spiritual work.

252
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:48,160
Man, I hate to jump back up, you know, but I do want to just a couple more pieces here.

253
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,520
By the way, I think the facility, I mean, we're doing in and out and that's good, but I think

254
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,840
jumping up and down, you need you need practice with that too, because you don't want it to be

255
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,080
jarring. You want it, I talk about Theoria and theory, they need to flow. That's another

256
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
tearing that we have to sew back together and heal.

257
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,360
Well, I've always thought of it as intellectual scaffolding that the manager,

258
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,480
manager parts of me that are hyper rational, which are really just very fearful.

259
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,640
They, they, they, they really need the map quite, they need it badly in order to relax. And so it

260
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,200
isn't, it is important. So let me just throw some things out or actually just repeat them and mirror

261
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,280
them back to you because these are your thoughts. The hermeneutics of experience, the ways in which

262
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:51,360
reality is disclosed to us. You, you talk about four dimensions of cultivating wisdom, the

263
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,680
dialogical, the imaginal, the mindful in the embodied. Do I have that right?

264
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,200
Yes. That's correct. Dime. Yeah. Did what work with that with Nathan Vanderpool? Yes.

265
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,520
I, I love this. And it, it, those almost act in my mind as, as the categories that we can use as

266
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,840
safeguards as we enter into spiritual practice. They're all domains in which we can cultivate

267
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,240
being reasonable, right? Looking for self deception, properly proportioning our salience,

268
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
taking the right perspective, assuming the right responsibility and role.

269
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,760
They are all ways in which we can bring reasonableness to bear on what we're doing.

270
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:41,280
So let me read some more of your thoughts to you. So I want to set the context again that we're

271
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,760
entering a period with psychedelics in particular, but also the field of psychology coalescing around

272
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:58,000
a dialogical self that altered states, experiential modalities, psychedelics, these are profound

273
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,960
opportunities for confronting the meaning crisis as we, as we set it up earlier in this

274
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,080
conversation. I'm going to assert that our primary problem here with these experiential

275
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,840
learnings is that we lack structures to hold the process of integration, not, not the doing,

276
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,240
but the after the integration. I think the integration is important. The integration is

277
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,560
important. It's, it's, it's more important actually than the experience itself.

278
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,400
That's what I meant to say. It is more important and the integration is in both of those dimensions

279
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,360
again. How well does it integrate with many domains broadly and deeply in your life?

280
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,960
How well does it transform many levels broadly and deeply of the psyche? That's the integration

281
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,520
and you are absolutely correct. Our culture gives us freshest little on both of those and even more

282
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,720
importantly, not only both of them, but how they are properly coordinated and speak to each other

283
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,880
in a self-correcting fashion. Oh, this is going broadly and deeply. Yeah, but it's keeping me

284
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,640
locked in this one level of psyche. Oh, that's, oh, it's going so much inside of me. Yeah, but it's

285
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:15,280
not transferring into your life. Think about that, right? So that, so the, what the poet and the

286
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:24,960
artist do is they, they have the equipment and the musculature to dive deep the canaries down in

287
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,560
the coal mine of the psyche, but to excavate and bring back for us. And I think, you know, my experience

288
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:39,360
with Psychedelics is, it gets you down there. It gets you down there, but the challenge of

289
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,200
bringing it back up is, is profound. It's easy to take psilocybin. It's not difficult. It is very

290
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,080
difficult to bring back what you learn and to integrate it. I agree. And in our culture, again,

291
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,680
super salience of the intensity of the experience that can be consumed, very little attention to

292
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:08,000
the cultivation of virtue. Right. So you have these two axes of intensity, right? We talked about this

293
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,640
back in our attachment talk of the COGSI processing, but the linear integration of if this, then this,

294
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,880
then this. And so the bringing this and this together is hard work. You need a framework.

295
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,400
And it cannot be done. It can't be done alone. And so whether it's the intellectual framework,

296
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,480
or even better, is a relational, dialogical framework in community, I think is the safest way

297
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,560
to proceed with this stuff. And the most I call it a sapiential framework, because I don't,

298
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,200
I think the word intellectual, it's the right word if we use it the way the Neoplatonist used it

299
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,800
for noesis, but we don't use it that we sapiential wisdom. It's an actually word,

300
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,960
it's an archaic word, but I'm trying to bring it back because we need an alternative word to

301
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,680
both intellectual and spiritual. And this word, I think is, it is a real word.

302
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I'm going to add it, I'm going to add it to my verbate dictionary that I'm beginning to write.

303
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,120
So let me, let me give you some things that you said with Mike and Michael that you laid

304
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:27,440
this out really well. You quoted or summarized Drew Highland, Platonic scholar. We are simultaneously

305
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:36,000
finite and capable of transcendence. If we embrace our finitude, or if we only, sorry,

306
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,160
if we just embrace our finitude, we fall prey to despair and servitude. Love that.

307
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,080
So I think that's our current state in many ways. And then we have, I think in some hyper-religious

308
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:58,240
communities, we have the opposite. If we just embrace our transcendence, we fall prey to inflation

309
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,880
and hubris. By the way, it's not just in religious communities. There's a real danger in

310
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,600
psychological. Oh, totally. Totally. People think they become the voice of God. Yes, I know.

311
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,760
Yeah. So that's the extreme of inflation and hubris. If we hold them together in tension,

312
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:23,360
tonos, we will properly realize our humanity. I want to say that again. If we hold them together

313
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,960
in tension, our finitude and our transcendence, we will properly realize our humanity.

314
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:39,360
The middle path is to live in tonos. And I think your work is, is that, I think that's a wonderful

315
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:48,080
summary of, of what I am experiencing in your work as being aimed at. So here's, here's how

316
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:55,360
I think you framed the opportunity at this point in time in our culture. Or the challenge

317
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,320
which you said earlier, how do we metabolize mystical experiences or experiences of the

318
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:08,480
numinous, right? So you said opening to other dimensions of cognition in the psyche is epistemically

319
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:18,720
and morally a pursuit that we are called to. There's this huge family of phenomena

320
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,880
and this scientific investigation into it, not just practices, but participatory knowing,

321
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,960
which I think feels scary. Proper, careful, rigorous, reflective study from the outside

322
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:44,480
and the inside. Love that. We have a moral, these are your words, we have a moral obligation to ask,

323
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,880
what is a proper framework to bring to bear upon these experiences so that people could metabolize

324
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,240
them and realize them as the cultivate, cultivation of virtue and wisdom. And I like this part,

325
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,960
and not spin them off into narcissism or inflation and go down rabbit holes of their own

326
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:10,720
personal magical medicine. I don't know, you spun that one off, it was great. I mean, there's the

327
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,040
idea of inflation and hubris, right? And you talked about the scientific gaze,

328
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,560
and Michael had concern about the scientific gaze, and you said it's not a dissecting gaze,

329
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:34,160
but the intention is to afford the flourishing of this practice.

330
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,520
So I thought I'd pause there and let you, I mean, do you want to reiterate any of that? I'm just

331
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,960
summarizing, I think the big picture. No, no. I think you've made judicious choices in so far as

332
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:59,120
they captured the gist of what I was arguing for. I don't have any significant revisions or

333
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:06,080
amendments to what you've brought up, other than the ones that have spontaneously been occurring

334
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:16,800
between us. I just, I'm happy this, I'm having this conversation, these series of conversations

335
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,080
with you, we get into Genuine Dialogos. I'm appreciating the relationship that's growing.

336
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,360
I just want to say that I think that is, like you said, that is a proper

337
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:39,920
safety framing of working with the numinists in an important way. Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

338
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,280
I had some hallmarks of safety, but I think we've covered a lot of it,

339
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,040
and I'm looking at the time and just wanting to make sure we leave space for a dropping in

340
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:04,720
and an embodiment of a practice of IFS, which you have courageously been willing to kind of join

341
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:14,480
me in this. I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have that sense of calling. This is not what I'd

342
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:23,040
like to do, but I'm called. So please continue with what you want to emphasize. Well, I think

343
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,160
we're called together. I feel called to this too. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I have a very friend. We're

344
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:39,440
called together. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Very nice. So the way that I often ask people to

345
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:49,200
enter in is to close their eyes and to check in with their body. So if I will say this before we

346
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:58,560
start to the people watching that I would encourage them to bring curiosity and compassion.

347
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,760
You and I hold this energy together right now, but in some weird, unexplainable way, I think

348
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,080
the energy of the audience matters too. I think we're both going to be a little bit,

349
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:22,240
parts of us will be afraid. And we're going to try to, you and I will try to sit with that.

350
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,920
And I think the more we sit with those parts, the more others will be able to. And I just want to

351
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:37,920
voice my faith in that because I've seen that with you. Yeah, so let me walk you in and we'll

352
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,120
walk in together. If you close your eyes, check in first with your body. And in the spirit of

353
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:54,560
EFT, I want to just be responsive to any areas that feel tight or unsupported,

354
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,400
any stretching or adjusting that needs to happen. You want me to remark on that at all? Or do you

355
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,000
want me to just do it internally? No. Yeah, just internally. In fact, most of this

356
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,680
is your relationship to what's happening internally to you. And I'll guide you about when

357
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:23,440
to report to me. I'll just follow your lead. Yeah, so you check in and you're just noticing

358
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,600
right now. So one of the things that I like to do to get centered is I like to imagine that

359
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,640
my ears are like my eyes. And so as I take a deep breath,

360
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,840
just a cleansing sort of deep breath, I bring my attention to my ears and to the soundscape around

361
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,880
and John, I want you to just imagine that the soundscape is much like looking at a sunset or

362
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,880
a painting that you're picking up the colors and the details.

363
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:13,760
You may notice things outside of your office or cars or planes, or you may just notice silence.

364
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,400
And I'm going to ask you a trick question.

365
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:27,680
Um, focus on one of the noises, one of the objects that's moving through space and time around you,

366
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,280
and ask yourself the question, is that thing that I hear right or wrong?

367
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:42,720
And of course, it's neither right nor wrong. Is it good or bad? It's neither good nor bad,

368
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,720
it's just there. And the spirit that we're looking for is a spirit of observation, just noticing.

369
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,440
We're going to bring that same attention to your inner world now.

370
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,880
And I want you to just take a moment to notice what you notice.

371
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,280
Uh, parts may be up and about.

372
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:23,280
And parts communicate visually, images, memories, scenes. They communicate in the body with sensations,

373
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
emotions, and they communicate with words.

374
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,600
And then you may experience right away the presence of parts.

375
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,600
And I just want you before we move anywhere to just notice them and take a deep breath as if

376
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,800
you're breathing for the whole system, like a little bit of a gift.

377
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:53,600
And in a gentle inner voice, and if you'd like to place your hand on your chest,

378
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,920
I always enjoy using touch as a way of communicating, but you don't have to.

379
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,240
Allow your hand to be a symbol that says to them that you're here.

380
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,200
And in an inner voice, you can even say the words, I'm here.

381
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm present. My hand is a symbol that I'm not going anywhere.

382
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:27,920
This is the attachment frame that you're available and you're present to all the parts that want to come.

383
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,920
And just notice how that feels before we go any further.

384
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,000
And I'm going to check in with you now and you can leave your eyes closed and your hands

385
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,280
where they are, or you can move and adjust. But just tell me a little bit about what you're experiencing.

386
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,600
I'm experiencing a presence that's very familiar.

387
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,320
It's the yeah, yeah guy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is all bullshit.

388
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,200
Yeah, you know, it's just going to be over soon. This is just a waste of time.

389
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:14,880
That that that voice that voice and trying to not be put off by its arrogance.

390
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,720
I'm trying to remain open to it.

391
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,680
And there may be an even another part that's put off by its arrogance.

392
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,720
I'm trying to just hold that aside for now. Let's ask it.

393
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,680
Just wait possible. I want to hear it. I want to hear more of this. Yeah, yeah, guy.

394
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,600
Wonderful, John. I can tell that you've practiced.

395
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,720
I have a yeah, yeah, guy too. And he's got a foot on the break.

396
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,560
And then there's another part it sounds like that has a foot on the gas.

397
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:00,880
And let me just suggest that we turn from the yeah, yeah, yeah guy for a moment

398
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,320
to the part that is a little frustrated with him. Of course.

399
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,840
Can we do that? Can you turn your attention here? And it helps. I was going to ask. It's over here.

400
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:19,440
But I can sort of feel me. I need the gesture, but I can feel me bringing it sort of center stage.

401
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,240
Wonderful. Now, just take a moment slowly to be with that part.

402
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,240
And the first question I want to ask you, as you notice it, is how do you feel towards it?

403
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,600
Do I feel?

404
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah, I feel it. Oh, there's kind of a blending. It's angry at arrogance. I can't tell that anger

405
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,120
is the parts anger or my anger at the park.

406
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,920
Perfect. So I want you to ask the angry part of you to just take one step back so you can

407
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:59,680
enter into dialogue with it. Is it willing to do that? Yes. It's going to step sort of over here.

408
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:07,120
It's not going to go far. It wants to watch. But it's going to yeah. It's it's giving me

409
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:16,080
a pro temp opportunity. I'll give you a bit of time. Before we pivot, I want you to say thank

410
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:24,880
you to that part. We want to stay with it. And before we leave it, I want you now to just ask

411
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:32,880
it a question of how is it here to help you? What is its job? And just notice what it says.

412
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:40,160
Don't analyze. Just listen. Yeah, it says I'm here to prevent you from

413
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,840
fucking up because of your arrogance.

414
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,840
Thank you. Yeah.

415
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:57,520
Would it be willing to soften with you if it knows that you're going to turn and deal with

416
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,400
that part so that it doesn't have to?

417
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,960
Would it be willing to trust a little bit? It's there's hesitancy.

418
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,920
But you know, does it make sense to you that it would be hesitant, John?

419
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:23,120
Yeah. Yeah, it does because there's this part here feels

420
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:32,400
something tremendous about around arrogance. And this part is saying, you know, that tremendous,

421
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:40,560
that takes you got to be careful about that. And you got to be very hard and fast reactive.

422
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,600
That's what the anger is for. React hard and fast because this is big, big, big. So that's why it's

423
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:55,440
like that. But it's it's there's a little bit of I'll give you a bit of time with this. That's

424
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:03,360
all I can get. Excellent. So thank you. Let's let's make sure we just say thank you. And I would

425
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:09,520
like to I'll let that part know if I could speak to it. I would say that that's all we need is a

426
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:17,840
little bit of space. And that I invite it to watch. And I can hear very clearly how important

427
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:29,520
its role is for protecting John. And if it could just agree to not flood you. For when we're trying

428
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,800
this, I would like to try an agreement that if it needs to get your attention, it would just ask

429
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,480
and not flood you while we're trying. Is that okay? Yeah, that's okay. It's as long as yeah,

430
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,840
as long as I keep my promise. It's still there's doubt, but there's willing there's a bit. Yeah,

431
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:53,920
of course. Of course, there's doubt. How could there not be? Right. So thank you. I want you to pivot

432
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:01,280
your attention back to the yeah, yeah, yeah part now. And I want you very right off the bat to just

433
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:08,800
notice how you feel towards farther away now. Yeah, so you notice a little more distance. And he's

434
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,800
sort of over here, more on the periphery. If I turn to him, he moves a little closer. But

435
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:23,920
yeah, he's sort of there now. He I don't know, he doesn't seem quite as powerful.

436
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:33,520
Yeah, so he's his intensity is coming out a bit. He's he's been de-escalated a bit just

437
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,440
just by having some space here. Yeah, I'm now more open to this me.

438
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:48,480
Yeah, good. Yeah, I do. Yes. Yeah. So could you stay with him? Yeah, yeah, sure. And

439
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,000
and bring some curiosity here, John. I want to listen to him and I want to understand

440
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:03,360
what it is he's worried about. Could you just ask him in here? That's easy. He's the yeah, yeah,

441
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:09,200
because right, he wants to dampen things down so we don't have to have all the he wants to make

442
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,840
things boring. So I don't have all the intense emotion of this other stuff. He calls it this

443
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:21,120
other ship. He's a little bit still. So he's yeah, well, I like him. He's salty. And he's direct.

444
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:27,440
And he's saying he's saying that he's essentially his job is to protect you from being flooded

445
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,360
by all this intense shit. This stuff. That's what he that's what he means. That's what he

446
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:41,280
means by bullshit. He means anything that triggers this in some way. Oh, this is great, John.

447
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,720
Can I what I want you to do is kind of like a therapist, reflect that back to him and just

448
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,520
say, do I have it right in your inner voice? Yeah, yeah, you know, yeah, yep, you got it.

449
00:52:54,560 --> 00:53:00,160
Yeah. Okay. Good. How are you feeling towards him now? Kind of fun.

450
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:08,960
Yeah. Uh huh. You appreciate it, right? I do. Yeah. I used to get annoyed with him because I

451
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,480
felt he was just trivial trivializing things that were important. Oh, he didn't like it when I brought

452
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:25,840
that up. So now I'm, oh, I want to apologize to him. I want you in your inner voice to notice that

453
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:34,080
you have some sadness and that you feel for him and let him know as you apologize, let him know

454
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:40,240
what you feel towards him. Yeah, I'm just letting him know that I didn't treat him fairly. I'm sorry

455
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:48,720
for that. Yeah. He, uh, and how doing something important. Now I feel, I feel that I feel a little

456
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:57,680
bit of, I feel regret and a little bit of grief. Yeah. Yeah. Let him know. I am, I am. Yeah.

457
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:08,320
Yeah. He softens with that. It's like, almost like my grief is a water that's softening things

458
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,800
between us.

459
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,160
I'm going to share something I'd love to hear his response to this.

460
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,440
He hasn't felt an emotional bond with you

461
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,840
in a long time. And to know that his pain affects you and you feel pain

462
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:39,520
really feels reassuring and comforting to him. Yeah, that lands. There's, yeah, he feels

463
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,120
more trusting is all I'm getting. I can't make it clearer than that. That's right. Yeah. I think

464
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:54,320
the relationship between the two of you is healing a little bit at that moment where I realized

465
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,600
and it brought up genuine regret, even grief. That was completely unexpected.

466
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:10,720
Yeah. This is the, the relational component of IFS happening. It's very real. It's very real.

467
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,280
And it is embodied and you felt an emotion and you feeling that emotion for him.

468
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:25,360
He felt that. And the connection deepened and both of your bodies relaxed. I could see that.

469
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:31,600
Yeah. It's interesting. He, this is the part where I was talking to you about, about, I don't mean

470
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,920
it abstractly. There's, there's a capacity for self reflection. He's appreciating.

471
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,200
Oh, lovely. He's appreciating the capacity for self reflection.

472
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:49,040
Yeah. He's sort of, he's, so he's a little bit sorry too.

473
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:56,000
Hmm. Yeah, I see expressing that. Yeah, that's,

474
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,640
um, this is, we're hugging each other.

475
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,880
Hmm.

476
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,520
It's beautiful John.

477
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,400
Just telling that I'm, I'm telling him I really care for him.

478
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,560
Yeah. That's really beautiful.

479
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:34,880
He's wrestling with something. There's strong emotion coming up between us and

480
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,160
his grammar, if I can use that language is to try and resist strong emotion. So he's struggling.

481
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,040
Yeah. I'm just, I'm not, I'm just trying to just be with him like you are with a friend who's going

482
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,720
through something. I get the struggle.

483
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,400
Yeah.

484
00:56:52,400 --> 00:57:02,080
Yeah.

485
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,560
I don't want to impinge because I feel like a lot is happening.

486
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:21,200
Well, he's going through a lot. He's like metabolizing. There's this,

487
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,640
this is this call to integrity. Like it's when the part,

488
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:34,640
yeah. Yeah. I want to invite you to just stay with him in whatever way you can,

489
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,280
whether that's visually staying close to him.

490
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,520
Yeah. We're just close and he knows that he's allowed to do this.

491
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:54,720
Good. So there are a couple of questions that you don't have to answer because there's a

492
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,320
connection that's happening that's more important, but you could ask him what he needs from you

493
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,280
and see what he says.

494
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,720
I know it's just stay with him. He says, just be with me.

495
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,200
Good.

496
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,080
Just be with me.

497
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,360
Do you feel you can do that?

498
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:21,760
Yeah. I mean, it's tricky because I'm finding it hard to find the point of discernment between

499
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,160
empathizing with his pain and bleeding into it.

500
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,960
So a little trouble with the boundary?

501
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:40,240
I'm afraid that I'm owning something that belongs to him or vice versa.

502
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:48,720
So, perfect, John. We're not going to leave him. He can stay connected to you,

503
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,160
even if it's just like holding a hand or just staying right by.

504
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,960
But I'd like you to pivot your attention from him to the part of you that's scared

505
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,040
right now. Scared that you're doing it wrong or scared that you're blending.

506
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,920
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,960
Yeah. That's rational man.

508
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:09,920
Yeah.

509
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,200
So rational man. Now, same thing as before.

510
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:20,640
Ask him to take one step back so you can dialogue with him and then take a moment to just take him

511
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:32,960
in and observe him. What does he want you to see? Just ask him what would you like me to witness

512
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,160
and see what he does?

513
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,640
Well, his initial response is there's not enough theory here.

514
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,920
That's what he initially says, right?

515
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,800
Of course. Of course. So theory is the way he keeps you safe.

516
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,240
It's not enough theory here. This is going off in all these directions.

517
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,240
And he's starting to do this very analytically. He's starting to list.

518
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,920
Yeah. So how do you feel towards this part?

519
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,120
I have a friendly relationship with him. That's why when he came up, it was funny.

520
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:12,320
He does a lot of good work for me. And I'm appreciative. I owe part of my job to him,

521
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:21,920
right? If he doesn't come into play, I can't do the work I do. So I like him. We like each other.

522
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,280
But he, yeah. But like I said, he's a little...

523
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:27,760
Can you...

524
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:38,080
I love the relationship you have and you feel a lot of self-energy with him.

525
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:44,000
It's a very, very good relationship. So I think he's just perhaps wanting to

526
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,440
touch base and check in with you. Can you ask him if he needs anything from you?

527
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,000
No. He just said what Seth said.

528
01:00:52,160 --> 01:01:00,640
Okay. Great. I love his efficiency. Okay. So if it's okay with him, then we'll turn back to...

529
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,080
And now I'm not afraid either.

530
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,240
That's the part we were with. Good.

531
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,480
There's just... I'm still holding on to him over here. There's still this very localized though,

532
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:17,920
sort of processing, metabolizing, sort of grief, pain, reunion. That's still running over here.

533
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,240
That's interesting. It almost has a life of its own over here.

534
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,240
Yeah. The relationship continues even if you're not paying attention to it.

535
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,080
That's a great observation, John. So let's check in with him.

536
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,640
And is there anything he wants you to witness now?

537
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:44,400
He's crying. But he's telling me it's good. It's good. He's actually telling me not to get upset.

538
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,960
Which is interesting.

539
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,000
He's still trying to take care of you.

540
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,880
Yeah. He is. He still cares about me. And that's nice. And I tell him I really get the struggle

541
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,720
he's in. This is the core of who and what he is. His job. It's really clear. His job is to

542
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:10,480
prevent intense emotion, yet he needs to connect with me. And that has intense emotion attached

543
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,880
to it. And so he's like, I'm telling you. I'm telling him. Sorry, I switched to talking to

544
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:24,160
him directly. I get it. I really get it. I get what you're wrestling with. And I'm here. I get it.

545
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,200
So good, John. So good.

546
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:48,640
I'm going to just play a hunch and ask a question. And it could very well be no.

547
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:59,600
But would he be interested in going with you to a safe, secure, different place inside of you?

548
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,920
Yeah, he doesn't want to do that.

549
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,400
He wants to stay where he is. No problem.

550
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,520
He's on the edge of what he can handle.

551
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:20,400
Perfect. So I want to let him know, and you, that we are going to respect his boundaries.

552
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,240
And when he feels like he's at a point of saying, stop, that is totally what we're going to do.

553
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,840
All right. I've let him know.

554
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:42,720
Okay. And I'm just going to hold this space with you and allow that to take whatever course it wants

555
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,680
to take inside.

556
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,080
He's tired.

557
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:05,360
He's processing and bound up. He's tired and got that sense until now. He's really tired.

558
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:17,280
I find myself imagining that he's been great. He wants me to sit down too,

559
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,680
so I'm sitting down with him. He's really tired.

560
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,040
Does it make sense to you that he's tired?

561
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:31,600
Yeah. He's just been carrying this for a long time and then confronting with this on top of it,

562
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:39,360
sort of this self-reflective awareness. It's exhausted, really tired.

563
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,320
His job has been exhausting. His job has been exhausting, and he's telling me he's not upset

564
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:53,920
about it, but getting him to connecting with him is also exhausting. He wants it, but it's exhausting.

565
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,000
So he's been in a bit of a double bind.

566
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:08,960
That's exactly it. Boy, that landed, and he feels like he's struggling. He's been struggling against

567
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,960
that. That makes sense.

568
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,920
Yeah. There's a little bit. I can hear a little bit of intensity in there.

569
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:16,800
His voice.

570
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,200
Powerful for him to have that.

571
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,560
There's this image of almost like, I can't quite draw it with my hands, but there's this

572
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:35,040
rope, this twisting upon itself rope thing that's binding him and I and himself.

573
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,040
He's trying to articulate it with an image.

574
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,960
That double bind is exactly right.

575
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,760
Good.

576
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,240
Oh, I feel a lot of compassion for him right now.

577
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,200
He's smiling. What's coming up? When I said that, he smiled.

578
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,720
Oh, some of the negative affect is calming a little bit.

579
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:21,760
Yeah, it continues to calm.

580
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,200
Sort of settling in. He just wants to be with me, very calm and just be with me without all that

581
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,400
without all that craziness.

582
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:49,040
What I'm getting, John, is that maybe for the first time, it feels safe for him to be connected

583
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:54,000
with you and to not be scared of getting flooded by all the intense stuff.

584
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:03,520
Yeah, there's a bit of a sense of confidence. You said that it was the negative affect grows

585
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:17,440
a little bit, but it didn't go. It just went and it sort of hit that confidence that shared faith.

586
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,040
He likes that. He likes me saying that.

587
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:38,960
One of the things that is done in the IFS world is to, if possible, if he wants to,

588
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:50,720
where there was all that angst and fear and intensity, a space might clear in him

589
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,720
where he could take in calmness and confidence

590
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,120
and breathe that in and feel it. He wants to get up and move around a little bit.

591
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,880
Wonderful. He's sort of dancing.

592
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,280
It still hurts a little, but he's dancing.

593
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:26,400
Breathing in creativity and expression. He's returning.

594
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,720
He wonders what's next.

595
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:38,240
He's returning to play. Now that he's free of the job he wasn't supposed to have,

596
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:49,840
he can become embodied as a natural being that has its own organic nuclear agenda.

597
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:51,920
What does he want?

598
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,960
Well, I had to hold Rational Man off for a sec. He came in.

599
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,480
Sorry. I think I brought him in.

600
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,600
This needs a label. This needs a name. We've got to put some concepts on this.

601
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:06,960
I'll give you time later.

602
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,840
That's exactly right. He's going to come and get his turn in a minute.

603
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:23,200
He did. Like I said, he and I have a very good working relationship.

604
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,760
When he stepped back, again, even more calmness here,

605
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,280
he's considering, I don't know how to put this, so this isn't quite right, but

606
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,600
he's considering just putting down his job.

607
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,400
He's really open question. Is that possible?

608
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:51,840
Yeah.

609
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,480
So he's contemplating it.

610
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,400
I said, I think it is. I'd like to help.

611
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:15,280
Yeah, he's really, he's in that state of, huh, that's what he keeps sort of doing,

612
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,880
huh, maybe, and he's still dancing around too.

613
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,080
He dances and he pauses and he does that, huh, he does that, huh.

614
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,280
He's feeling into it.

615
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,080
Yeah, he doesn't want to rush, that's for sure.

616
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,160
Well, that makes sense to me.

617
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,680
Yeah, me too. Me too.

618
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,280
Yeah.

619
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:57,920
I just, you wanted me to forgive him. I do it. Get it.

620
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,080
Yeah. Okay.

621
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,120
Okay.

622
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,440
He really needed to hear that.

623
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:53,280
Yeah, as he's considering the possibility, he's sort of sharing with me, see all the places in your

624
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,680
life where I was this trivializing thing.

625
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:07,760
He wants to make sure that I'm fully appreciating his job, what he's been doing.

626
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,480
And he's wondering if I, yep, that's so important.

627
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,440
He's wondering if I can

628
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,080
really accept that and forgive him to that scale.

629
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,880
Yeah, I really can get it.

630
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:44,880
Well, he believes me, but he's still not fully settled.

631
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,480
Now he's sitting down again. He wants to sit with all of this.

632
01:12:53,920 --> 01:13:04,960
Are we getting a thing from him? That's enough for me. I don't want to do any more.

633
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,200
Yeah.

634
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:14,960
Well, he has done an amazing amount of work right now. Yeah, I mean, really amazing.

635
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:25,520
Um, this is a point where we can just remind him that you're not going anywhere.

636
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,400
And that he can reach you when it's on the door.

637
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:37,280
That's it. And we want to make sure we're clear about how we can connect with you if you need to.

638
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,400
Through your body, through emotion, but through words would be great too.

639
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,280
Yeah, I'm letting him know.

640
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:49,840
Good.

641
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,120
So he's asking if I can just leave that little bit of energy running for him

642
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,920
so he can keep processing it. I said, that's fine.

643
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:10,320
Wonderful. And just, um, if it feels right to you, John, you could let him know that you'll

644
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,960
check back in with him later. I will. I'll check back in with you.

645
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,000
Okay.

646
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:15,920
You're doing.

647
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:24,160
And, um, you can say your goodbyes in whatever way you want to. And then when you're ready, come on back here.

648
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:43,120
There's, well, I've always found it powerful. That was very powerful. It, uh,

649
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,400
your expertise, your virtuosity was helpful. You often said something that

650
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,600
landed just beyond where I was, but landed well. And that was very helpful.

651
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:06,640
Good. It was pretty easy on my side too. In fact, the hardest part was just restraining myself,

652
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:13,680
because the work was going so quickly. And your system, I would say your system was

653
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,760
very ready to do that. So at the very end,

654
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,280
I had a sense of Hermes, almost like a translucent presence,

655
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,160
surrounding the whole thing, sort of saying, well done.

656
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,240
That was unexpected too. That just came.

657
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:36,800
Yeah.

658
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:48,640
John, thank you for your trust and, um, for allowing me to be with you.

659
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,040
Thank you.

660
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:56,480
Um, I'd like to take the opportunity to let rational man have his, uh, his time,

661
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,960
because there is a lot of sense making that could be powerful here.

662
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,840
But I don't want to do that at the expense of, um, the connection that you just established,

663
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,280
and the experience you're having in your body right now.

664
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,880
So maybe we start with just checking in on how you feel.

665
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:23,280
So I, really, really good. And then right here, this little tiny sort of running that's happening,

666
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,640
and it's him, uh, it's not, it's not pleasant, but it's not distressing to me because,

667
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:33,600
yeah, there's a moment of sort of friendship there. I could feel this is just the metabolizing

668
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,320
going on. Just metabolizing. You just keep checking in with me. And yep, I will. I will.

669
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,240
Uh-huh. That's great. That's great. It's, um,

670
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:53,840
I love your interception. So, um, well, you, you have, uh, really developed your ability to

671
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,120
stay relational and dialogical and present. Learned it from,

672
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,440
and embodied. Learned it from socrates, so.

673
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,840
Pretty good teacher.

674
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,960
Um, so I want to, um, take the risk and you tell me and interrupt me at any point if it

675
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:21,200
feels like, um, it's not going intuitively where you would like to be. Um, but I'd like to draw some

676
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:26,960
things out, uh, that we've been talking about, um, that, that I just witnessed, I think.

677
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:37,280
So the first thing I want to do is say that, um, uh, we encountered, uh, a couple of different

678
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:46,720
parts in there. Um, a rational man clearly is a manager, um, who is in charge of keeping things

679
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:56,400
safe. Um, and we also had this frustrated part that I think is a manager that, uh, seems to be, um,

680
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:05,760
also charged with keeping things safe. Um, and I think, I think we had a bit of a firefighter

681
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:14,080
there in the, uh, the bullshit detector who, um, both was trying to keep, in a manager way,

682
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:20,880
trying to keep you from being flooded, but also responding to the flood when it would happen

683
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:27,760
by kind of trying to cut it off and call it out. Um, and what happened is as, as you brought

684
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:32,960
what Schwarz calls self energy, which we, we first had to clear other problems, right?

685
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:40,000
We had to, we had to get them to give you space so that you could be with him. And people will

686
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,880
have noticed as soon as they gave space, we didn't have to do anything. You turned back

687
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,760
and the relationship field had changed. He wasn't flooding you and super close. He was a little

688
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:59,120
further. Your system was deactivated and you were present and curious. And the relationship

689
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:05,440
dynamics just took hold. And I would say this is where, from my perspective as an EFT therapist

690
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:12,640
and an attachment based psychotherapist, we watched a beautiful scene of attachment unfold

691
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:21,440
where it was nervous system to nervous system. And so what I was trying to draw out was that

692
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:28,560
connection that you felt emotionally to him. And I wanted him to see it and feel that your system

693
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:36,720
was connected to his. He felt pain. You felt sad about it. Yeah. And there's a natural. So

694
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:42,400
when we work with couples, primary affect, when it comes up, when I see my partner who I love and

695
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,640
my whole world depends on hurting, some kind of fear comes up in me and I want to make it better.

696
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:55,600
And I feel sad that they're in pain. That is trustworthy because that can't lie. That can't

697
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:03,120
be untrue. You can't have those automatic responses be feigned. And so that gave him an

698
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:08,400
opportunity to experience something that is truly trustworthy between the two of you.

699
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:20,560
And he began to soften. And as he softened, we had grief. But we also had the possibility of

700
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:26,960
something new emerging. And I agree with everything you said. But there's that there was and I wasn't

701
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:35,040
imposing it. There's that there's a Socratic aspect of him coming to try to live by the principle.

702
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:40,160
Like that's when he got into the double bind. That's a Socratic Aporia. Right. And he got into

703
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:48,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, there was a ah, right. And that was that was I thought, I thought really important

704
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:54,960
too. And the part of me that didn't want to do to I like part of what I've been learning in my

705
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,160
practice is to stay with Aporia rather than try to and that's rational man coming in to try let's

706
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,640
get this come on. Like, and no, let's hold that back. Stay with the Aporia really stay with the

707
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,240
Aporia. Give it some autonomy, let it unfold as it needs to.

708
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:18,160
Or in this case, what I heard was he began to try to work with a symbol. Yes. Yes. Yes.

709
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:26,000
And that something needed to loosen and and kind of become

710
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,840
untied. I think he came to the possibility that emotions

711
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:39,200
are not inherently dangerous. It was that's that kind of realization and that he actually wanted

712
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:46,080
an emotional connection with me. And he was really I mean, yeah, so that is

713
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:53,120
No, no, no, please. For me, that was that was like that was a real that felt like a profound moment

714
01:21:53,120 --> 01:22:00,800
because it was him like getting it. Like he was like it's like the existential confront.

715
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:07,360
He was confronted by, you know, a kind of inner contradiction. Like, no, no, I want an emotion

716
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:14,880
and it's not so it can't be that they're inherently bad. But my job is to dampen down

717
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:24,640
emotion. And that was the knot. And I felt that that and I found I'm, I'm, I'm surmising because

718
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,840
now we're doing theoretical reflection that my practice in dialectic of theologos of being

719
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,880
apophatic and staying with Aporia came in to help me there because it helped me also keep

720
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,480
rational man over there. And it helped me, okay, you need to I can't unravel this for you.

721
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:46,400
Right. But I can be here with you and say I'm going to support you and empathize with you as

722
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:50,080
you try to do, even as I'm saying that right now, this is getting calmer.

723
01:22:51,040 --> 01:23:02,720
So in IFS, we'd say that's self-energy. That compassion, curiosity, courage, creativity,

724
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,440
calmness connected. That's the socratic spirit for me.

725
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:12,960
Well, and there are five, I always forget there are five P's as well as the eight C's. And I wrote

726
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:22,640
them down here. Patience, perspective, which I think is a lot of this, presence, persistence,

727
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:31,760
no, no, no, rational man, you know, playfulness. This is all, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think this

728
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,760
self-energy can be helped by people if they have a practice of internalizing a sage. I think that

729
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:46,240
would help concretize it so they can enact it better. So this is, this is the guide idea and

730
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:53,920
that your attachment with Hermes, not a coincidence that appears at the end as he is,

731
01:23:54,720 --> 01:24:00,960
he's blessed. Very much. That was, that's the word. And that's the word. Exactly.

732
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,840
I feel a bit of happy right now.

733
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:09,120
Lovely.

734
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,840
Can I just, one thing that I really want to kind of draw out here is we talked about parts having

735
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:29,360
attachment styles. And I heard, primarily I heard in it, an anxious attachment style that

736
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:39,600
and the, the, oh, oh, was his dropping into security. Maybe for the first time.

737
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,240
I love this. I love the IFF and the attachment. I mean the EFT and the attachment. That's, oh,

738
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:53,520
it's so good. But John, listen to this. This is the definition in my mind of secure attachment

739
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:58,160
is about the ability to process emotion. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's that emotion,

740
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:04,000
emotion is not a threat. It's data. Yeah, it's data. And you and he were learning to interpret

741
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,720
the data together. That it is not flooding, but it can be, I can actually feel it and use it

742
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:16,240
and symbolize it, feel it in the body, symbolize it in a way it can be understood,

743
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:22,640
be responded to, feel regulated, four steps to attach. That was beautiful. Feel it,

744
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:32,560
symbolize it often in language. Be responded to accurately in a way that works. Be soothed.

745
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:39,440
That repeated creates a secure attachment style. And that's what you were doing with it. Yeah.

746
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:48,480
He'd never done it, John. No, of course not. He'd never done it. Of course he had, right.

747
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:54,880
But you got, and we got to witness the transformation that like that kind of presence and love,

748
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,800
really. That brings sadness to me.

749
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,800
Did he never felt it? No. And we're, it's almost a sharing. I have,

750
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:16,160
I think my attachment style as John is one of anxious attachment. And that has caused me

751
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:23,280
a tremendous amount of loss and suffering and put relationships at risk. So that just came back to

752
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:35,200
me very powerfully. Of course. So I feel for him even more, but it brings up that sort of anxious

753
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:43,600
empathy around, yeah, I know how bad this could be. It also makes sense to me when you say that,

754
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:52,000
why he would be so curious and scared about your ability to forgive him. Exactly. That's exactly

755
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,600
right. That's exactly right. He knows it's cost you. Yeah.

756
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,280
Now that lands very deeply, very deeply right here.

757
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:09,680
But it's not his fault. No. Yeah, he gets that.

758
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:23,920
And this is why IFS represents one of the best technologies that we have in our endeavors

759
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:34,160
of dealing with the meeting crisis. And it's very exciting.

760
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,440
This idea of creating or not creating, sorry, accessing self-energy.

761
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:49,360
I use inventio. I use inventio, imaginal inventio. You're discovering and making,

762
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,440
and it's a mixture. It's inventio because it's transjective. It can't be either discovery or

763
01:27:53,440 --> 01:28:01,680
making. It has to be inventio and it's imaginal. And in your experience, we have an even fuller

764
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:10,320
demonstration with Hermes coming as a transjective object that he brings the eight C's and the five

765
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:17,760
P's into the system in a way that maybe you couldn't access before. And that's the larger

766
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:25,120
self, kind of the, he's creating this bridge. I was going to say, I didn't, I didn't, I make a

767
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:31,360
difference between asking something from him and invoking his presence. I didn't invoke his

768
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:36,960
presence because I wanted to, and so I didn't do that, but I asked for his help in the practice

769
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,920
that I could come into it as authentically as possible.

770
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:45,520
And you did? Yeah.

771
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,960
I experienced Hermes as holding space there. That's where he was. And that's where he was in

772
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,440
the final image. He's like, there's, I don't know why there's sort of a hillside behind,

773
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:05,200
and he's on like, and it's that translucent figure. Yeah, very much. I didn't, I, yeah,

774
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:10,160
I didn't get that until you said it, but the translucency was a way of presencing the

775
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:19,360
transjectivity. Excellent. Excellent observation set. Ah, I love that. I love that. Yeah. Yeah,

776
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:25,920
the psychopomp, the movement through that he embodies a kind of liminal transitionality.

777
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:31,360
What was wonderful about that presencing is often when I'm working with him, we have to sort of

778
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:37,120
scrape away automatic projections going on to him, given to me by my fundamentalist past.

779
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:42,000
That wasn't there at all. This is one of the, this was like pure presence, and it was quite

780
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,960
wonderful, quite wonderful, beautiful, even sublime.

781
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:58,320
I think I'd point out one other thing that is really important, and that is that there was

782
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:04,800
such a strong relational element to the work between you and I, as we did this, and that

783
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:13,840
that was not work that, you know, you were doing by yourself, but it was in dialogue going this way,

784
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:21,920
and going internal, and maybe going this way hermetically. And I think that creates

785
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,600
a picture of safety that we can reference when we, we talk about encountering the

786
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:34,880
numinous as a way of kind of accessing wisdom, that it is, it is connected in all these directions.

787
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:46,000
And that feels, it feels like the container, you know, that's needed. Yeah. Yeah. That's

788
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,120
landing very deeply for me. And for me, I see it as containers within containers. This is the

789
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:59,360
container. And then it sits into a larger 4e neoplatonic framework. And like, yeah, there's

790
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:04,880
there's these nestings. And but they're not ossified and hard. They're like, they're like

791
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,520
cellular membranes. So

792
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:20,160
I had one other question for you about how old was he? He was a 25 to 30 year old man.

793
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,960
Okay, interesting. He got a little bit younger as the practice went on.

794
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:37,200
I was wondering about that because he had exile qualities. And we haven't talked about

795
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:45,440
exiles, but he was clearly carrying a lot of pain and exhaustion, guilt and anger and sadness,

796
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:54,080
a lot of like, the anxious attachment stuff that he began to release in his way.

797
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:00,720
It was interesting. I kind of wanted to go that way as John. But no, that was not,

798
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,280
that wasn't going to happen. That was not going to happen. He was, that's not,

799
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:12,640
it was, he needed, he needed to dwell. That's the word I was looking for. He needed to dwell here

800
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:24,480
for a while. I mean, reminds me dwelling at home. He needed to feel at home. Yeah.

801
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:34,720
Well, I know like 1115 was our hard stop or 1215 year time. You normally give me the last word,

802
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:40,000
but I'm wondering if you would like it. Yeah, let's break with that tradition just for this one

803
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,800
time. First of all, thank you for that. And I think the integrity of the practice as a container

804
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:56,480
and as a vehicle is both a container and a vehicle. I think that was apparent. It was

805
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:04,640
spontaneously there. I didn't have to force it. It had, it was Dow. It wasn't, right? And

806
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:11,120
it's important to,

807
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:22,880
important to share this responsibly. I agree with you. And all these

808
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:29,040
dialogical practices, I think, well, we'll talk about, I want to talk about them now.

809
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:36,800
I want to talk about the next one. What does that mean? Because I think they push on deeper frameworks

810
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:41,760
and, right? That's why I talked about the 4E and the cognitive, 40 cognitive science and

811
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:48,880
neoplatism because we're really challenging the buffered self. And I think, I think, and I don't

812
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:53,520
know how this works. So this is a question. I don't, I want to know how these, I'll use

813
01:33:54,480 --> 01:34:00,480
a, a convoluted thing. I don't know how these cultural spirits interact with these psychological

814
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:08,000
parts. Like we've got inculturation towards the buffered self and we get social reinforcement

815
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,840
and salience incentivizing around it. And that's a deeply internalized machine that it's almost

816
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:21,040
transparent. And I think in practice, we, we press up against that when we're doing these

817
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:29,600
kinds of practices. But for me, I feel especially because I bring this whole framework of reflectively

818
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:37,520
trying to philosophically trying to challenge the monadic, monophasic, monological, monostage self

819
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:46,640
that it's, it's, it's very amplified for me. That sense, that deeper sense of what is it like?

820
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:53,920
And that didn't come up here because there was enough. But it's coming up now as I step back

821
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,120
from it. It's like, as it's percolating through my psyche, it's like, yeah, but

822
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:04,320
like, what is it to challenge that cultural spirit and challenge it in a way that integrates with

823
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,520
what's happening with these psychological parts? That's a question that I have.

824
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:20,640
So what I'd reflect is I feel like rational man. And is now, you know, we talk about, I think the

825
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:31,120
theme for today was that the imaginal is crucial to being rational. And he's picking it up. I feel

826
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:39,600
like this, this practice you just engaged in has clarified something for him that he now has

827
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,720
sharper questions. I think that's exactly right. I think that's exactly right.

828
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:51,200
Okay, Mike. Yeah, that's something. Thank you for all of this. And we'll set up another,

829
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:58,000
another episode because I do want to explore some of these themes around danger and framework

830
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and cultural spirit versus psychological part. If I could just coin those terms as

831
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,880
the whole two things conceptually different for a while. Oh, yeah. And so I invite you to come back

832
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:16,960
for a fourth episode. Well, I tell you, yeah, I thank you. And I would love to.

833
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:26,400
It's, it's wonderful to dialogue with you. And it's a gift. And I'm very excited if you choose

834
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:37,280
to share it. I'm going to upload this. Wonderful. I know this may seem like a very shame less or

835
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:45,520
shameful plug. But because the spirit of this is to, you know, promote these practices,

836
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:53,600
we are going to offer the attachment workshop and the IFS workshop again through the foundation.

837
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:59,680
Coming up in April and May. Yeah, please. Everybody, you see what this can do. Okay. So,

838
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:06,080
you know, you've got an amazing opportunity with Seth. Please make use of it. I'm going to end

839
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:13,680
the recording here, Seth. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jeff.
