Checking Olympia Sophie/Social media makes us unsocial⧸ HERE'S WHY.txt
 Olympia, with a background in cognitive neuroscience and art history, begins a video discussing the paradox of social media—how it has ironically made us less social. She points out the irony of people being on their phones during shared experiences like watching a movie or attending an event, which she finds soul-throwing. She emphasizes that social media is designed to be addictive and suggests watching "The Social Dilemma" for insights into this addiction.

Olympia argues that while social media was initially intended to make the world feel smaller and facilitate global connections, it has led many to compare their lives unfavorably to the curated highlights of others' lives. She admits to having emerged from the social media cave only recently and acknowledges her own struggles with comparing her work on platforms like Instagram and YouTube to that of others.

She cites a chilling prediction by a researcher who suggests that in the next decade, young people might be more adept at using emojis to express emotions than actually displaying them physically. This underscores the concern that social media is impacting our ability to connect and communicate on a human level.

Olympia introduces the concept of "comparison orientation," which describes the tendency to constantly compare one's life to others, leading to dissatisfaction as the comparison is always skewed in favor of someone else's seemingly more ideal life. She encourages viewers to reflect on their own social media usage and asks them to share in the comments what aspects of others' lives they find themselves comparing.

Finally, Olympia invites her audience to engage with the video by subscribing, ringing the bell for notifications, and sharing the content with others who may have become less social due to overuse of social media platforms. She concludes by reminding viewers to take a moment to be present with their own lives before diving into someone else's online presence.
