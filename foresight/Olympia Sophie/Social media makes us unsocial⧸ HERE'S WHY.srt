00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,320
We are currently experiencing a pandemic, but never before have we had such a loneliness epidemic.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,680
It seems that we've forgotten the social part in the social media, so I want to do a video about

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,560
how social media has made us more unsocial. And it seems that the more platforms that come out,

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,800
the more types of social media, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, the more lonelier we become,

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,200
the more we immerse ourselves in a person's highlights, literally on Instagram, a person's

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,080
feed, a person's life, the more we start despairing and comparing. So this video is going to talk about

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,400
why social media makes us unsocial, a few studies behind how research has observed this phenomenon

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,480
and to back it up, but also just for you guys to get a harsh truth time reality check of what your

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,320
daily life is. If you have no idea who I am, my name is Olympia. I have a degree in cognitive

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,760
neuroscience and art history. And what I like to do, I like to dissect that pretty little brain of yours

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,360
to see what makes you tick, but also what makes you talk. So make sure to smash that subscribe

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,440
button and ring that bell for your weekly Thursday videos. And let's start. So one thing I want to

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,520
put out there that I despise, it literally, I feel my soul is throwing up is when I see people

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,880
that are in a social setting and are supposed to be together, such as watching a movie, eating a

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,400
restaurant, just eating in general with someone next to you, or when you're at some kind of event,

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,040
like a concert or celebrating someone's birthday party, and people have their phone out. Let me

17
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,080
know in the comments below if this has happened to you. I've been watching a movie with like five

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,080
people and each of those five people were on their phones. And I'm watching the movie and I'm

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,920
thinking like, what the heck, you guys? Like I thought like this was something that we all chose

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,200
to watch together and everyone's like scrolling through their feet. Now, if you haven't watched

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,120
the social dilemma on Netflix, I highly recommend it because social media is basically a type of

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,000
addiction. And the more, like I said, the more platforms that come out, the more we get addicted.

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,600
So I bet if I asked one of those five people what the hell you're doing,

24
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,400
they wouldn't actually register the fact that they had opened their phone and they were looking. It's

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,360
just a habit because we are creatures of habits. Now, don't get me wrong. During my teenage years,

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,840
I also engaged in electronic social media. I guess we didn't have social media then, but I had a

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,720
Game Boy, for example, back in the day when it was politically correct to have a Game Boy, even

28
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,720
though later on Game Girl came out. But I would also be on this device while we were having family

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,760
time. But the more the internet, the more the technology advances, the less social we're becoming.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,240
The thing though is my little 90 people, my 90 babies out there, with the Game Boy, for example,

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,240
we didn't have anything to compare ourselves to. Aside from maybe like how far in the game we are,

32
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,720
we weren't looking at other people's lives. We were just kind of taking a break from whatever

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,120
was going on out here and was focusing on a game here. And this is why I believe that watching

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,320
social dilemma is so important because it literally explains to you how social media

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,320
is designed to keep you addicted on the application. Each bell that rings, each color that application

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:41,360
is, has been carefully selected based on what brings in the human psychology. Like the notifications

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,280
you have on WhatsApp or Instagram, they're red. Red means alert. Red means look. It's something

38
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,440
that brings your attention. So I feel that a lot of people are forgetting the social part of social

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,240
media. The reason why social media was invented innocently enough was that they wanted to make

40
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,200
the world feel smaller. We have the entire globe at our fingertips, literally. We can connect with

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,880
people instantly from across the world. But somehow we got lost in this and we started to, instead of

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:24,320
trying to connect our own life, we started comparing to other people's lives. Now I personally

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,160
emerged from the social media cave about two years ago. And I am before that, I didn't have a Facebook,

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,040
I didn't have an Instagram, but I realized that if I want to do what I want to do, which is help you

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,120
guys mind shift your mindset, I focus a lot on emotional abuse, but basically help you get the

46
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,080
life you want and deserve, I wouldn't be able to do that without the social part, which is my Instagram,

47
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,440
my YouTube. So me, it's focusing on connection. But even myself, like I get into, I've said this

48
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,680
in my compare and despair videos and how to stop comparing yourself to others, even though I personally

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,080
came late in the game and I tried to do the social part of it, I even start comparing myself. I'll

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
look at other people's Instagram feeds, I'll look at other people's vanity metrics, I'll look at other

51
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,840
YouTube videos about the same subjects, how I delivered, how they delivered. So the more we

52
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,680
immerse ourselves in the social media world, the farther away we come from the physical world.

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,200
Now, one phrase that blew my mind, and let me know if this phrase hits a spot with you,

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,160
was from this researcher, I can't remember her name, I'll try to link the article below.

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,960
But she said, in the next decade, we may see more young people that are able to put the

56
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,440
exact emoji for a situation, but not the right facial expression. Can you imagine,

57
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,520
can you fathom how terrifying that is? Think about it, when you're on social media,

58
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,400
when somebody says something funny or you are writing and you're trying to convey emotion,

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,320
your mind right now is able to pick an emoji that doesn't even look like a human and add some,

60
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't know, light to that sentence, convey some emotion. And research is now showing that

61
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,480
people are becoming less able to put the right facial expression and more able to put the right

62
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:26,480
emoji. This idea of comparing your social media to someone else's is called the comparison

63
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,840
orientation. And it has been coined by research as the comparison orientation. And it is also a

64
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,320
term before is compare and despair. But the comparison orientation is that you take on

65
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,200
another person's life and you constantly compare it to your own. I mean, we all have people that

66
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,680
we idolize, we all have people that we like, that we kind of want to be like them. But comparison

67
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,760
orientation takes it to another extent. Comparison orientation means that you are never satisfied

68
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,920
with the life you have, because the other person will always have a better life. They will have a

69
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,120
better house, a better husband, better kids, better job, more rich, all these stuff, all these

70
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
beautiful stuff. So let me know in the comments below. First of all, what are your favorite

71
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,280
social media platforms? What do you find yourself opening the first thing in the morning? I want

72
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,080
you guys to notice if you are one of those people that pick up their phone the moment they wake up.

73
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,680
And I would advise try and just sit five, 10 minutes before you immerse yourself in someone

74
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,920
else's life and just sit with your own life. And let me know in the comments below if you also

75
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,280
compare yourself to other people's media. And what exactly are you comparing? Now,

76
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,600
I hope you enjoyed this video. Make sure to smash the subscribe button somewhere here. Ring your bell

77
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,640

78
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,680
most importantly, guys, share this video with someone who's become more unsocial because of

79
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
social media. And that's it, folks.
