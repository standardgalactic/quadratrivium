240	8320	We are currently experiencing a pandemic, but never before have we had such a loneliness epidemic.
9600	15680	It seems that we've forgotten the social part in the social media, so I want to do a video about
15680	22560	how social media has made us more unsocial. And it seems that the more platforms that come out,
22560	28800	the more types of social media, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, the more lonelier we become,
28800	35200	the more we immerse ourselves in a person's highlights, literally on Instagram, a person's
35200	42080	feed, a person's life, the more we start despairing and comparing. So this video is going to talk about
42080	48400	why social media makes us unsocial, a few studies behind how research has observed this phenomenon
48400	54480	and to back it up, but also just for you guys to get a harsh truth time reality check of what your
54480	60320	daily life is. If you have no idea who I am, my name is Olympia. I have a degree in cognitive
60320	67760	neuroscience and art history. And what I like to do, I like to dissect that pretty little brain of yours
67760	73360	to see what makes you tick, but also what makes you talk. So make sure to smash that subscribe
73360	79440	button and ring that bell for your weekly Thursday videos. And let's start. So one thing I want to
79440	85520	put out there that I despise, it literally, I feel my soul is throwing up is when I see people
86160	92880	that are in a social setting and are supposed to be together, such as watching a movie, eating a
92880	98400	restaurant, just eating in general with someone next to you, or when you're at some kind of event,
98400	105040	like a concert or celebrating someone's birthday party, and people have their phone out. Let me
105120	110080	know in the comments below if this has happened to you. I've been watching a movie with like five
110080	116080	people and each of those five people were on their phones. And I'm watching the movie and I'm
116080	119920	thinking like, what the heck, you guys? Like I thought like this was something that we all chose
119920	125200	to watch together and everyone's like scrolling through their feet. Now, if you haven't watched
125200	131120	the social dilemma on Netflix, I highly recommend it because social media is basically a type of
131200	136000	addiction. And the more, like I said, the more platforms that come out, the more we get addicted.
136560	139600	So I bet if I asked one of those five people what the hell you're doing,
140320	144400	they wouldn't actually register the fact that they had opened their phone and they were looking. It's
144400	151360	just a habit because we are creatures of habits. Now, don't get me wrong. During my teenage years,
151360	157840	I also engaged in electronic social media. I guess we didn't have social media then, but I had a
157840	162720	Game Boy, for example, back in the day when it was politically correct to have a Game Boy, even
162720	170720	though later on Game Girl came out. But I would also be on this device while we were having family
170720	177760	time. But the more the internet, the more the technology advances, the less social we're becoming.
177760	184240	The thing though is my little 90 people, my 90 babies out there, with the Game Boy, for example,
184240	188240	we didn't have anything to compare ourselves to. Aside from maybe like how far in the game we are,
188800	192720	we weren't looking at other people's lives. We were just kind of taking a break from whatever
192720	199120	was going on out here and was focusing on a game here. And this is why I believe that watching
199120	204320	social dilemma is so important because it literally explains to you how social media
204320	212320	is designed to keep you addicted on the application. Each bell that rings, each color that application
212320	221360	is, has been carefully selected based on what brings in the human psychology. Like the notifications
221360	229280	you have on WhatsApp or Instagram, they're red. Red means alert. Red means look. It's something
229280	235440	that brings your attention. So I feel that a lot of people are forgetting the social part of social
235440	242240	media. The reason why social media was invented innocently enough was that they wanted to make
242240	249200	the world feel smaller. We have the entire globe at our fingertips, literally. We can connect with
249200	256880	people instantly from across the world. But somehow we got lost in this and we started to, instead of
257760	264320	trying to connect our own life, we started comparing to other people's lives. Now I personally
264320	270160	emerged from the social media cave about two years ago. And I am before that, I didn't have a Facebook,
270160	275040	I didn't have an Instagram, but I realized that if I want to do what I want to do, which is help you
275040	281120	guys mind shift your mindset, I focus a lot on emotional abuse, but basically help you get the
281120	288080	life you want and deserve, I wouldn't be able to do that without the social part, which is my Instagram,
288080	295440	my YouTube. So me, it's focusing on connection. But even myself, like I get into, I've said this
295440	301680	in my compare and despair videos and how to stop comparing yourself to others, even though I personally
301680	308080	came late in the game and I tried to do the social part of it, I even start comparing myself. I'll
308080	312240	look at other people's Instagram feeds, I'll look at other people's vanity metrics, I'll look at other
312240	317840	YouTube videos about the same subjects, how I delivered, how they delivered. So the more we
317840	323680	immerse ourselves in the social media world, the farther away we come from the physical world.
323680	329200	Now, one phrase that blew my mind, and let me know if this phrase hits a spot with you,
330080	334160	was from this researcher, I can't remember her name, I'll try to link the article below.
334160	340960	But she said, in the next decade, we may see more young people that are able to put the
340960	347440	exact emoji for a situation, but not the right facial expression. Can you imagine,
347520	353520	can you fathom how terrifying that is? Think about it, when you're on social media,
353520	358400	when somebody says something funny or you are writing and you're trying to convey emotion,
359600	366320	your mind right now is able to pick an emoji that doesn't even look like a human and add some,
366320	373040	I don't know, light to that sentence, convey some emotion. And research is now showing that
373040	378480	people are becoming less able to put the right facial expression and more able to put the right
378480	386480	emoji. This idea of comparing your social media to someone else's is called the comparison
386480	391840	orientation. And it has been coined by research as the comparison orientation. And it is also a
393680	400320	term before is compare and despair. But the comparison orientation is that you take on
400320	405200	another person's life and you constantly compare it to your own. I mean, we all have people that
405200	411680	we idolize, we all have people that we like, that we kind of want to be like them. But comparison
411680	417760	orientation takes it to another extent. Comparison orientation means that you are never satisfied
417760	421920	with the life you have, because the other person will always have a better life. They will have a
421920	427120	better house, a better husband, better kids, better job, more rich, all these stuff, all these
427120	431440	beautiful stuff. So let me know in the comments below. First of all, what are your favorite
431440	437280	social media platforms? What do you find yourself opening the first thing in the morning? I want
437280	444080	you guys to notice if you are one of those people that pick up their phone the moment they wake up.
444080	449680	And I would advise try and just sit five, 10 minutes before you immerse yourself in someone
449680	455920	else's life and just sit with your own life. And let me know in the comments below if you also
455920	461280	compare yourself to other people's media. And what exactly are you comparing? Now,
461280	467600	I hope you enjoyed this video. Make sure to smash the subscribe button somewhere here. Ring your bell
467600	472640	for your weekly Thursday videos. Give me a huge thumbs up to make mama argue them love me. But
472640	477680	most importantly, guys, share this video with someone who's become more unsocial because of
477680	480480	social media. And that's it, folks.
