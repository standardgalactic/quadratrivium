We are currently experiencing a pandemic, but never before have we had such a loneliness epidemic.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.680
It seems that we've forgotten the social part in the social media, so I want to do a video about

00:15.680 --> 00:22.560
how social media has made us more unsocial. And it seems that the more platforms that come out,

00:22.560 --> 00:28.800
the more types of social media, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, the more lonelier we become,

00:28.800 --> 00:35.200
the more we immerse ourselves in a person's highlights, literally on Instagram, a person's

00:35.200 --> 00:42.080
feed, a person's life, the more we start despairing and comparing. So this video is going to talk about

00:42.080 --> 00:48.400
why social media makes us unsocial, a few studies behind how research has observed this phenomenon

00:48.400 --> 00:54.480
and to back it up, but also just for you guys to get a harsh truth time reality check of what your

00:54.480 --> 01:00.320
daily life is. If you have no idea who I am, my name is Olympia. I have a degree in cognitive

01:00.320 --> 01:07.760
neuroscience and art history. And what I like to do, I like to dissect that pretty little brain of yours

01:07.760 --> 01:13.360
to see what makes you tick, but also what makes you talk. So make sure to smash that subscribe

01:13.360 --> 01:19.440
button and ring that bell for your weekly Thursday videos. And let's start. So one thing I want to

01:19.440 --> 01:25.520
put out there that I despise, it literally, I feel my soul is throwing up is when I see people

01:26.160 --> 01:32.880
that are in a social setting and are supposed to be together, such as watching a movie, eating a

01:32.880 --> 01:38.400
restaurant, just eating in general with someone next to you, or when you're at some kind of event,

01:38.400 --> 01:45.040
like a concert or celebrating someone's birthday party, and people have their phone out. Let me

01:45.120 --> 01:50.080
know in the comments below if this has happened to you. I've been watching a movie with like five

01:50.080 --> 01:56.080
people and each of those five people were on their phones. And I'm watching the movie and I'm

01:56.080 --> 01:59.920
thinking like, what the heck, you guys? Like I thought like this was something that we all chose

01:59.920 --> 02:05.200
to watch together and everyone's like scrolling through their feet. Now, if you haven't watched

02:05.200 --> 02:11.120
the social dilemma on Netflix, I highly recommend it because social media is basically a type of

02:11.200 --> 02:16.000
addiction. And the more, like I said, the more platforms that come out, the more we get addicted.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.600
So I bet if I asked one of those five people what the hell you're doing,

02:20.320 --> 02:24.400
they wouldn't actually register the fact that they had opened their phone and they were looking. It's

02:24.400 --> 02:31.360
just a habit because we are creatures of habits. Now, don't get me wrong. During my teenage years,

02:31.360 --> 02:37.840
I also engaged in electronic social media. I guess we didn't have social media then, but I had a

02:37.840 --> 02:42.720
Game Boy, for example, back in the day when it was politically correct to have a Game Boy, even

02:42.720 --> 02:50.720
though later on Game Girl came out. But I would also be on this device while we were having family

02:50.720 --> 02:57.760
time. But the more the internet, the more the technology advances, the less social we're becoming.

02:57.760 --> 03:04.240
The thing though is my little 90 people, my 90 babies out there, with the Game Boy, for example,

03:04.240 --> 03:08.240
we didn't have anything to compare ourselves to. Aside from maybe like how far in the game we are,

03:08.800 --> 03:12.720
we weren't looking at other people's lives. We were just kind of taking a break from whatever

03:12.720 --> 03:19.120
was going on out here and was focusing on a game here. And this is why I believe that watching

03:19.120 --> 03:24.320
social dilemma is so important because it literally explains to you how social media

03:24.320 --> 03:32.320
is designed to keep you addicted on the application. Each bell that rings, each color that application

03:32.320 --> 03:41.360
is, has been carefully selected based on what brings in the human psychology. Like the notifications

03:41.360 --> 03:49.280
you have on WhatsApp or Instagram, they're red. Red means alert. Red means look. It's something

03:49.280 --> 03:55.440
that brings your attention. So I feel that a lot of people are forgetting the social part of social

03:55.440 --> 04:02.240
media. The reason why social media was invented innocently enough was that they wanted to make

04:02.240 --> 04:09.200
the world feel smaller. We have the entire globe at our fingertips, literally. We can connect with

04:09.200 --> 04:16.880
people instantly from across the world. But somehow we got lost in this and we started to, instead of

04:17.760 --> 04:24.320
trying to connect our own life, we started comparing to other people's lives. Now I personally

04:24.320 --> 04:30.160
emerged from the social media cave about two years ago. And I am before that, I didn't have a Facebook,

04:30.160 --> 04:35.040
I didn't have an Instagram, but I realized that if I want to do what I want to do, which is help you

04:35.040 --> 04:41.120
guys mind shift your mindset, I focus a lot on emotional abuse, but basically help you get the

04:41.120 --> 04:48.080
life you want and deserve, I wouldn't be able to do that without the social part, which is my Instagram,

04:48.080 --> 04:55.440
my YouTube. So me, it's focusing on connection. But even myself, like I get into, I've said this

04:55.440 --> 05:01.680
in my compare and despair videos and how to stop comparing yourself to others, even though I personally

05:01.680 --> 05:08.080
came late in the game and I tried to do the social part of it, I even start comparing myself. I'll

05:08.080 --> 05:12.240
look at other people's Instagram feeds, I'll look at other people's vanity metrics, I'll look at other

05:12.240 --> 05:17.840
YouTube videos about the same subjects, how I delivered, how they delivered. So the more we

05:17.840 --> 05:23.680
immerse ourselves in the social media world, the farther away we come from the physical world.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.200
Now, one phrase that blew my mind, and let me know if this phrase hits a spot with you,

05:30.080 --> 05:34.160
was from this researcher, I can't remember her name, I'll try to link the article below.

05:34.160 --> 05:40.960
But she said, in the next decade, we may see more young people that are able to put the

05:40.960 --> 05:47.440
exact emoji for a situation, but not the right facial expression. Can you imagine,

05:47.520 --> 05:53.520
can you fathom how terrifying that is? Think about it, when you're on social media,

05:53.520 --> 05:58.400
when somebody says something funny or you are writing and you're trying to convey emotion,

05:59.600 --> 06:06.320
your mind right now is able to pick an emoji that doesn't even look like a human and add some,

06:06.320 --> 06:13.040
I don't know, light to that sentence, convey some emotion. And research is now showing that

06:13.040 --> 06:18.480
people are becoming less able to put the right facial expression and more able to put the right

06:18.480 --> 06:26.480
emoji. This idea of comparing your social media to someone else's is called the comparison

06:26.480 --> 06:31.840
orientation. And it has been coined by research as the comparison orientation. And it is also a

06:33.680 --> 06:40.320
term before is compare and despair. But the comparison orientation is that you take on

06:40.320 --> 06:45.200
another person's life and you constantly compare it to your own. I mean, we all have people that

06:45.200 --> 06:51.680
we idolize, we all have people that we like, that we kind of want to be like them. But comparison

06:51.680 --> 06:57.760
orientation takes it to another extent. Comparison orientation means that you are never satisfied

06:57.760 --> 07:01.920
with the life you have, because the other person will always have a better life. They will have a

07:01.920 --> 07:07.120
better house, a better husband, better kids, better job, more rich, all these stuff, all these

07:07.120 --> 07:11.440
beautiful stuff. So let me know in the comments below. First of all, what are your favorite

07:11.440 --> 07:17.280
social media platforms? What do you find yourself opening the first thing in the morning? I want

07:17.280 --> 07:24.080
you guys to notice if you are one of those people that pick up their phone the moment they wake up.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.680
And I would advise try and just sit five, 10 minutes before you immerse yourself in someone

07:29.680 --> 07:35.920
else's life and just sit with your own life. And let me know in the comments below if you also

07:35.920 --> 07:41.280
compare yourself to other people's media. And what exactly are you comparing? Now,

07:41.280 --> 07:47.600

social media. And that's it, folks.
