1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Okay, great. I'm seeing lots of people into the room. Fantastic.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:29,680
Okay, welcome everyone. This must have been a parallel session with two papers. Unfortunately,

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,920
our second presenter has fallen prey to this thing that's going around and is unable to join us.

4
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,160
Our second presenter is not well. So we will have only one paper in this session.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,520
If you wish to, after the half hour is over, investigate the other parallel sessions and

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,000
join for the last two papers in the middle of the session, that's completely fine. That's what I'm

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,600
planning to do. Okay, also to note that this session is being recorded.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,160
Just to emphasize that, I know you've had to click for your permission, but I do feel I should

9
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:16,320
note it at the beginning. Okay, so to introduce our last speaker standing, Helen Hooper from

10
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,080
Northumbria University, who will be talking about enhancing university mentoring practice

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,960
directly theory analysis of lived experiences of learning and teaching mentors.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
So Helen, handing over to you now.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,640
Okay, so I'm just sharing my slides. We did a tech check, so hopefully this is yes.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,120
So I'm assuming unless somebody shows, they can't see anything. I'm assuming the slide is still okay.

15
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:58,160
So I'm absolutely delighted to be here and unaffected by the seasonal thank goodness.

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,280
And for the next 20 minutes or so, I'll be presenting on behalf of my wonderful collaborative

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
team members at Northumbria University. And what I'm going to be aiming to do is to discuss

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,680
some initial findings of an ongoing collaborative project. And my wonderful collaborative team

19
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,040
members are all from across the university, from different faculties, different departments,

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
including staff from a central quality enhancement team. But we've got this shared goal of really

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,720
trying to dig in and explore the experiences of staff across the Institute who mentor their

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,120
colleagues to develop their teaching activity. And we've got to share this shared goal, this

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,000
shared interest, because we're really motivated to try and improve the support and recognition

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,960
for teaching and learning mentors. It builds on a previous project and I can dig into that as we go

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,600
through the presentation. So in terms of some kind of general scene setting, I don't think it would be

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,160
too controversial to say that mentoring to help colleagues develop their teaching and learning

27
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,160
practices is considered pretty important, pretty essential. And there are a number of studies

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,720
which have really attempted to look at the impacts of mentoring colleagues to support

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,640
their teaching development. And those research studies which have focused on looking at the

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,120
impacts, there's a general consensus that really mentoring those colleagues really enhances

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,720
the quality of the learning and teaching that results. Too many ways and there's a

32
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:46,480
various studies that have dug into various aspects. So they help colleagues to develop

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,320
their understanding and their knowledge about learning and teaching in general. But also and

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,480
importantly, it facilitates that knowledge transfer. So does that knowledge and understanding of

35
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:06,640
how learning and teaching best practice works, does it facilitate that to be actually incorporated

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,440
in colleagues practice and it does. And if anybody is interested in this, in the citations here,

37
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,280
I've put in a really useful systematic review of the literature looking at how mentoring for

38
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,840
teaching and learning enhances the quality of learning and teaching that results. Now in

39
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,240
complete contrast, there's a real gap in the literature and there's very little research

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,360
that actually focuses on their mental experiences and their perceptions about mentoring. So

41
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,000
what motivates people to become a learning and teaching mentor? What are the values and

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,320
depending engagement? Do learning and teaching mentors perceive existing supports effective?

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,640
Do they perceive their learning and teaching mentor enrolers valued within their team,

44
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:05,360
within their discipline, within the department or across the institute more generally? And I

45
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,640
suppose our starting point for this is mentoring is really underdeveloped as a pedagogical approach

46
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,200
for enhancing teaching. The literature out there suggests that mentoring really does enhance

47
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,840
teaching. But if we know very little about what mentors experiences and perceptions are, then

48
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,440
that's a real kind of target I suppose for us as academic developers and educational

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,400
developers more generally to try and target in and enhance support and enhance recognition

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,040
for our mentoring colleagues. So that's our shared goal. So in terms of setting the scene then,

51
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,240
I'm just one of a larger group of 11 brilliant colleagues and we've come from all faculties

52
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,280
at my institute, a wide range of departments including colleagues in the central quality

53
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,440
enhancement team. So it really is an interdisciplinary group. We're all really, really quite experienced

54
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,720
learning and teaching mentors. We provide training across the institute and within

55
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,360
our department as well as acting as mentors ourselves. And this builds upon a previous

56
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,040
research project which focused on trying to improve the support for new academic staff

57
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,040
being inducted into learning and teaching. And what came out of that project were a whole range

58
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,560
of things which did result in improved practice and process. But what came out of that in particular

59
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,280
was the central role that new academic staff perceived mentoring to have on an effective

60
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,720
induction into teaching and learning experience. And the other thing that came out of this side

61
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,840
by side, so mentoring is really important for a new staff member to feel really happy and supported

62
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
for that induction process to be effective, but also how inconsistent it was and how uneven and

63
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,640
how different the experiences of new academic staff were across the university in terms of the

64
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,560
mentors they were given, in terms of the type of mentoring and all sorts of things. So that always

65
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,320
remained with us and we thought right the next project we really need to try and do is to dig

66
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,120
into the mentor and aspect to really get that improved as well. So in terms of research James

67
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,520
then we want to really dig in and understand the perceptions of learning and teaching and mentoring

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,000
amongst mentors themselves, to identify contradictions, inconsistencies and evenness

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,400
in mentoring across the institute and to use these findings as a good evidence basis for proposing

70
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,960
changes to both policy and practice across the institute to improve the support we give to

71
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,560
mentors and to really make sure that their excellent mentoring activities is properly recognised.

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,800
Now I mentioned this project builds upon a previous project exploring the induction

73
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,440
experiences of new academic staff and we've utilised the same methodological approach because

74
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,880
it is so good and it always surprises me how the chat, so collaborative historical activity theory

75
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,560
in my opinion, should be used far more widely especially for collaborative research projects

76
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,000
in higher education. It is just so useful and it just fits the bill so brilliantly if your aim

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,040
is to really try and drive forward change. So it's a theory which encompasses expansive learning

78
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:40,000
amongst the collaborative team so it really challenges collaborators to question the notions

79
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,440
of your academic agency in terms of suggestion improvements as a basis for change and it's

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,720
all about transformation through collaborative reflection. Now this might sound a little bit

81
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,200
complicated if you've not come across this before. So chat, cultural historical activity theory,

82
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,200
it focuses on socially situated learning so thinking about everyday tasks so in this case

83
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,640
we're focusing on the experiences of learning and teaching mentors to try and identify ways to

84
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,160
improve support for them and to increase recognition for the brilliant role that they do

85
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:26,240
and we do that by setting out and mapping a specific activity system for mentoring. So an

86
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,720
activity system is defined through six interconnected elements which are listed on the bottom of the

87
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,640
slide here so this is a bit of a busy slide. The next slide shows this in terms of an image so if

88
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,560
it looks a bit confusing here hopefully it'll be a little bit clearer in the next slide. So there is

89
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,720
a subject of any activity system and we sat down as a collaborative team and mapped this out for

90
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,000
learning and teaching mentoring so the subject of our activity system is the learning and teaching

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,600
mental. The subject engages in an object of activity so here the activity is effective,

92
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,280
we defined it as effective mentoring for learning and teaching in higher education

93
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,920
and obviously that activity occurs within some kind of community so is that predominantly

94
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,160
within a department or a discipline or do actually effective mentors rely in part or predominantly

95
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,920
on interdisciplinary or institutional networks or communities of practice. These are very

96
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,360
sociocultural in nature and the remaining three elements of the activity system on the right

97
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,560
hand side of the bottom of this slide are much more structural or institutional in nature so

98
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,120
you've got a mentor engaging in mentoring in the community but that is mediated often by

99
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,080
institutionally dictated tools and resources so for example what training or CPD is available

100
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,800
for new mentors is there any further training available for experienced mentors and so on.

101
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,920
There are rules defining that activity so for example many institutions have targets for

102
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,280
new academic staff to achieve fellowship of advanced HE and there's a formal process of

103
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,880
allocating that new staff member a trained mentor to guide them through that process

104
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,640
and obviously then there's lots of conflicts and contradictions in terms of how many things

105
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,880
do people have to do so the division of labour for example is there a workload allocated

106
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,960
for that formal mentoring and how is all of the excellent informal mentoring that occurs

107
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:41,920
allocated for in terms of division of labour so if that previous slide was a little bit busy

108
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,640
maybe this slide makes it a little bit clearer so you can see two triangles there's a large one on

109
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,960
the outside and a smaller one on the inside the sociocultural elements of this activity system

110
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:00,800
the subject a mentor engaging in the object of the activity system which is effective mentoring

111
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,560
for to support colleagues develop their learning and teaching and that's within a community so it

112
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,360
might be a departmental or institutional community and then that sits within this outer triangle

113
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,400
the three remaining most structural elements of the activity system so what are the rules what are

114
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,400
the tools and resources and you know this contradiction in terms of time available so how

115
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,000
do you spend your time what's the division of labour so we sat down as a collaborative team

116
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,800
we mapped out the activity system and then in terms of generating data and how we progressed

117
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,640
with the analysis each individual team member spent quite a lot of time writing an individual vignette

118
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,960
about how learning and teaching mentoring occurred within their team or their discipline

119
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,360
but i'm from the development of an online survey we use the JISC online survey to

120
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,320
that contain both quantitative and open-ended questions so for example the quantitative questions

121
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,920
you get a workload how much of a workload you get and then open-ended questions such as do you

122
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,120
perceive your mentor learning and teaching mentoring role as valued what are the challenges

123
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,800
or the benefits associated with it and so on and in terms of the analysis it's very intuitive back

124
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,840
and forth between the data the activity system to make sure that the theme codes were organized

125
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,200
around the nodes of the activity system and really focusing on surfacing typical patterns

126
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:30,560
and contradictions because then we can use those as the basis for improvements to institutional

127
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:39,360
policy and procedure just checking the time oh i want to spend some time on the findings so again

128
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
this might be a little bit of a busy slide and i'll give you a little bit of time to to read

129
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,720
these kinds of typical themes and contradictions that the our team my team has come together

130
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:59,440
to consider and let's start at the left hand side here not one respondent to the survey

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,560
had ever been asked so these are really experienced mentors from across the university and i'm sure

132
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,160
us hopefully i'm well i'm i'm guessing that some people in in the audience today have engaged in

133
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,040
mentorship for teaching and learning have you ever been asked yourself as a practitioner

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,200
is the support for mentoring effective and do you think your role is valued do you get a work

135
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,720
load not one of our participants had ever been asked the basic questions about that really

136
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,680
valuable role before now on the flip side i was really surprised by how happy and collegiate

137
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,240
people were to engage in this kind of role and there was some conflict and and contradictions

138
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:50,480
in terms of respondents and perceptions about whether or not you should be mentoring for a

139
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,640
whole academic at my institute at many institutes mentoring mentoring for learning and teaching

140
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,040
is separate and distinct including a separate person for learning and teaching as opposed to

141
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,280
research and there are various reasons for that and conflict and contradictions in terms of whether

142
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,080
or not that's perceived to be effective or whether on balance mentoring for for the whole

143
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:22,640
academic is an ideal that we should maybe be trying to work towards um uh then this is an

144
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,000
interesting one there is some assumption and i think i was guilty of this myself that if you're

145
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,800
good at something so if you were if you're an effective teacher then you'd be an effective

146
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,080
mentor in helping colleagues develop their teaching practice and that is probably not so

147
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,040
true and in terms of the institutional support for uh mentor training it's very much focused

148
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,200
on helping new and relatively inexperienced colleagues gain fellowship or granted cheap

149
00:15:53,200 --> 00:16:01,280
because that's the institutional kpi associated with with um with activity very little uh development

150
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,560
for example for colleagues who need to be working in professional practice

151
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:13,040
so lots of really rich data coming in from both the vignettes and the surveys for mentors across

152
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,080
the university now just just in order to spend a few moments on some initial reflections and

153
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,600
learnings again the the chat theory it really has promoted expansive learning amongst our

154
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,400
collaborative team and at the moment we're sitting down and we're in the process of thinking

155
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,960
through the implications in terms of suggestions and things we want to take forward to really try

156
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,840
and improve the institutional support and the recognition for our brilliant uh learning teaching

157
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,200
mentors so something we really need do need to work on is to get to a reasonable level of

158
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,680
recognition and reward especially in formal processes and procedures so for example promotional

159
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,480
processes appraisal process process and things like we've got an institutional scheme for professional

160
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,480
recognition by advanced hg can we embed some criteria therefore senior fellowship or principal

161
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,920
fellowship and we're kicking around ideas as well for a more celebratory approach so can we give some

162
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,520
kind of institutional prize or can there be a small pot of funding for cpdo research and so on

163
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,960
and surprisingly i'm i'm guessing for some of you would be inconsistent mental workload so

164
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,560
some people had to workload others were completely unaware if they did and if they did it was hidden

165
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,280
in some kind of workload spreadsheet so there's not even a line on the workload spreadsheet so i

166
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
think there is a real need to increase mental workload and to get that implemented a bit more

167
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,800
consistently a really strong feedback in terms of this this really crucial role basically being

168
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,000
invisible especially the informal kind of mentoring that goes on every single day so a reliance on

169
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,520
ongoing above and beyond and professional generosity and something we hadn't thought about was what's

170
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,760
the best mentee and mental pairings should they actually be set determined discipline based into

171
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,480
discipline based and that's something that we're going to think about and i really like colleagues

172
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,040
feedback and ideas on any of these so if there's an opportunity for me to to steal some good practice

173
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,320
i'm definitely going to do that and take it back to to um my colleagues at Northumbria um there's

174
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,920
definitely an unmet need for a little bit of extra training especially for mentors who are helping

175
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:38,560
colleagues develop their practice for professional practice rather than just teaching at a university

176
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:47,280
kind of standard approaches and what also came out of this was how much mentors gain from mentoring

177
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:57,280
mentees who have brilliant knowledge to share and especially things like digital literacy so i'm

178
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,000
currently mentoring a relatively new staff who has very little teaching experiences but absolutely

179
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,160
fantastic on generative AI an area which i know very very little about so i think we do have capacity

180
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,400
here to promote the benefits and to capture the benefits of reciprocal mentoring regardless of

181
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,320
status or prior experience or anything along those lines so i think with just maybe one or two minutes

182
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:31,840
left i'm probably going to end there and i really really welcome any comments or questions or any

183
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,880
good practice that you'd like to share

184
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,840
i'm getting my screen back um thank you very much that was a really interesting presentation

185
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:04,640
um if anyone has any questions in the uh who in the attendance list here please do let me know

186
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,520
pop it in the chat or just raise your your hand electronically i was really interested Helen in

187
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:19,600
that last slide um where you were talking about um the uh the potential benefits um and you were

188
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:27,280
talking about the the mentor mentee pairings and how these might be rethought how the organization

189
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,960
of those might be rethought and i was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how those are

190
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,440
currently arranged at Northumbria does it vary across department or yeah so it'll be really

191
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
just again to get other people's kind of perspectives on this so at Northumbria even

192
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,200
though it's a reasonably large and quite complex kind of organization and my own faculty is split

193
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
on two different campuses really quite large deeper mental and discipline based teams

194
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,840
we still have this kind of one we have this notional one university approach

195
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,120
but then when you actually dig in and actually go and have a look at what happens in departments

196
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,240
and discipline teams it's clearly not a one university approach so what's really nice about

197
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,200
doing these kinds of projects is to actually find out what happens in reality regardless of the

198
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,360
notional one university approach to processes and practices so in my own department i allocate

199
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,000
formal mentors to new academic staff and what i generally tend to do is to allocate a mentor from

200
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,480
outside the direct program or disability team because then there's no kind of conflicts of

201
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,760
interest in terms of a bit of teaching practice going on and you also get opportunity to share

202
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,800
good practice across the department more generally it also gives new academic members of staff a wider

203
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,960
network outside their initial disability team because they can draw on expertise and they get to

204
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,200
know people from other programs or other areas but that's very different to other departments

205
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,040
and disciplines so in some of the more professionally oriented departments and programs there's very

206
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,600
much an allocate from that specific discipline area because there's niche knowledge that's really

207
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,320
helpful for the new academic staff member to to get on board with and to understand so

208
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,040
i'm not so sure that there's a correct answer to that but it's not something that i ever thought

209
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,120
about before and what i did after thinking about this because this came out of the data analysis

210
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,840
was take this back to my own departmental teaching and learning enhancement team and say

211
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
look we've always done this in the past but there's these other ways of thinking about

212
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,240
things and doing things shall we try something new or actually if it's not broken shall we not fix it

213
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
so i think what's good about this approach and what's good about this method

214
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,400
is it stimulates that discussion and that collaborative reflection and it also i find

215
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,240
this so valuable myself it's about the academic agency you are the captain of your own destiny

216
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,880
what are we going to do as a team to try and make things a bit better for everybody

217
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,960
so that was that was a bit of a long winded answer did i answer your question

218
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,600
no it's all it's just all really interesting isn't it i mean um yeah that that perspective is

219
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,560
is really interesting um i see that richard davies has his hand raised would you like to

220
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:29,520
post your question and yeah thanks very much um my question really is about um the design of the

221
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:37,760
chat system and i i guess my question is is to what extent the data confirms this kind of

222
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,320
setting out of it or whether there are multiple ways in which the activity system could be laid

223
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,560
out in relation both i think to the different kinds of communities and different rules um

224
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:57,440
but also whether or not um how you think about what the um the object is and the output of them

225
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,040
and to what extent it feeds into the activity um system of teaching and learning itself

226
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,400
um and i just i just wondered where you had thoughts about whether this was a

227
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,520
where this was a kind of a strong activity this theoretically strong activity system or

228
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,160
whether it was it was a kind of a heuristic and there were alternatives that might also

229
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,600
fit the data thanks yeah richard so i i think this is this i think we could talk about that for

230
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,360
probably about an hour or something so um this is the second project that i've been involved with

231
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,640
with which utilised the activity system and this chat approach and i come from a kind of hard

232
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,640
science background so my background is a molecular biologist um and a colleague of mine

233
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
Sue Matheson who's in the central quality enhancement team is an educational developer

234
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,160
by practice and by research so she really led on on teaching us and um developing our knowledge

235
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,800
and understanding of this approach so that's the caveat to what i'm going to say i've been

236
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,840
involved with it for about five years we've done a couple of projects but i don't really consider

237
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,000
myself to be an expert in the field i'm kind of more of a practitioner i put it in putting it

238
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,480
into practice i think i think about it as a really valuable tool both for data generation

239
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,840
and analysis but also for personal and practitioner educational development so i think i gain as much

240
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,600
out of it as what we learn from the participants responses and so on so to try and answer your

241
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:38,400
question a bit more focused so um with this activity system the one i presented is probably

242
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,520
about both iteration so we go away we have a thing we come back and we draft it out and

243
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,000
then we talk about it and then we go away we have a thing about it in practice we come back

244
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,080
and we talk about it and so um we get to a stage as a collaborative team so there's 11 of us from

245
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,400
all four faculties from eight different departments um 10 different disciplines on a central team

246
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,880
and we've got that breadth so i suppose a weakness if you can call it a weakness is i think it would

247
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,400
be much more tighter and focused if i define that within my department but i think that weakness is

248
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,560
also a strength because if you're trying to develop and improve support and recognition

249
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,240
for colleagues who engage in mentorship across the university you do have to have that that kind of

250
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,960
the breadth so i if i remember correctly that's about the fourth iteration that we agreed upon

251
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,760
where it was general enough to reflect everybody's practice and understanding but tight enough

252
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:46,400
to be useful as a tool for data analysis and then reflection and the focus of this i think is to

253
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,160
identify those common experiences and contradictions because that's the basis on which then you say

254
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,880
this is what we do reasonably well and we should fight and argue to keep that going but actually

255
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,520
these are things that are unhelpful because they're different in different departments and

256
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,960
there's unmet need for training or it gives you some ideas for things that you haven't tried out

257
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,440
before there could be a bit better in your own department um so i think if you take that here's

258
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,360
my feeling i think if you take that and maybe try and apply it at your own institute you plan

259
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,240
i'm guessing that you would come to something pretty similar if you did it across your institute

260
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,320
if you did it in a tighter team it might be a bit different does does that make sense does that answer

261
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,520
your question or not have you experienced of it or would you would you say something different

262
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,520
it'll be really interesting to find out no i think i think i think i guess uh no timber and you can

263
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,440
be similar in the sense that we have quite centralized teaching and learning um policies

264
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,920
and framework so i guess across the institution um i i would think it would be interesting to see

265
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:58,960
what it would look like at say some of the you know that's based at one of the kind of more

266
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,920
entrepreneurial universities that's um uh where um departments are actually quite distinct in terms of

267
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,120
their culture and activity um and potentially more driven by um the academic discipline than

268
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,880
perhaps many of our schools are because they're primarily driven by more vocational occupational

269
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,960
concerns um so i guess there would be similarities i think might i think where we might look at

270
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,680
differently is is whether we're actually whether we're trying to provide if whether the outcome is

271
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,600
providing effective mentoring or whether it's about providing effective teaching learning

272
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,320
within particular schools so um so that we that so that the effective mentoring will be a kind of

273
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,920
mediating uh feature i think for us as opposed and that's partly because we're driven by as many

274
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:01,120
are by rfs requirements in terms of theory of change and impact upon student metrics and so

275
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:09,040
quite a lot of what we do see the kind of work with staff as as mediating the actual goal which is

276
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:14,640
the improvements of learning and to some extent teaching kind of almost drops out as a as a final

277
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,480
so what you're doing what you're doing there is is i'm getting deja vu that was our first conversation

278
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,800
so how tight should be the relationship between the subject and the object

279
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,760
and we ended up as quite a tight relationship because if it's mentors it has to be support for

280
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,160
mentoring and not everything else because that's a bit too broad um so so that's that's that but

281
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,360
you go through those cycles as a team to say and to divine it so it's quite a time consuming process

282
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,320
but it's very valuable because it really makes you unpick and think about things that you might

283
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,400
either haven't thought about since you were a new mentor or you'd never thought about before

284
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,200
hey thanks

285
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,400
um was there a question in the chat player i've not been keeping an eye on no um one of the

286
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,760
questions just want to leave yeah yeah and we're thanking you for for a great session um

287
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,720
were there any other questions in the room otherwise i think we can all exit and go on

288
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,000
through another session but um Helen thank you very much that was really interesting uh you're

289
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,240
your perspective on that um i think it's really interesting work so we'd love to hear back from

290
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,800
you again yeah well thanks for listening and thanks thanks for the input it's fantastic

291
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,960
excellent okay and we'll see you again soon yeah brilliant thanks very much bye everybody

292
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,160
bye now
