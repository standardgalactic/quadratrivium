0	18400	Okay, great. I'm seeing lots of people into the room. Fantastic.
18400	29680	Okay, welcome everyone. This must have been a parallel session with two papers. Unfortunately,
29680	35920	our second presenter has fallen prey to this thing that's going around and is unable to join us.
36640	42160	Our second presenter is not well. So we will have only one paper in this session.
43760	49520	If you wish to, after the half hour is over, investigate the other parallel sessions and
49520	54000	join for the last two papers in the middle of the session, that's completely fine. That's what I'm
54000	59600	planning to do. Okay, also to note that this session is being recorded.
61120	68160	Just to emphasize that, I know you've had to click for your permission, but I do feel I should
68160	76320	note it at the beginning. Okay, so to introduce our last speaker standing, Helen Hooper from
76320	82080	Northumbria University, who will be talking about enhancing university mentoring practice
82080	86960	directly theory analysis of lived experiences of learning and teaching mentors.
87760	89760	So Helen, handing over to you now.
96000	104640	Okay, so I'm just sharing my slides. We did a tech check, so hopefully this is yes.
104640	111120	So I'm assuming unless somebody shows, they can't see anything. I'm assuming the slide is still okay.
111120	118160	So I'm absolutely delighted to be here and unaffected by the seasonal thank goodness.
119040	125280	And for the next 20 minutes or so, I'll be presenting on behalf of my wonderful collaborative
125280	130640	team members at Northumbria University. And what I'm going to be aiming to do is to discuss
130640	137680	some initial findings of an ongoing collaborative project. And my wonderful collaborative team
137680	143040	members are all from across the university, from different faculties, different departments,
143040	148800	including staff from a central quality enhancement team. But we've got this shared goal of really
148800	154720	trying to dig in and explore the experiences of staff across the Institute who mentor their
154720	159120	colleagues to develop their teaching activity. And we've got to share this shared goal, this
159120	166000	shared interest, because we're really motivated to try and improve the support and recognition
166000	172960	for teaching and learning mentors. It builds on a previous project and I can dig into that as we go
172960	179600	through the presentation. So in terms of some kind of general scene setting, I don't think it would be
179600	186160	too controversial to say that mentoring to help colleagues develop their teaching and learning
186160	192160	practices is considered pretty important, pretty essential. And there are a number of studies
192160	198720	which have really attempted to look at the impacts of mentoring colleagues to support
198720	204640	their teaching development. And those research studies which have focused on looking at the
204640	211120	impacts, there's a general consensus that really mentoring those colleagues really enhances
211120	216720	the quality of the learning and teaching that results. Too many ways and there's a
216720	226480	various studies that have dug into various aspects. So they help colleagues to develop
226480	232320	their understanding and their knowledge about learning and teaching in general. But also and
232320	238480	importantly, it facilitates that knowledge transfer. So does that knowledge and understanding of
238480	246640	how learning and teaching best practice works, does it facilitate that to be actually incorporated
246960	253440	in colleagues practice and it does. And if anybody is interested in this, in the citations here,
253440	259280	I've put in a really useful systematic review of the literature looking at how mentoring for
259280	265840	teaching and learning enhances the quality of learning and teaching that results. Now in
265840	272240	complete contrast, there's a real gap in the literature and there's very little research
272320	279360	that actually focuses on their mental experiences and their perceptions about mentoring. So
279360	286000	what motivates people to become a learning and teaching mentor? What are the values and
286000	292320	depending engagement? Do learning and teaching mentors perceive existing supports effective?
294160	298640	Do they perceive their learning and teaching mentor enrolers valued within their team,
298640	305360	within their discipline, within the department or across the institute more generally? And I
305360	312640	suppose our starting point for this is mentoring is really underdeveloped as a pedagogical approach
312640	317200	for enhancing teaching. The literature out there suggests that mentoring really does enhance
317200	323840	teaching. But if we know very little about what mentors experiences and perceptions are, then
324320	329440	that's a real kind of target I suppose for us as academic developers and educational
329440	336400	developers more generally to try and target in and enhance support and enhance recognition
336400	343040	for our mentoring colleagues. So that's our shared goal. So in terms of setting the scene then,
343840	350240	I'm just one of a larger group of 11 brilliant colleagues and we've come from all faculties
350240	355280	at my institute, a wide range of departments including colleagues in the central quality
355280	361440	enhancement team. So it really is an interdisciplinary group. We're all really, really quite experienced
362080	366720	learning and teaching mentors. We provide training across the institute and within
366720	373360	our department as well as acting as mentors ourselves. And this builds upon a previous
373360	381040	research project which focused on trying to improve the support for new academic staff
381680	389040	being inducted into learning and teaching. And what came out of that project were a whole range
389040	396560	of things which did result in improved practice and process. But what came out of that in particular
396560	403280	was the central role that new academic staff perceived mentoring to have on an effective
403280	408720	induction into teaching and learning experience. And the other thing that came out of this side
408720	415840	by side, so mentoring is really important for a new staff member to feel really happy and supported
417440	422240	for that induction process to be effective, but also how inconsistent it was and how uneven and
422320	428640	how different the experiences of new academic staff were across the university in terms of the
428640	434560	mentors they were given, in terms of the type of mentoring and all sorts of things. So that always
434560	438320	remained with us and we thought right the next project we really need to try and do is to dig
438320	443120	into the mentor and aspect to really get that improved as well. So in terms of research James
443120	447520	then we want to really dig in and understand the perceptions of learning and teaching and mentoring
447520	454000	amongst mentors themselves, to identify contradictions, inconsistencies and evenness
454000	460400	in mentoring across the institute and to use these findings as a good evidence basis for proposing
460400	464960	changes to both policy and practice across the institute to improve the support we give to
464960	470560	mentors and to really make sure that their excellent mentoring activities is properly recognised.
471760	476800	Now I mentioned this project builds upon a previous project exploring the induction
476800	483440	experiences of new academic staff and we've utilised the same methodological approach because
483440	490880	it is so good and it always surprises me how the chat, so collaborative historical activity theory
490880	496560	in my opinion, should be used far more widely especially for collaborative research projects
496560	504000	in higher education. It is just so useful and it just fits the bill so brilliantly if your aim
504000	513040	is to really try and drive forward change. So it's a theory which encompasses expansive learning
513040	520000	amongst the collaborative team so it really challenges collaborators to question the notions
520000	527440	of your academic agency in terms of suggestion improvements as a basis for change and it's
527440	532720	all about transformation through collaborative reflection. Now this might sound a little bit
532720	539200	complicated if you've not come across this before. So chat, cultural historical activity theory,
539840	547200	it focuses on socially situated learning so thinking about everyday tasks so in this case
547200	552640	we're focusing on the experiences of learning and teaching mentors to try and identify ways to
552640	558160	improve support for them and to increase recognition for the brilliant role that they do
558560	566240	and we do that by setting out and mapping a specific activity system for mentoring. So an
566240	572720	activity system is defined through six interconnected elements which are listed on the bottom of the
572720	578640	slide here so this is a bit of a busy slide. The next slide shows this in terms of an image so if
578640	584560	it looks a bit confusing here hopefully it'll be a little bit clearer in the next slide. So there is
584560	590720	a subject of any activity system and we sat down as a collaborative team and mapped this out for
590720	596000	learning and teaching mentoring so the subject of our activity system is the learning and teaching
596000	603600	mental. The subject engages in an object of activity so here the activity is effective,
603600	607280	we defined it as effective mentoring for learning and teaching in higher education
607920	613920	and obviously that activity occurs within some kind of community so is that predominantly
613920	620160	within a department or a discipline or do actually effective mentors rely in part or predominantly
620160	627920	on interdisciplinary or institutional networks or communities of practice. These are very
627920	633360	sociocultural in nature and the remaining three elements of the activity system on the right
633360	638560	hand side of the bottom of this slide are much more structural or institutional in nature so
638640	645120	you've got a mentor engaging in mentoring in the community but that is mediated often by
645120	652080	institutionally dictated tools and resources so for example what training or CPD is available
652080	658800	for new mentors is there any further training available for experienced mentors and so on.
659440	665920	There are rules defining that activity so for example many institutions have targets for
665920	671280	new academic staff to achieve fellowship of advanced HE and there's a formal process of
671280	676880	allocating that new staff member a trained mentor to guide them through that process
677600	682640	and obviously then there's lots of conflicts and contradictions in terms of how many things
682640	688880	do people have to do so the division of labour for example is there a workload allocated
688880	694960	for that formal mentoring and how is all of the excellent informal mentoring that occurs
694960	701920	allocated for in terms of division of labour so if that previous slide was a little bit busy
701920	706640	maybe this slide makes it a little bit clearer so you can see two triangles there's a large one on
706640	712960	the outside and a smaller one on the inside the sociocultural elements of this activity system
713520	720800	the subject a mentor engaging in the object of the activity system which is effective mentoring
721760	726560	for to support colleagues develop their learning and teaching and that's within a community so it
726560	733360	might be a departmental or institutional community and then that sits within this outer triangle
733360	738400	the three remaining most structural elements of the activity system so what are the rules what are
738400	744400	the tools and resources and you know this contradiction in terms of time available so how
744400	750000	do you spend your time what's the division of labour so we sat down as a collaborative team
750000	754800	we mapped out the activity system and then in terms of generating data and how we progressed
754800	760640	with the analysis each individual team member spent quite a lot of time writing an individual vignette
761200	766960	about how learning and teaching mentoring occurred within their team or their discipline
766960	771360	but i'm from the development of an online survey we use the JISC online survey to
771360	776320	that contain both quantitative and open-ended questions so for example the quantitative questions
776320	781920	you get a workload how much of a workload you get and then open-ended questions such as do you
781920	787120	perceive your mentor learning and teaching mentoring role as valued what are the challenges
787120	792800	or the benefits associated with it and so on and in terms of the analysis it's very intuitive back
792800	797840	and forth between the data the activity system to make sure that the theme codes were organized
797840	803200	around the nodes of the activity system and really focusing on surfacing typical patterns
803280	810560	and contradictions because then we can use those as the basis for improvements to institutional
810560	819360	policy and procedure just checking the time oh i want to spend some time on the findings so again
819360	823120	this might be a little bit of a busy slide and i'll give you a little bit of time to to read
823120	830720	these kinds of typical themes and contradictions that the our team my team has come together
831280	839440	to consider and let's start at the left hand side here not one respondent to the survey
839440	844560	had ever been asked so these are really experienced mentors from across the university and i'm sure
844560	850160	us hopefully i'm well i'm i'm guessing that some people in in the audience today have engaged in
850160	857040	mentorship for teaching and learning have you ever been asked yourself as a practitioner
857760	863200	is the support for mentoring effective and do you think your role is valued do you get a work
863200	868720	load not one of our participants had ever been asked the basic questions about that really
868720	875680	valuable role before now on the flip side i was really surprised by how happy and collegiate
875680	882240	people were to engage in this kind of role and there was some conflict and and contradictions
882240	890480	in terms of respondents and perceptions about whether or not you should be mentoring for a
890480	896640	whole academic at my institute at many institutes mentoring mentoring for learning and teaching
896640	903040	is separate and distinct including a separate person for learning and teaching as opposed to
903040	909280	research and there are various reasons for that and conflict and contradictions in terms of whether
909280	914080	or not that's perceived to be effective or whether on balance mentoring for for the whole
914080	922640	academic is an ideal that we should maybe be trying to work towards um uh then this is an
922640	928000	interesting one there is some assumption and i think i was guilty of this myself that if you're
928000	934800	good at something so if you were if you're an effective teacher then you'd be an effective
934800	940080	mentor in helping colleagues develop their teaching practice and that is probably not so
940080	947040	true and in terms of the institutional support for uh mentor training it's very much focused
947040	953200	on helping new and relatively inexperienced colleagues gain fellowship or granted cheap
953200	961280	because that's the institutional kpi associated with with um with activity very little uh development
961280	964560	for example for colleagues who need to be working in professional practice
965200	973040	so lots of really rich data coming in from both the vignettes and the surveys for mentors across
973040	980080	the university now just just in order to spend a few moments on some initial reflections and
980080	987600	learnings again the the chat theory it really has promoted expansive learning amongst our
987600	992400	collaborative team and at the moment we're sitting down and we're in the process of thinking
992400	998960	through the implications in terms of suggestions and things we want to take forward to really try
998960	1005840	and improve the institutional support and the recognition for our brilliant uh learning teaching
1005840	1013200	mentors so something we really need do need to work on is to get to a reasonable level of
1013280	1019680	recognition and reward especially in formal processes and procedures so for example promotional
1019680	1026480	processes appraisal process process and things like we've got an institutional scheme for professional
1026480	1032480	recognition by advanced hg can we embed some criteria therefore senior fellowship or principal
1032480	1037920	fellowship and we're kicking around ideas as well for a more celebratory approach so can we give some
1037920	1043520	kind of institutional prize or can there be a small pot of funding for cpdo research and so on
1044720	1050960	and surprisingly i'm i'm guessing for some of you would be inconsistent mental workload so
1050960	1056560	some people had to workload others were completely unaware if they did and if they did it was hidden
1056560	1061280	in some kind of workload spreadsheet so there's not even a line on the workload spreadsheet so i
1061280	1067440	think there is a real need to increase mental workload and to get that implemented a bit more
1067440	1074800	consistently a really strong feedback in terms of this this really crucial role basically being
1074800	1080000	invisible especially the informal kind of mentoring that goes on every single day so a reliance on
1080000	1085520	ongoing above and beyond and professional generosity and something we hadn't thought about was what's
1085520	1091760	the best mentee and mental pairings should they actually be set determined discipline based into
1091760	1096480	discipline based and that's something that we're going to think about and i really like colleagues
1096480	1101040	feedback and ideas on any of these so if there's an opportunity for me to to steal some good practice
1101040	1106320	i'm definitely going to do that and take it back to to um my colleagues at Northumbria um there's
1106320	1111920	definitely an unmet need for a little bit of extra training especially for mentors who are helping
1111920	1118560	colleagues develop their practice for professional practice rather than just teaching at a university
1118560	1127280	kind of standard approaches and what also came out of this was how much mentors gain from mentoring
1127280	1137280	mentees who have brilliant knowledge to share and especially things like digital literacy so i'm
1137280	1144000	currently mentoring a relatively new staff who has very little teaching experiences but absolutely
1144000	1150160	fantastic on generative AI an area which i know very very little about so i think we do have capacity
1150160	1156400	here to promote the benefits and to capture the benefits of reciprocal mentoring regardless of
1156400	1164320	status or prior experience or anything along those lines so i think with just maybe one or two minutes
1164320	1171840	left i'm probably going to end there and i really really welcome any comments or questions or any
1171840	1174880	good practice that you'd like to share
1187680	1193840	i'm getting my screen back um thank you very much that was a really interesting presentation
1194400	1204640	um if anyone has any questions in the uh who in the attendance list here please do let me know
1204640	1211520	pop it in the chat or just raise your your hand electronically i was really interested Helen in
1211520	1219600	that last slide um where you were talking about um the uh the potential benefits um and you were
1219600	1227280	talking about the the mentor mentee pairings and how these might be rethought how the organization
1227280	1232960	of those might be rethought and i was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how those are
1232960	1239440	currently arranged at Northumbria does it vary across department or yeah so it'll be really
1239440	1243520	just again to get other people's kind of perspectives on this so at Northumbria even
1243520	1249200	though it's a reasonably large and quite complex kind of organization and my own faculty is split
1249200	1253360	on two different campuses really quite large deeper mental and discipline based teams
1254080	1257840	we still have this kind of one we have this notional one university approach
1259040	1263120	but then when you actually dig in and actually go and have a look at what happens in departments
1263120	1268240	and discipline teams it's clearly not a one university approach so what's really nice about
1268240	1273200	doing these kinds of projects is to actually find out what happens in reality regardless of the
1273200	1279360	notional one university approach to processes and practices so in my own department i allocate
1279360	1286000	formal mentors to new academic staff and what i generally tend to do is to allocate a mentor from
1286000	1290480	outside the direct program or disability team because then there's no kind of conflicts of
1290480	1295760	interest in terms of a bit of teaching practice going on and you also get opportunity to share
1295760	1302800	good practice across the department more generally it also gives new academic members of staff a wider
1302800	1306960	network outside their initial disability team because they can draw on expertise and they get to
1306960	1313200	know people from other programs or other areas but that's very different to other departments
1313200	1319040	and disciplines so in some of the more professionally oriented departments and programs there's very
1319040	1325600	much an allocate from that specific discipline area because there's niche knowledge that's really
1325600	1332320	helpful for the new academic staff member to to get on board with and to understand so
1332880	1339040	i'm not so sure that there's a correct answer to that but it's not something that i ever thought
1339040	1345120	about before and what i did after thinking about this because this came out of the data analysis
1345120	1349840	was take this back to my own departmental teaching and learning enhancement team and say
1349840	1353360	look we've always done this in the past but there's these other ways of thinking about
1353360	1360240	things and doing things shall we try something new or actually if it's not broken shall we not fix it
1360240	1364080	so i think what's good about this approach and what's good about this method
1364080	1370400	is it stimulates that discussion and that collaborative reflection and it also i find
1370400	1376240	this so valuable myself it's about the academic agency you are the captain of your own destiny
1376240	1380880	what are we going to do as a team to try and make things a bit better for everybody
1382080	1386960	so that was that was a bit of a long winded answer did i answer your question
1387920	1393600	no it's all it's just all really interesting isn't it i mean um yeah that that perspective is
1393600	1400560	is really interesting um i see that richard davies has his hand raised would you like to
1400560	1409520	post your question and yeah thanks very much um my question really is about um the design of the
1409600	1417760	chat system and i i guess my question is is to what extent the data confirms this kind of
1418320	1424320	setting out of it or whether there are multiple ways in which the activity system could be laid
1424320	1430560	out in relation both i think to the different kinds of communities and different rules um
1430560	1437440	but also whether or not um how you think about what the um the object is and the output of them
1438240	1445040	and to what extent it feeds into the activity um system of teaching and learning itself
1445600	1450400	um and i just i just wondered where you had thoughts about whether this was a
1451600	1457520	where this was a kind of a strong activity this theoretically strong activity system or
1457520	1462160	whether it was it was a kind of a heuristic and there were alternatives that might also
1462880	1469600	fit the data thanks yeah richard so i i think this is this i think we could talk about that for
1469600	1475360	probably about an hour or something so um this is the second project that i've been involved with
1475360	1480640	with which utilised the activity system and this chat approach and i come from a kind of hard
1480640	1486640	science background so my background is a molecular biologist um and a colleague of mine
1486640	1491360	Sue Matheson who's in the central quality enhancement team is an educational developer
1491360	1498160	by practice and by research so she really led on on teaching us and um developing our knowledge
1498160	1502800	and understanding of this approach so that's the caveat to what i'm going to say i've been
1502800	1507840	involved with it for about five years we've done a couple of projects but i don't really consider
1507840	1512000	myself to be an expert in the field i'm kind of more of a practitioner i put it in putting it
1512080	1518480	into practice i think i think about it as a really valuable tool both for data generation
1518480	1523840	and analysis but also for personal and practitioner educational development so i think i gain as much
1523840	1529600	out of it as what we learn from the participants responses and so on so to try and answer your
1529600	1538400	question a bit more focused so um with this activity system the one i presented is probably
1538480	1543520	about both iteration so we go away we have a thing we come back and we draft it out and
1543520	1548000	then we talk about it and then we go away we have a thing about it in practice we come back
1548000	1554080	and we talk about it and so um we get to a stage as a collaborative team so there's 11 of us from
1554080	1560400	all four faculties from eight different departments um 10 different disciplines on a central team
1560400	1566880	and we've got that breadth so i suppose a weakness if you can call it a weakness is i think it would
1566880	1574400	be much more tighter and focused if i define that within my department but i think that weakness is
1574400	1578560	also a strength because if you're trying to develop and improve support and recognition
1578560	1584240	for colleagues who engage in mentorship across the university you do have to have that that kind of
1584240	1590960	the breadth so i if i remember correctly that's about the fourth iteration that we agreed upon
1590960	1597760	where it was general enough to reflect everybody's practice and understanding but tight enough
1597760	1606400	to be useful as a tool for data analysis and then reflection and the focus of this i think is to
1606400	1612160	identify those common experiences and contradictions because that's the basis on which then you say
1612160	1616880	this is what we do reasonably well and we should fight and argue to keep that going but actually
1616880	1621520	these are things that are unhelpful because they're different in different departments and
1621520	1626960	there's unmet need for training or it gives you some ideas for things that you haven't tried out
1626960	1633440	before there could be a bit better in your own department um so i think if you take that here's
1633440	1639360	my feeling i think if you take that and maybe try and apply it at your own institute you plan
1639360	1644240	i'm guessing that you would come to something pretty similar if you did it across your institute
1644880	1650320	if you did it in a tighter team it might be a bit different does does that make sense does that answer
1650320	1655520	your question or not have you experienced of it or would you would you say something different
1655520	1661520	it'll be really interesting to find out no i think i think i think i guess uh no timber and you can
1661520	1667440	be similar in the sense that we have quite centralized teaching and learning um policies
1667440	1673920	and framework so i guess across the institution um i i would think it would be interesting to see
1673920	1678960	what it would look like at say some of the you know that's based at one of the kind of more
1678960	1685920	entrepreneurial universities that's um uh where um departments are actually quite distinct in terms of
1685920	1693120	their culture and activity um and potentially more driven by um the academic discipline than
1693120	1698880	perhaps many of our schools are because they're primarily driven by more vocational occupational
1699760	1706960	concerns um so i guess there would be similarities i think might i think where we might look at
1706960	1713680	differently is is whether we're actually whether we're trying to provide if whether the outcome is
1713680	1719600	providing effective mentoring or whether it's about providing effective teaching learning
1719600	1726320	within particular schools so um so that we that so that the effective mentoring will be a kind of
1726320	1733920	mediating uh feature i think for us as opposed and that's partly because we're driven by as many
1733920	1741120	are by rfs requirements in terms of theory of change and impact upon student metrics and so
1741680	1749040	quite a lot of what we do see the kind of work with staff as as mediating the actual goal which is
1749040	1754640	the improvements of learning and to some extent teaching kind of almost drops out as a as a final
1755120	1760480	so what you're doing what you're doing there is is i'm getting deja vu that was our first conversation
1761120	1764800	so how tight should be the relationship between the subject and the object
1764800	1769760	and we ended up as quite a tight relationship because if it's mentors it has to be support for
1769760	1776160	mentoring and not everything else because that's a bit too broad um so so that's that's that but
1776160	1781360	you go through those cycles as a team to say and to divine it so it's quite a time consuming process
1781360	1786320	but it's very valuable because it really makes you unpick and think about things that you might
1786320	1790400	either haven't thought about since you were a new mentor or you'd never thought about before
1792640	1793200	hey thanks
1795200	1800400	um was there a question in the chat player i've not been keeping an eye on no um one of the
1800400	1805760	questions just want to leave yeah yeah and we're thanking you for for a great session um
1806480	1812720	were there any other questions in the room otherwise i think we can all exit and go on
1812720	1818000	through another session but um Helen thank you very much that was really interesting uh you're
1818000	1824240	your perspective on that um i think it's really interesting work so we'd love to hear back from
1824240	1828800	you again yeah well thanks for listening and thanks thanks for the input it's fantastic
1829680	1834960	excellent okay and we'll see you again soon yeah brilliant thanks very much bye everybody
1834960	1838160	bye now
