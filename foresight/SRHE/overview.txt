Checking SRHE/SRHE2023 Parallel Session 4_1.txt
 The discussion revolved around the process of creating a tool to support and recognize mentorship across an entire university, involving collaboration from 11 members from four faculties and eight different departments. The team had to balance having a broad enough scope to be applicable to all disciplines with being specific enough for data analysis and reflection. The result was an iterative process that led to a tool general enough to reflect everyone's practice yet tight enough to be useful.

Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Breadth vs. Focus**: The team recognized that having a broad range of disciplines involved could both be a strength and a weakness. It allows for diverse perspectives but may also require more effort to find common ground.

2. **Common Experiences and Contradictions**: Identifying shared experiences and challenges is crucial as it helps pinpoint what the team does well, what needs improvement, and where additional training might be necessary.

3. **Institutional Variability**: The discussion also touched on how this process might differ in institutions with more distinct departmental cultures or those driven by vocational goals rather than academic disciplines.

4. **Mentoring vs. Teaching**: Some institutions may prioritize mentoring as a means to an end (e.g., RFS requirements, student metrics), while others might focus directly on teaching and learning outcomes.

5. **Iterative Process**: The team emphasized the importance of going through several iterations to refine the tool, ensuring it addresses relevant issues and incorporates feedback from all disciplines.

6. **Feedback and Continuous Improvement**: The process is valuable as it encourages participants to revisit and think critically about their practices, whether they are new to mentoring or have been doing it for a long time.

7. **Future Work**: There was an interest in applying similar processes at different institutions to see how the outcomes might vary based on institutional culture and priorities.

The session ended with gratitude for the input and collaboration, and a commitment to revisit the topic in the future. The team appreciated the insights shared by Helen, who provided a perspective from another institution, highlighting differences in policy, focus, and the relationship between subject (mentoring) and object (supporting mentorship).
