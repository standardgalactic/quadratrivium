WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.400
Okay, great. I'm seeing lots of people into the room. Fantastic.

00:18.400 --> 00:29.680
Okay, welcome everyone. This must have been a parallel session with two papers. Unfortunately,

00:29.680 --> 00:35.920
our second presenter has fallen prey to this thing that's going around and is unable to join us.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.160
Our second presenter is not well. So we will have only one paper in this session.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.520
If you wish to, after the half hour is over, investigate the other parallel sessions and

00:49.520 --> 00:54.000
join for the last two papers in the middle of the session, that's completely fine. That's what I'm

00:54.000 --> 00:59.600
planning to do. Okay, also to note that this session is being recorded.

01:01.120 --> 01:08.160
Just to emphasize that, I know you've had to click for your permission, but I do feel I should

01:08.160 --> 01:16.320
note it at the beginning. Okay, so to introduce our last speaker standing, Helen Hooper from

01:16.320 --> 01:22.080
Northumbria University, who will be talking about enhancing university mentoring practice

01:22.080 --> 01:26.960
directly theory analysis of lived experiences of learning and teaching mentors.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.760
So Helen, handing over to you now.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.640
Okay, so I'm just sharing my slides. We did a tech check, so hopefully this is yes.

01:44.640 --> 01:51.120
So I'm assuming unless somebody shows, they can't see anything. I'm assuming the slide is still okay.

01:51.120 --> 01:58.160
So I'm absolutely delighted to be here and unaffected by the seasonal thank goodness.

01:59.040 --> 02:05.280
And for the next 20 minutes or so, I'll be presenting on behalf of my wonderful collaborative

02:05.280 --> 02:10.640
team members at Northumbria University. And what I'm going to be aiming to do is to discuss

02:10.640 --> 02:17.680
some initial findings of an ongoing collaborative project. And my wonderful collaborative team

02:17.680 --> 02:23.040
members are all from across the university, from different faculties, different departments,

02:23.040 --> 02:28.800
including staff from a central quality enhancement team. But we've got this shared goal of really

02:28.800 --> 02:34.720
trying to dig in and explore the experiences of staff across the Institute who mentor their

02:34.720 --> 02:39.120
colleagues to develop their teaching activity. And we've got to share this shared goal, this

02:39.120 --> 02:46.000
shared interest, because we're really motivated to try and improve the support and recognition

02:46.000 --> 02:52.960
for teaching and learning mentors. It builds on a previous project and I can dig into that as we go

02:52.960 --> 02:59.600
through the presentation. So in terms of some kind of general scene setting, I don't think it would be

02:59.600 --> 03:06.160
too controversial to say that mentoring to help colleagues develop their teaching and learning

03:06.160 --> 03:12.160
practices is considered pretty important, pretty essential. And there are a number of studies

03:12.160 --> 03:18.720
which have really attempted to look at the impacts of mentoring colleagues to support

03:18.720 --> 03:24.640
their teaching development. And those research studies which have focused on looking at the

03:24.640 --> 03:31.120
impacts, there's a general consensus that really mentoring those colleagues really enhances

03:31.120 --> 03:36.720
the quality of the learning and teaching that results. Too many ways and there's a

03:36.720 --> 03:46.480
various studies that have dug into various aspects. So they help colleagues to develop

03:46.480 --> 03:52.320
their understanding and their knowledge about learning and teaching in general. But also and

03:52.320 --> 03:58.480
importantly, it facilitates that knowledge transfer. So does that knowledge and understanding of

03:58.480 --> 04:06.640
how learning and teaching best practice works, does it facilitate that to be actually incorporated

04:06.960 --> 04:13.440
in colleagues practice and it does. And if anybody is interested in this, in the citations here,

04:13.440 --> 04:19.280
I've put in a really useful systematic review of the literature looking at how mentoring for

04:19.280 --> 04:25.840
teaching and learning enhances the quality of learning and teaching that results. Now in

04:25.840 --> 04:32.240
complete contrast, there's a real gap in the literature and there's very little research

04:32.320 --> 04:39.360
that actually focuses on their mental experiences and their perceptions about mentoring. So

04:39.360 --> 04:46.000
what motivates people to become a learning and teaching mentor? What are the values and

04:46.000 --> 04:52.320
depending engagement? Do learning and teaching mentors perceive existing supports effective?

04:54.160 --> 04:58.640
Do they perceive their learning and teaching mentor enrolers valued within their team,

04:58.640 --> 05:05.360
within their discipline, within the department or across the institute more generally? And I

05:05.360 --> 05:12.640
suppose our starting point for this is mentoring is really underdeveloped as a pedagogical approach

05:12.640 --> 05:17.200
for enhancing teaching. The literature out there suggests that mentoring really does enhance

05:17.200 --> 05:23.840
teaching. But if we know very little about what mentors experiences and perceptions are, then

05:24.320 --> 05:29.440
that's a real kind of target I suppose for us as academic developers and educational

05:29.440 --> 05:36.400
developers more generally to try and target in and enhance support and enhance recognition

05:36.400 --> 05:43.040
for our mentoring colleagues. So that's our shared goal. So in terms of setting the scene then,

05:43.840 --> 05:50.240
I'm just one of a larger group of 11 brilliant colleagues and we've come from all faculties

05:50.240 --> 05:55.280
at my institute, a wide range of departments including colleagues in the central quality

05:55.280 --> 06:01.440
enhancement team. So it really is an interdisciplinary group. We're all really, really quite experienced

06:02.080 --> 06:06.720
learning and teaching mentors. We provide training across the institute and within

06:06.720 --> 06:13.360
our department as well as acting as mentors ourselves. And this builds upon a previous

06:13.360 --> 06:21.040
research project which focused on trying to improve the support for new academic staff

06:21.680 --> 06:29.040
being inducted into learning and teaching. And what came out of that project were a whole range

06:29.040 --> 06:36.560
of things which did result in improved practice and process. But what came out of that in particular

06:36.560 --> 06:43.280
was the central role that new academic staff perceived mentoring to have on an effective

06:43.280 --> 06:48.720
induction into teaching and learning experience. And the other thing that came out of this side

06:48.720 --> 06:55.840
by side, so mentoring is really important for a new staff member to feel really happy and supported

06:57.440 --> 07:02.240
for that induction process to be effective, but also how inconsistent it was and how uneven and

07:02.320 --> 07:08.640
how different the experiences of new academic staff were across the university in terms of the

07:08.640 --> 07:14.560
mentors they were given, in terms of the type of mentoring and all sorts of things. So that always

07:14.560 --> 07:18.320
remained with us and we thought right the next project we really need to try and do is to dig

07:18.320 --> 07:23.120
into the mentor and aspect to really get that improved as well. So in terms of research James

07:23.120 --> 07:27.520
then we want to really dig in and understand the perceptions of learning and teaching and mentoring

07:27.520 --> 07:34.000
amongst mentors themselves, to identify contradictions, inconsistencies and evenness

07:34.000 --> 07:40.400
in mentoring across the institute and to use these findings as a good evidence basis for proposing

07:40.400 --> 07:44.960
changes to both policy and practice across the institute to improve the support we give to

07:44.960 --> 07:50.560
mentors and to really make sure that their excellent mentoring activities is properly recognised.

07:51.760 --> 07:56.800
Now I mentioned this project builds upon a previous project exploring the induction

07:56.800 --> 08:03.440
experiences of new academic staff and we've utilised the same methodological approach because

08:03.440 --> 08:10.880
it is so good and it always surprises me how the chat, so collaborative historical activity theory

08:10.880 --> 08:16.560
in my opinion, should be used far more widely especially for collaborative research projects

08:16.560 --> 08:24.000
in higher education. It is just so useful and it just fits the bill so brilliantly if your aim

08:24.000 --> 08:33.040
is to really try and drive forward change. So it's a theory which encompasses expansive learning

08:33.040 --> 08:40.000
amongst the collaborative team so it really challenges collaborators to question the notions

08:40.000 --> 08:47.440
of your academic agency in terms of suggestion improvements as a basis for change and it's

08:47.440 --> 08:52.720
all about transformation through collaborative reflection. Now this might sound a little bit

08:52.720 --> 08:59.200
complicated if you've not come across this before. So chat, cultural historical activity theory,

08:59.840 --> 09:07.200
it focuses on socially situated learning so thinking about everyday tasks so in this case

09:07.200 --> 09:12.640
we're focusing on the experiences of learning and teaching mentors to try and identify ways to

09:12.640 --> 09:18.160
improve support for them and to increase recognition for the brilliant role that they do

09:18.560 --> 09:26.240
and we do that by setting out and mapping a specific activity system for mentoring. So an

09:26.240 --> 09:32.720
activity system is defined through six interconnected elements which are listed on the bottom of the

09:32.720 --> 09:38.640
slide here so this is a bit of a busy slide. The next slide shows this in terms of an image so if

09:38.640 --> 09:44.560
it looks a bit confusing here hopefully it'll be a little bit clearer in the next slide. So there is

09:44.560 --> 09:50.720
a subject of any activity system and we sat down as a collaborative team and mapped this out for

09:50.720 --> 09:56.000
learning and teaching mentoring so the subject of our activity system is the learning and teaching

09:56.000 --> 10:03.600
mental. The subject engages in an object of activity so here the activity is effective,

10:03.600 --> 10:07.280
we defined it as effective mentoring for learning and teaching in higher education

10:07.920 --> 10:13.920
and obviously that activity occurs within some kind of community so is that predominantly

10:13.920 --> 10:20.160
within a department or a discipline or do actually effective mentors rely in part or predominantly

10:20.160 --> 10:27.920
on interdisciplinary or institutional networks or communities of practice. These are very

10:27.920 --> 10:33.360
sociocultural in nature and the remaining three elements of the activity system on the right

10:33.360 --> 10:38.560
hand side of the bottom of this slide are much more structural or institutional in nature so

10:38.640 --> 10:45.120
you've got a mentor engaging in mentoring in the community but that is mediated often by

10:45.120 --> 10:52.080
institutionally dictated tools and resources so for example what training or CPD is available

10:52.080 --> 10:58.800
for new mentors is there any further training available for experienced mentors and so on.

10:59.440 --> 11:05.920
There are rules defining that activity so for example many institutions have targets for

11:05.920 --> 11:11.280
new academic staff to achieve fellowship of advanced HE and there's a formal process of

11:11.280 --> 11:16.880
allocating that new staff member a trained mentor to guide them through that process

11:17.600 --> 11:22.640
and obviously then there's lots of conflicts and contradictions in terms of how many things

11:22.640 --> 11:28.880
do people have to do so the division of labour for example is there a workload allocated

11:28.880 --> 11:34.960
for that formal mentoring and how is all of the excellent informal mentoring that occurs

11:34.960 --> 11:41.920
allocated for in terms of division of labour so if that previous slide was a little bit busy

11:41.920 --> 11:46.640
maybe this slide makes it a little bit clearer so you can see two triangles there's a large one on

11:46.640 --> 11:52.960
the outside and a smaller one on the inside the sociocultural elements of this activity system

11:53.520 --> 12:00.800
the subject a mentor engaging in the object of the activity system which is effective mentoring

12:01.760 --> 12:06.560
for to support colleagues develop their learning and teaching and that's within a community so it

12:06.560 --> 12:13.360
might be a departmental or institutional community and then that sits within this outer triangle

12:13.360 --> 12:18.400
the three remaining most structural elements of the activity system so what are the rules what are

12:18.400 --> 12:24.400
the tools and resources and you know this contradiction in terms of time available so how

12:24.400 --> 12:30.000
do you spend your time what's the division of labour so we sat down as a collaborative team

12:30.000 --> 12:34.800
we mapped out the activity system and then in terms of generating data and how we progressed

12:34.800 --> 12:40.640
with the analysis each individual team member spent quite a lot of time writing an individual vignette

12:41.200 --> 12:46.960
about how learning and teaching mentoring occurred within their team or their discipline

12:46.960 --> 12:51.360
but i'm from the development of an online survey we use the JISC online survey to

12:51.360 --> 12:56.320
that contain both quantitative and open-ended questions so for example the quantitative questions

12:56.320 --> 13:01.920
you get a workload how much of a workload you get and then open-ended questions such as do you

13:01.920 --> 13:07.120
perceive your mentor learning and teaching mentoring role as valued what are the challenges

13:07.120 --> 13:12.800
or the benefits associated with it and so on and in terms of the analysis it's very intuitive back

13:12.800 --> 13:17.840
and forth between the data the activity system to make sure that the theme codes were organized

13:17.840 --> 13:23.200
around the nodes of the activity system and really focusing on surfacing typical patterns

13:23.280 --> 13:30.560
and contradictions because then we can use those as the basis for improvements to institutional

13:30.560 --> 13:39.360
policy and procedure just checking the time oh i want to spend some time on the findings so again

13:39.360 --> 13:43.120
this might be a little bit of a busy slide and i'll give you a little bit of time to to read

13:43.120 --> 13:50.720
these kinds of typical themes and contradictions that the our team my team has come together

13:51.280 --> 13:59.440
to consider and let's start at the left hand side here not one respondent to the survey

13:59.440 --> 14:04.560
had ever been asked so these are really experienced mentors from across the university and i'm sure

14:04.560 --> 14:10.160
us hopefully i'm well i'm i'm guessing that some people in in the audience today have engaged in

14:10.160 --> 14:17.040
mentorship for teaching and learning have you ever been asked yourself as a practitioner

14:17.760 --> 14:23.200
is the support for mentoring effective and do you think your role is valued do you get a work

14:23.200 --> 14:28.720
load not one of our participants had ever been asked the basic questions about that really

14:28.720 --> 14:35.680
valuable role before now on the flip side i was really surprised by how happy and collegiate

14:35.680 --> 14:42.240
people were to engage in this kind of role and there was some conflict and and contradictions

14:42.240 --> 14:50.480
in terms of respondents and perceptions about whether or not you should be mentoring for a

14:50.480 --> 14:56.640
whole academic at my institute at many institutes mentoring mentoring for learning and teaching

14:56.640 --> 15:03.040
is separate and distinct including a separate person for learning and teaching as opposed to

15:03.040 --> 15:09.280
research and there are various reasons for that and conflict and contradictions in terms of whether

15:09.280 --> 15:14.080
or not that's perceived to be effective or whether on balance mentoring for for the whole

15:14.080 --> 15:22.640
academic is an ideal that we should maybe be trying to work towards um uh then this is an

15:22.640 --> 15:28.000
interesting one there is some assumption and i think i was guilty of this myself that if you're

15:28.000 --> 15:34.800
good at something so if you were if you're an effective teacher then you'd be an effective

15:34.800 --> 15:40.080
mentor in helping colleagues develop their teaching practice and that is probably not so

15:40.080 --> 15:47.040
true and in terms of the institutional support for uh mentor training it's very much focused

15:47.040 --> 15:53.200
on helping new and relatively inexperienced colleagues gain fellowship or granted cheap

15:53.200 --> 16:01.280
because that's the institutional kpi associated with with um with activity very little uh development

16:01.280 --> 16:04.560
for example for colleagues who need to be working in professional practice

16:05.200 --> 16:13.040
so lots of really rich data coming in from both the vignettes and the surveys for mentors across

16:13.040 --> 16:20.080
the university now just just in order to spend a few moments on some initial reflections and

16:20.080 --> 16:27.600
learnings again the the chat theory it really has promoted expansive learning amongst our

16:27.600 --> 16:32.400
collaborative team and at the moment we're sitting down and we're in the process of thinking

16:32.400 --> 16:38.960
through the implications in terms of suggestions and things we want to take forward to really try

16:38.960 --> 16:45.840
and improve the institutional support and the recognition for our brilliant uh learning teaching

16:45.840 --> 16:53.200
mentors so something we really need do need to work on is to get to a reasonable level of

16:53.280 --> 16:59.680
recognition and reward especially in formal processes and procedures so for example promotional

16:59.680 --> 17:06.480
processes appraisal process process and things like we've got an institutional scheme for professional

17:06.480 --> 17:12.480
recognition by advanced hg can we embed some criteria therefore senior fellowship or principal

17:12.480 --> 17:17.920
fellowship and we're kicking around ideas as well for a more celebratory approach so can we give some

17:17.920 --> 17:23.520
kind of institutional prize or can there be a small pot of funding for cpdo research and so on

17:24.720 --> 17:30.960
and surprisingly i'm i'm guessing for some of you would be inconsistent mental workload so

17:30.960 --> 17:36.560
some people had to workload others were completely unaware if they did and if they did it was hidden

17:36.560 --> 17:41.280
in some kind of workload spreadsheet so there's not even a line on the workload spreadsheet so i

17:41.280 --> 17:47.440
think there is a real need to increase mental workload and to get that implemented a bit more

17:47.440 --> 17:54.800
consistently a really strong feedback in terms of this this really crucial role basically being

17:54.800 --> 18:00.000
invisible especially the informal kind of mentoring that goes on every single day so a reliance on

18:00.000 --> 18:05.520
ongoing above and beyond and professional generosity and something we hadn't thought about was what's

18:05.520 --> 18:11.760
the best mentee and mental pairings should they actually be set determined discipline based into

18:11.760 --> 18:16.480
discipline based and that's something that we're going to think about and i really like colleagues

18:16.480 --> 18:21.040
feedback and ideas on any of these so if there's an opportunity for me to to steal some good practice

18:21.040 --> 18:26.320
i'm definitely going to do that and take it back to to um my colleagues at Northumbria um there's

18:26.320 --> 18:31.920
definitely an unmet need for a little bit of extra training especially for mentors who are helping

18:31.920 --> 18:38.560
colleagues develop their practice for professional practice rather than just teaching at a university

18:38.560 --> 18:47.280
kind of standard approaches and what also came out of this was how much mentors gain from mentoring

18:47.280 --> 18:57.280
mentees who have brilliant knowledge to share and especially things like digital literacy so i'm

18:57.280 --> 19:04.000
currently mentoring a relatively new staff who has very little teaching experiences but absolutely

19:04.000 --> 19:10.160
fantastic on generative AI an area which i know very very little about so i think we do have capacity

19:10.160 --> 19:16.400
here to promote the benefits and to capture the benefits of reciprocal mentoring regardless of

19:16.400 --> 19:24.320
status or prior experience or anything along those lines so i think with just maybe one or two minutes

19:24.320 --> 19:31.840
left i'm probably going to end there and i really really welcome any comments or questions or any

19:31.840 --> 19:34.880
good practice that you'd like to share

19:47.680 --> 19:53.840
i'm getting my screen back um thank you very much that was a really interesting presentation

19:54.400 --> 20:04.640
um if anyone has any questions in the uh who in the attendance list here please do let me know

20:04.640 --> 20:11.520
pop it in the chat or just raise your your hand electronically i was really interested Helen in

20:11.520 --> 20:19.600
that last slide um where you were talking about um the uh the potential benefits um and you were

20:19.600 --> 20:27.280
talking about the the mentor mentee pairings and how these might be rethought how the organization

20:27.280 --> 20:32.960
of those might be rethought and i was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how those are

20:32.960 --> 20:39.440
currently arranged at Northumbria does it vary across department or yeah so it'll be really

20:39.440 --> 20:43.520
just again to get other people's kind of perspectives on this so at Northumbria even

20:43.520 --> 20:49.200
though it's a reasonably large and quite complex kind of organization and my own faculty is split

20:49.200 --> 20:53.360
on two different campuses really quite large deeper mental and discipline based teams

20:54.080 --> 20:57.840
we still have this kind of one we have this notional one university approach

20:59.040 --> 21:03.120
but then when you actually dig in and actually go and have a look at what happens in departments

21:03.120 --> 21:08.240
and discipline teams it's clearly not a one university approach so what's really nice about

21:08.240 --> 21:13.200
doing these kinds of projects is to actually find out what happens in reality regardless of the

21:13.200 --> 21:19.360
notional one university approach to processes and practices so in my own department i allocate

21:19.360 --> 21:26.000
formal mentors to new academic staff and what i generally tend to do is to allocate a mentor from

21:26.000 --> 21:30.480
outside the direct program or disability team because then there's no kind of conflicts of

21:30.480 --> 21:35.760
interest in terms of a bit of teaching practice going on and you also get opportunity to share

21:35.760 --> 21:42.800
good practice across the department more generally it also gives new academic members of staff a wider

21:42.800 --> 21:46.960
network outside their initial disability team because they can draw on expertise and they get to

21:46.960 --> 21:53.200
know people from other programs or other areas but that's very different to other departments

21:53.200 --> 21:59.040
and disciplines so in some of the more professionally oriented departments and programs there's very

21:59.040 --> 22:05.600
much an allocate from that specific discipline area because there's niche knowledge that's really

22:05.600 --> 22:12.320
helpful for the new academic staff member to to get on board with and to understand so

22:12.880 --> 22:19.040
i'm not so sure that there's a correct answer to that but it's not something that i ever thought

22:19.040 --> 22:25.120
about before and what i did after thinking about this because this came out of the data analysis

22:25.120 --> 22:29.840
was take this back to my own departmental teaching and learning enhancement team and say

22:29.840 --> 22:33.360
look we've always done this in the past but there's these other ways of thinking about

22:33.360 --> 22:40.240
things and doing things shall we try something new or actually if it's not broken shall we not fix it

22:40.240 --> 22:44.080
so i think what's good about this approach and what's good about this method

22:44.080 --> 22:50.400
is it stimulates that discussion and that collaborative reflection and it also i find

22:50.400 --> 22:56.240
this so valuable myself it's about the academic agency you are the captain of your own destiny

22:56.240 --> 23:00.880
what are we going to do as a team to try and make things a bit better for everybody

23:02.080 --> 23:06.960
so that was that was a bit of a long winded answer did i answer your question

23:07.920 --> 23:13.600
no it's all it's just all really interesting isn't it i mean um yeah that that perspective is

23:13.600 --> 23:20.560
is really interesting um i see that richard davies has his hand raised would you like to

23:20.560 --> 23:29.520
post your question and yeah thanks very much um my question really is about um the design of the

23:29.600 --> 23:37.760
chat system and i i guess my question is is to what extent the data confirms this kind of

23:38.320 --> 23:44.320
setting out of it or whether there are multiple ways in which the activity system could be laid

23:44.320 --> 23:50.560
out in relation both i think to the different kinds of communities and different rules um

23:50.560 --> 23:57.440
but also whether or not um how you think about what the um the object is and the output of them

23:58.240 --> 24:05.040
and to what extent it feeds into the activity um system of teaching and learning itself

24:05.600 --> 24:10.400
um and i just i just wondered where you had thoughts about whether this was a

24:11.600 --> 24:17.520
where this was a kind of a strong activity this theoretically strong activity system or

24:17.520 --> 24:22.160
whether it was it was a kind of a heuristic and there were alternatives that might also

24:22.880 --> 24:29.600
fit the data thanks yeah richard so i i think this is this i think we could talk about that for

24:29.600 --> 24:35.360
probably about an hour or something so um this is the second project that i've been involved with

24:35.360 --> 24:40.640
with which utilised the activity system and this chat approach and i come from a kind of hard

24:40.640 --> 24:46.640
science background so my background is a molecular biologist um and a colleague of mine

24:46.640 --> 24:51.360
Sue Matheson who's in the central quality enhancement team is an educational developer

24:51.360 --> 24:58.160
by practice and by research so she really led on on teaching us and um developing our knowledge

24:58.160 --> 25:02.800
and understanding of this approach so that's the caveat to what i'm going to say i've been

25:02.800 --> 25:07.840
involved with it for about five years we've done a couple of projects but i don't really consider

25:07.840 --> 25:12.000
myself to be an expert in the field i'm kind of more of a practitioner i put it in putting it

25:12.080 --> 25:18.480
into practice i think i think about it as a really valuable tool both for data generation

25:18.480 --> 25:23.840
and analysis but also for personal and practitioner educational development so i think i gain as much

25:23.840 --> 25:29.600
out of it as what we learn from the participants responses and so on so to try and answer your

25:29.600 --> 25:38.400
question a bit more focused so um with this activity system the one i presented is probably

25:38.480 --> 25:43.520
about both iteration so we go away we have a thing we come back and we draft it out and

25:43.520 --> 25:48.000
then we talk about it and then we go away we have a thing about it in practice we come back

25:48.000 --> 25:54.080
and we talk about it and so um we get to a stage as a collaborative team so there's 11 of us from

25:54.080 --> 26:00.400
all four faculties from eight different departments um 10 different disciplines on a central team

26:00.400 --> 26:06.880
and we've got that breadth so i suppose a weakness if you can call it a weakness is i think it would

26:06.880 --> 26:14.400
be much more tighter and focused if i define that within my department but i think that weakness is

26:14.400 --> 26:18.560
also a strength because if you're trying to develop and improve support and recognition

26:18.560 --> 26:24.240
for colleagues who engage in mentorship across the university you do have to have that that kind of

26:24.240 --> 26:30.960
the breadth so i if i remember correctly that's about the fourth iteration that we agreed upon

26:30.960 --> 26:37.760
where it was general enough to reflect everybody's practice and understanding but tight enough

26:37.760 --> 26:46.400
to be useful as a tool for data analysis and then reflection and the focus of this i think is to

26:46.400 --> 26:52.160
identify those common experiences and contradictions because that's the basis on which then you say

26:52.160 --> 26:56.880
this is what we do reasonably well and we should fight and argue to keep that going but actually

26:56.880 --> 27:01.520
these are things that are unhelpful because they're different in different departments and

27:01.520 --> 27:06.960
there's unmet need for training or it gives you some ideas for things that you haven't tried out

27:06.960 --> 27:13.440
before there could be a bit better in your own department um so i think if you take that here's

27:13.440 --> 27:19.360
my feeling i think if you take that and maybe try and apply it at your own institute you plan

27:19.360 --> 27:24.240
i'm guessing that you would come to something pretty similar if you did it across your institute

27:24.880 --> 27:30.320
if you did it in a tighter team it might be a bit different does does that make sense does that answer

27:30.320 --> 27:35.520
your question or not have you experienced of it or would you would you say something different

27:35.520 --> 27:41.520
it'll be really interesting to find out no i think i think i think i guess uh no timber and you can

27:41.520 --> 27:47.440
be similar in the sense that we have quite centralized teaching and learning um policies

27:47.440 --> 27:53.920
and framework so i guess across the institution um i i would think it would be interesting to see

27:53.920 --> 27:58.960
what it would look like at say some of the you know that's based at one of the kind of more

27:58.960 --> 28:05.920
entrepreneurial universities that's um uh where um departments are actually quite distinct in terms of

28:05.920 --> 28:13.120
their culture and activity um and potentially more driven by um the academic discipline than

28:13.120 --> 28:18.880
perhaps many of our schools are because they're primarily driven by more vocational occupational

28:19.760 --> 28:26.960
concerns um so i guess there would be similarities i think might i think where we might look at

28:26.960 --> 28:33.680
differently is is whether we're actually whether we're trying to provide if whether the outcome is

28:33.680 --> 28:39.600
providing effective mentoring or whether it's about providing effective teaching learning

28:39.600 --> 28:46.320
within particular schools so um so that we that so that the effective mentoring will be a kind of

28:46.320 --> 28:53.920
mediating uh feature i think for us as opposed and that's partly because we're driven by as many

28:53.920 --> 29:01.120
are by rfs requirements in terms of theory of change and impact upon student metrics and so

29:01.680 --> 29:09.040
quite a lot of what we do see the kind of work with staff as as mediating the actual goal which is

29:09.040 --> 29:14.640
the improvements of learning and to some extent teaching kind of almost drops out as a as a final

29:15.120 --> 29:20.480
so what you're doing what you're doing there is is i'm getting deja vu that was our first conversation

29:21.120 --> 29:24.800
so how tight should be the relationship between the subject and the object

29:24.800 --> 29:29.760
and we ended up as quite a tight relationship because if it's mentors it has to be support for

29:29.760 --> 29:36.160
mentoring and not everything else because that's a bit too broad um so so that's that's that but

29:36.160 --> 29:41.360
you go through those cycles as a team to say and to divine it so it's quite a time consuming process

29:41.360 --> 29:46.320
but it's very valuable because it really makes you unpick and think about things that you might

29:46.320 --> 29:50.400
either haven't thought about since you were a new mentor or you'd never thought about before

29:52.640 --> 29:53.200
hey thanks

29:55.200 --> 30:00.400
um was there a question in the chat player i've not been keeping an eye on no um one of the

30:00.400 --> 30:05.760
questions just want to leave yeah yeah and we're thanking you for for a great session um

30:06.480 --> 30:12.720
were there any other questions in the room otherwise i think we can all exit and go on

30:12.720 --> 30:18.000
through another session but um Helen thank you very much that was really interesting uh you're

30:18.000 --> 30:24.240
your perspective on that um i think it's really interesting work so we'd love to hear back from

30:24.240 --> 30:28.800
you again yeah well thanks for listening and thanks thanks for the input it's fantastic

30:29.680 --> 30:34.960
excellent okay and we'll see you again soon yeah brilliant thanks very much bye everybody

30:34.960 --> 30:38.160
bye now
