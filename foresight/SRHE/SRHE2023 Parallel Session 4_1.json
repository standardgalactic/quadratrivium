{"text": " Okay, great. I'm seeing lots of people into the room. Fantastic. Okay, welcome everyone. This must have been a parallel session with two papers. Unfortunately, our second presenter has fallen prey to this thing that's going around and is unable to join us. Our second presenter is not well. So we will have only one paper in this session. If you wish to, after the half hour is over, investigate the other parallel sessions and join for the last two papers in the middle of the session, that's completely fine. That's what I'm planning to do. Okay, also to note that this session is being recorded. Just to emphasize that, I know you've had to click for your permission, but I do feel I should note it at the beginning. Okay, so to introduce our last speaker standing, Helen Hooper from Northumbria University, who will be talking about enhancing university mentoring practice directly theory analysis of lived experiences of learning and teaching mentors. So Helen, handing over to you now. Okay, so I'm just sharing my slides. We did a tech check, so hopefully this is yes. So I'm assuming unless somebody shows, they can't see anything. I'm assuming the slide is still okay. So I'm absolutely delighted to be here and unaffected by the seasonal thank goodness. And for the next 20 minutes or so, I'll be presenting on behalf of my wonderful collaborative team members at Northumbria University. And what I'm going to be aiming to do is to discuss some initial findings of an ongoing collaborative project. And my wonderful collaborative team members are all from across the university, from different faculties, different departments, including staff from a central quality enhancement team. But we've got this shared goal of really trying to dig in and explore the experiences of staff across the Institute who mentor their colleagues to develop their teaching activity. And we've got to share this shared goal, this shared interest, because we're really motivated to try and improve the support and recognition for teaching and learning mentors. It builds on a previous project and I can dig into that as we go through the presentation. So in terms of some kind of general scene setting, I don't think it would be too controversial to say that mentoring to help colleagues develop their teaching and learning practices is considered pretty important, pretty essential. And there are a number of studies which have really attempted to look at the impacts of mentoring colleagues to support their teaching development. And those research studies which have focused on looking at the impacts, there's a general consensus that really mentoring those colleagues really enhances the quality of the learning and teaching that results. Too many ways and there's a various studies that have dug into various aspects. So they help colleagues to develop their understanding and their knowledge about learning and teaching in general. But also and importantly, it facilitates that knowledge transfer. So does that knowledge and understanding of how learning and teaching best practice works, does it facilitate that to be actually incorporated in colleagues practice and it does. And if anybody is interested in this, in the citations here, I've put in a really useful systematic review of the literature looking at how mentoring for teaching and learning enhances the quality of learning and teaching that results. Now in complete contrast, there's a real gap in the literature and there's very little research that actually focuses on their mental experiences and their perceptions about mentoring. So what motivates people to become a learning and teaching mentor? What are the values and depending engagement? Do learning and teaching mentors perceive existing supports effective? Do they perceive their learning and teaching mentor enrolers valued within their team, within their discipline, within the department or across the institute more generally? And I suppose our starting point for this is mentoring is really underdeveloped as a pedagogical approach for enhancing teaching. The literature out there suggests that mentoring really does enhance teaching. But if we know very little about what mentors experiences and perceptions are, then that's a real kind of target I suppose for us as academic developers and educational developers more generally to try and target in and enhance support and enhance recognition for our mentoring colleagues. So that's our shared goal. So in terms of setting the scene then, I'm just one of a larger group of 11 brilliant colleagues and we've come from all faculties at my institute, a wide range of departments including colleagues in the central quality enhancement team. So it really is an interdisciplinary group. We're all really, really quite experienced learning and teaching mentors. We provide training across the institute and within our department as well as acting as mentors ourselves. And this builds upon a previous research project which focused on trying to improve the support for new academic staff being inducted into learning and teaching. And what came out of that project were a whole range of things which did result in improved practice and process. But what came out of that in particular was the central role that new academic staff perceived mentoring to have on an effective induction into teaching and learning experience. And the other thing that came out of this side by side, so mentoring is really important for a new staff member to feel really happy and supported for that induction process to be effective, but also how inconsistent it was and how uneven and how different the experiences of new academic staff were across the university in terms of the mentors they were given, in terms of the type of mentoring and all sorts of things. So that always remained with us and we thought right the next project we really need to try and do is to dig into the mentor and aspect to really get that improved as well. So in terms of research James then we want to really dig in and understand the perceptions of learning and teaching and mentoring amongst mentors themselves, to identify contradictions, inconsistencies and evenness in mentoring across the institute and to use these findings as a good evidence basis for proposing changes to both policy and practice across the institute to improve the support we give to mentors and to really make sure that their excellent mentoring activities is properly recognised. Now I mentioned this project builds upon a previous project exploring the induction experiences of new academic staff and we've utilised the same methodological approach because it is so good and it always surprises me how the chat, so collaborative historical activity theory in my opinion, should be used far more widely especially for collaborative research projects in higher education. It is just so useful and it just fits the bill so brilliantly if your aim is to really try and drive forward change. So it's a theory which encompasses expansive learning amongst the collaborative team so it really challenges collaborators to question the notions of your academic agency in terms of suggestion improvements as a basis for change and it's all about transformation through collaborative reflection. Now this might sound a little bit complicated if you've not come across this before. So chat, cultural historical activity theory, it focuses on socially situated learning so thinking about everyday tasks so in this case we're focusing on the experiences of learning and teaching mentors to try and identify ways to improve support for them and to increase recognition for the brilliant role that they do and we do that by setting out and mapping a specific activity system for mentoring. So an activity system is defined through six interconnected elements which are listed on the bottom of the slide here so this is a bit of a busy slide. The next slide shows this in terms of an image so if it looks a bit confusing here hopefully it'll be a little bit clearer in the next slide. So there is a subject of any activity system and we sat down as a collaborative team and mapped this out for learning and teaching mentoring so the subject of our activity system is the learning and teaching mental. The subject engages in an object of activity so here the activity is effective, we defined it as effective mentoring for learning and teaching in higher education and obviously that activity occurs within some kind of community so is that predominantly within a department or a discipline or do actually effective mentors rely in part or predominantly on interdisciplinary or institutional networks or communities of practice. These are very sociocultural in nature and the remaining three elements of the activity system on the right hand side of the bottom of this slide are much more structural or institutional in nature so you've got a mentor engaging in mentoring in the community but that is mediated often by institutionally dictated tools and resources so for example what training or CPD is available for new mentors is there any further training available for experienced mentors and so on. There are rules defining that activity so for example many institutions have targets for new academic staff to achieve fellowship of advanced HE and there's a formal process of allocating that new staff member a trained mentor to guide them through that process and obviously then there's lots of conflicts and contradictions in terms of how many things do people have to do so the division of labour for example is there a workload allocated for that formal mentoring and how is all of the excellent informal mentoring that occurs allocated for in terms of division of labour so if that previous slide was a little bit busy maybe this slide makes it a little bit clearer so you can see two triangles there's a large one on the outside and a smaller one on the inside the sociocultural elements of this activity system the subject a mentor engaging in the object of the activity system which is effective mentoring for to support colleagues develop their learning and teaching and that's within a community so it might be a departmental or institutional community and then that sits within this outer triangle the three remaining most structural elements of the activity system so what are the rules what are the tools and resources and you know this contradiction in terms of time available so how do you spend your time what's the division of labour so we sat down as a collaborative team we mapped out the activity system and then in terms of generating data and how we progressed with the analysis each individual team member spent quite a lot of time writing an individual vignette about how learning and teaching mentoring occurred within their team or their discipline but i'm from the development of an online survey we use the JISC online survey to that contain both quantitative and open-ended questions so for example the quantitative questions you get a workload how much of a workload you get and then open-ended questions such as do you perceive your mentor learning and teaching mentoring role as valued what are the challenges or the benefits associated with it and so on and in terms of the analysis it's very intuitive back and forth between the data the activity system to make sure that the theme codes were organized around the nodes of the activity system and really focusing on surfacing typical patterns and contradictions because then we can use those as the basis for improvements to institutional policy and procedure just checking the time oh i want to spend some time on the findings so again this might be a little bit of a busy slide and i'll give you a little bit of time to to read these kinds of typical themes and contradictions that the our team my team has come together to consider and let's start at the left hand side here not one respondent to the survey had ever been asked so these are really experienced mentors from across the university and i'm sure us hopefully i'm well i'm i'm guessing that some people in in the audience today have engaged in mentorship for teaching and learning have you ever been asked yourself as a practitioner is the support for mentoring effective and do you think your role is valued do you get a work load not one of our participants had ever been asked the basic questions about that really valuable role before now on the flip side i was really surprised by how happy and collegiate people were to engage in this kind of role and there was some conflict and and contradictions in terms of respondents and perceptions about whether or not you should be mentoring for a whole academic at my institute at many institutes mentoring mentoring for learning and teaching is separate and distinct including a separate person for learning and teaching as opposed to research and there are various reasons for that and conflict and contradictions in terms of whether or not that's perceived to be effective or whether on balance mentoring for for the whole academic is an ideal that we should maybe be trying to work towards um uh then this is an interesting one there is some assumption and i think i was guilty of this myself that if you're good at something so if you were if you're an effective teacher then you'd be an effective mentor in helping colleagues develop their teaching practice and that is probably not so true and in terms of the institutional support for uh mentor training it's very much focused on helping new and relatively inexperienced colleagues gain fellowship or granted cheap because that's the institutional kpi associated with with um with activity very little uh development for example for colleagues who need to be working in professional practice so lots of really rich data coming in from both the vignettes and the surveys for mentors across the university now just just in order to spend a few moments on some initial reflections and learnings again the the chat theory it really has promoted expansive learning amongst our collaborative team and at the moment we're sitting down and we're in the process of thinking through the implications in terms of suggestions and things we want to take forward to really try and improve the institutional support and the recognition for our brilliant uh learning teaching mentors so something we really need do need to work on is to get to a reasonable level of recognition and reward especially in formal processes and procedures so for example promotional processes appraisal process process and things like we've got an institutional scheme for professional recognition by advanced hg can we embed some criteria therefore senior fellowship or principal fellowship and we're kicking around ideas as well for a more celebratory approach so can we give some kind of institutional prize or can there be a small pot of funding for cpdo research and so on and surprisingly i'm i'm guessing for some of you would be inconsistent mental workload so some people had to workload others were completely unaware if they did and if they did it was hidden in some kind of workload spreadsheet so there's not even a line on the workload spreadsheet so i think there is a real need to increase mental workload and to get that implemented a bit more consistently a really strong feedback in terms of this this really crucial role basically being invisible especially the informal kind of mentoring that goes on every single day so a reliance on ongoing above and beyond and professional generosity and something we hadn't thought about was what's the best mentee and mental pairings should they actually be set determined discipline based into discipline based and that's something that we're going to think about and i really like colleagues feedback and ideas on any of these so if there's an opportunity for me to to steal some good practice i'm definitely going to do that and take it back to to um my colleagues at Northumbria um there's definitely an unmet need for a little bit of extra training especially for mentors who are helping colleagues develop their practice for professional practice rather than just teaching at a university kind of standard approaches and what also came out of this was how much mentors gain from mentoring mentees who have brilliant knowledge to share and especially things like digital literacy so i'm currently mentoring a relatively new staff who has very little teaching experiences but absolutely fantastic on generative AI an area which i know very very little about so i think we do have capacity here to promote the benefits and to capture the benefits of reciprocal mentoring regardless of status or prior experience or anything along those lines so i think with just maybe one or two minutes left i'm probably going to end there and i really really welcome any comments or questions or any good practice that you'd like to share i'm getting my screen back um thank you very much that was a really interesting presentation um if anyone has any questions in the uh who in the attendance list here please do let me know pop it in the chat or just raise your your hand electronically i was really interested Helen in that last slide um where you were talking about um the uh the potential benefits um and you were talking about the the mentor mentee pairings and how these might be rethought how the organization of those might be rethought and i was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how those are currently arranged at Northumbria does it vary across department or yeah so it'll be really just again to get other people's kind of perspectives on this so at Northumbria even though it's a reasonably large and quite complex kind of organization and my own faculty is split on two different campuses really quite large deeper mental and discipline based teams we still have this kind of one we have this notional one university approach but then when you actually dig in and actually go and have a look at what happens in departments and discipline teams it's clearly not a one university approach so what's really nice about doing these kinds of projects is to actually find out what happens in reality regardless of the notional one university approach to processes and practices so in my own department i allocate formal mentors to new academic staff and what i generally tend to do is to allocate a mentor from outside the direct program or disability team because then there's no kind of conflicts of interest in terms of a bit of teaching practice going on and you also get opportunity to share good practice across the department more generally it also gives new academic members of staff a wider network outside their initial disability team because they can draw on expertise and they get to know people from other programs or other areas but that's very different to other departments and disciplines so in some of the more professionally oriented departments and programs there's very much an allocate from that specific discipline area because there's niche knowledge that's really helpful for the new academic staff member to to get on board with and to understand so i'm not so sure that there's a correct answer to that but it's not something that i ever thought about before and what i did after thinking about this because this came out of the data analysis was take this back to my own departmental teaching and learning enhancement team and say look we've always done this in the past but there's these other ways of thinking about things and doing things shall we try something new or actually if it's not broken shall we not fix it so i think what's good about this approach and what's good about this method is it stimulates that discussion and that collaborative reflection and it also i find this so valuable myself it's about the academic agency you are the captain of your own destiny what are we going to do as a team to try and make things a bit better for everybody so that was that was a bit of a long winded answer did i answer your question no it's all it's just all really interesting isn't it i mean um yeah that that perspective is is really interesting um i see that richard davies has his hand raised would you like to post your question and yeah thanks very much um my question really is about um the design of the chat system and i i guess my question is is to what extent the data confirms this kind of setting out of it or whether there are multiple ways in which the activity system could be laid out in relation both i think to the different kinds of communities and different rules um but also whether or not um how you think about what the um the object is and the output of them and to what extent it feeds into the activity um system of teaching and learning itself um and i just i just wondered where you had thoughts about whether this was a where this was a kind of a strong activity this theoretically strong activity system or whether it was it was a kind of a heuristic and there were alternatives that might also fit the data thanks yeah richard so i i think this is this i think we could talk about that for probably about an hour or something so um this is the second project that i've been involved with with which utilised the activity system and this chat approach and i come from a kind of hard science background so my background is a molecular biologist um and a colleague of mine Sue Matheson who's in the central quality enhancement team is an educational developer by practice and by research so she really led on on teaching us and um developing our knowledge and understanding of this approach so that's the caveat to what i'm going to say i've been involved with it for about five years we've done a couple of projects but i don't really consider myself to be an expert in the field i'm kind of more of a practitioner i put it in putting it into practice i think i think about it as a really valuable tool both for data generation and analysis but also for personal and practitioner educational development so i think i gain as much out of it as what we learn from the participants responses and so on so to try and answer your question a bit more focused so um with this activity system the one i presented is probably about both iteration so we go away we have a thing we come back and we draft it out and then we talk about it and then we go away we have a thing about it in practice we come back and we talk about it and so um we get to a stage as a collaborative team so there's 11 of us from all four faculties from eight different departments um 10 different disciplines on a central team and we've got that breadth so i suppose a weakness if you can call it a weakness is i think it would be much more tighter and focused if i define that within my department but i think that weakness is also a strength because if you're trying to develop and improve support and recognition for colleagues who engage in mentorship across the university you do have to have that that kind of the breadth so i if i remember correctly that's about the fourth iteration that we agreed upon where it was general enough to reflect everybody's practice and understanding but tight enough to be useful as a tool for data analysis and then reflection and the focus of this i think is to identify those common experiences and contradictions because that's the basis on which then you say this is what we do reasonably well and we should fight and argue to keep that going but actually these are things that are unhelpful because they're different in different departments and there's unmet need for training or it gives you some ideas for things that you haven't tried out before there could be a bit better in your own department um so i think if you take that here's my feeling i think if you take that and maybe try and apply it at your own institute you plan i'm guessing that you would come to something pretty similar if you did it across your institute if you did it in a tighter team it might be a bit different does does that make sense does that answer your question or not have you experienced of it or would you would you say something different it'll be really interesting to find out no i think i think i think i guess uh no timber and you can be similar in the sense that we have quite centralized teaching and learning um policies and framework so i guess across the institution um i i would think it would be interesting to see what it would look like at say some of the you know that's based at one of the kind of more entrepreneurial universities that's um uh where um departments are actually quite distinct in terms of their culture and activity um and potentially more driven by um the academic discipline than perhaps many of our schools are because they're primarily driven by more vocational occupational concerns um so i guess there would be similarities i think might i think where we might look at differently is is whether we're actually whether we're trying to provide if whether the outcome is providing effective mentoring or whether it's about providing effective teaching learning within particular schools so um so that we that so that the effective mentoring will be a kind of mediating uh feature i think for us as opposed and that's partly because we're driven by as many are by rfs requirements in terms of theory of change and impact upon student metrics and so quite a lot of what we do see the kind of work with staff as as mediating the actual goal which is the improvements of learning and to some extent teaching kind of almost drops out as a as a final so what you're doing what you're doing there is is i'm getting deja vu that was our first conversation so how tight should be the relationship between the subject and the object and we ended up as quite a tight relationship because if it's mentors it has to be support for mentoring and not everything else because that's a bit too broad um so so that's that's that but you go through those cycles as a team to say and to divine it so it's quite a time consuming process but it's very valuable because it really makes you unpick and think about things that you might either haven't thought about since you were a new mentor or you'd never thought about before hey thanks um was there a question in the chat player i've not been keeping an eye on no um one of the questions just want to leave yeah yeah and we're thanking you for for a great session um were there any other questions in the room otherwise i think we can all exit and go on through another session but um Helen thank you very much that was really interesting uh you're your perspective on that um i think it's really interesting work so we'd love to hear back from you again yeah well thanks for listening and thanks thanks for the input it's fantastic excellent okay and we'll see you again soon
