Checking Universe Inside You/Forbidden Technologies and The Silencing of Their Inventors.txt
1. **Tobacco Product Safety**: A project led by Dr. Philip Mould at Liggett Group in the 1980s aimed to create a safer cigarette. The project, known as Project XA, developed a cigarette with significantly reduced carcinogens. However, due to legal concerns over potential lawsuits from consumers harmed by traditional products and fear of retaliation from other tobacco companies, Liggett decided to abandon the project after investing approximately $10 million over two decades. This decision kept the safer cigarette off the market, leaving consumers exposed to the health risks of conventional cigarettes.

2. **The Hendershot Generator**: Lester Hendershot invented a device in the late 1920s that claimed to generate free energy by harnessing the Earth's magnetic field. His generator allegedly worked without fuel, offering an unlimited source of power. Initial public demonstrations of the device garnered attention and interest, but it faced opposition and discreditation campaigns. Despite this, Hendershot continued his work. In the late 1960s, he believed he had a breakthrough that could interest the U.S. Navy. However, his proposal was denied, and in April 1961, Hendershot was found dead under circumstances that some believe were suspicious, with theories suggesting he was threatened or silenced by large energy corporations due to the potential impact of his invention on their business.

Both stories illustrate how economic and political interests can suppress innovative technologies that could benefit society. They highlight the need for a culture that encourages innovation and values human progress over economic dominance. These narratives serve as reminders of the potential advancements that have been lost due to such suppression, and they underscore the importance of questioning, seeking truths, and advocating for the ethical use of innovations.
