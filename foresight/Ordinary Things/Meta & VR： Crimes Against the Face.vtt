WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.420
Imagine, if you will, a whole new dimension, a brief new world that you can only access

00:08.420 --> 00:15.740
through the medium of a $300 electric blindfold, escape a material world that teeters on ecological

00:15.740 --> 00:21.140
collapse and into a make-believe one where Half-Life 3 came out two years ago.

00:21.140 --> 00:25.780
This virtual world is so immersive that you might not notice when your girlfriend moves

00:25.780 --> 00:28.300
out and takes half the furniture with her.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.380
But don't worry, because the only guys in the metaverse who don't have anime cat

00:32.380 --> 00:35.340
girlfriends are the ones pretending to be them.

00:35.340 --> 00:40.980
But all is not well in this digital paradise, it's being conquered by an artificial intelligence

00:40.980 --> 00:42.820
known as the Zuckerborg.

00:42.820 --> 00:47.180
The Zuckerborg might have convinced you that he birthed the metaverse from his own mind

00:47.180 --> 00:50.900
folds, but its first bricks were laid decades ago.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.140
And if we're going to understand what the metaverse, actually, is, then we're going

00:55.140 --> 01:04.820
to have to understand the dreams and ideals of its reality and deodorant dodging pioneers.

01:04.820 --> 01:09.180
The earliest development in virtual reality actually takes us all the way back to London

01:09.180 --> 01:11.940
in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation.

01:11.940 --> 01:16.860
In 1838, if you wanted to escape the reality in front of your face, you could either visit

01:16.860 --> 01:22.180
an opium den or try out one of Charles Wheatstone's stereoscopes.

01:22.340 --> 01:26.340
Charlie figured out that showing each eye two separate images taken from slightly different

01:26.340 --> 01:31.900
angles gave the illusion of depth, and Victorians first harnessed this eye-tricking tech to

01:31.900 --> 01:34.940
take little head holidays to famous landmarks.

01:34.940 --> 01:40.220
And like nearly all modern VR users, the next thing they wanted to see was some 3D double

01:40.220 --> 01:42.100
Ds.

01:42.100 --> 01:46.940
Stereoscopic pornography was extremely popular, and this would start a trend that we'll see

01:46.940 --> 01:50.420
with pretty much every subsequent virtual reality.

01:50.420 --> 01:54.500
Once someone figured out how to stitch still images together and trick people into thinking

01:54.500 --> 01:58.900
they were going to get hit by a train, the stereoscope was out and cinema was in.

01:58.900 --> 02:04.780
For the next 60 years, a flat screen in a dark room was immersive enough for these 20th century

02:04.780 --> 02:05.780
simpletons.

02:05.780 --> 02:08.220
So there was no need to strap anything to your head.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.980
That was until 1962, when one man was brave enough to ask the question, what if you could

02:13.980 --> 02:15.420
smell movies too?

02:16.420 --> 02:24.100
Morton Highlig was the inventor of the Sensorama machine.

02:24.100 --> 02:28.100
And while its patent diagram might make you think it was designed to cook your head like

02:28.100 --> 02:33.860
a succulent, microwavable meal, it was actually an immersive cinema experience.

02:33.860 --> 02:40.380
In the Sensorama, your head could see, feel and smell five whole films, all farted straight

02:40.380 --> 02:42.380
from Morton's own mind box.

02:43.100 --> 02:55.220
And here, Morton is still leagues ahead of modern VR, where the only thing I can smell

02:55.220 --> 02:59.260
is my own sweaty pits after a vigorous beat saver session.

02:59.260 --> 03:03.060
These though were just the first evolutionary steps in VR.

03:03.060 --> 03:08.460
The hunched over head mounted monkeys who had to walk before we could run straight into

03:08.460 --> 03:09.460
our living room wall.

03:12.380 --> 03:20.140
But in the same year that man walked on the moon, a computer scientist was taking the

03:20.140 --> 03:22.980
first giant leap into virtual reality.

03:22.980 --> 03:28.820
Ivan created a headset attached to a ceiling mounted system called the Sword of Damocles,

03:28.820 --> 03:32.980
which allowed the user to see a virtual environment from different angles without snapping their

03:32.980 --> 03:34.140
neck in half.

03:34.140 --> 03:38.740
While Ivan could be considered the daddy of VR as we know it, his metaverse was nothing

03:38.740 --> 03:43.260
more than a single wire-framed room, which he modestly showed off in this lecture from

03:43.260 --> 03:44.260
1996.

03:56.260 --> 04:02.780
As virtual reality became a reality, its pioneers had to cook up real-world reasons for the

04:02.780 --> 04:06.780
government to spend millions on their made-up fantasy worlds.

04:06.820 --> 04:12.060
By 1985, NASA had given up on sending people to the moon, but they still had enough cash

04:12.060 --> 04:15.860
to spaff on VR motorcycle helmets.

04:15.860 --> 04:20.660
NASA believed these headsets would be used to control robotic vehicles and that VR itself

04:20.660 --> 04:26.140
would be a sort of virtual workstation and three-dimensional data space.

04:26.140 --> 04:31.820
While NASA was limited by the technology of its era, virtual reality was being fully explored

04:31.820 --> 04:33.820
in 1980s fiction.

04:33.820 --> 04:39.900
In 1984, William Gibson published Neuromancer, the first of three novels set in the sprawl,

04:39.900 --> 04:46.140
a science fiction world where drug-addled, sex-mad console cowboys entered a cyberspace

04:46.140 --> 04:49.500
matrix to take on different physical forms.

04:49.500 --> 04:55.740
An anime from 1985 called Megazone 23 also beat the Matrix to the punch with its whole

04:55.740 --> 05:00.580
— actually, you're living in a computer simulation twist — complete with black-suited

05:00.580 --> 05:04.060
agents, computer-simulated women, and some familiar dialogue.

05:13.060 --> 05:18.580
Back in the real world, though, a video game developer and white dude with dreads named

05:18.580 --> 05:22.900
Jaron Lanier was about to push us hard into the Matrix.

05:22.900 --> 05:28.140
After making a ton of cash from developing games like Moondust for the Commodore 64,

05:28.220 --> 05:35.020
Jaron started VPL, Virtual Programming Languages, a company that jump-started the first age

05:35.020 --> 05:41.580
of consumer-focused virtual reality, with products like the Data Glove and the iPhone.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.580
That's eye-like-eye.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.580
That wasn't clear.

05:45.580 --> 05:50.580
Finally, allowing users to finger the blocky inhabitants of the same virtual dimension

05:50.580 --> 05:54.580
where those 90s bowling alley animations must have come from.

05:54.580 --> 05:59.020
If you wanted to slip on a Data Glove, though, it would have cost you about eight grand.

05:59.020 --> 06:04.780
And that doesn't include the $200,000 computer you'd have needed to run a simulation on

06:04.780 --> 06:05.780
an iPhone.

06:05.780 --> 06:13.340
Jaron was, and remains, a dreamer who had deep insights about where the future was going.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.620
And he was as stubbornly committed to the future of virtual reality as he is to his

06:17.700 --> 06:42.700
geeky ass haircut.

06:42.700 --> 06:47.580
Jaron's ambition for VR predicted much of what actually did come to pass.

06:47.580 --> 06:49.500
But they also went far beyond.

06:49.500 --> 06:54.340
As soon as VPL's computers were powerful enough, they created full-body tracking suits

06:54.340 --> 06:59.340
to show the movements of avatars and allowing VPL to live up to their acronym.

06:59.340 --> 07:04.940
Modern VR users are still shackled to these ankle-bracelet things to track full-body movement.

07:04.940 --> 07:08.780
Which is fitting because the only people who really use them are the inhabitants of VR

07:08.780 --> 07:12.660
chat, most of whom should probably be under house arrest.

07:12.660 --> 07:17.300
But naturally, virtual reality's most obvious application is as a tool to act out our most

07:17.300 --> 07:19.820
violent fantasies without consequence.

07:19.820 --> 07:27.700
I'm talking, of course, of video games.

07:27.700 --> 07:33.340
As the World Wide Web went worldwide in the 1990s, the idea of a totally computer-simulated

07:33.340 --> 07:38.020
world seemed a lot less far-fetched, even if some laughed off the internet itself as

07:38.020 --> 07:39.020
a gimmick.

07:39.020 --> 08:07.540
Consumers were finally vicarious.

08:07.540 --> 08:13.180
So companies quickly cobbled together some cheap plastic headsets to strap to their masses.

08:13.180 --> 08:18.420
Although not all of them made it to market, as was the case with Sega's VR glasses,

08:18.420 --> 08:28.660
which got aborted faster than a premature prom night accident.

08:28.660 --> 08:34.500
That same year, Dr. Jonathan Walden had slightly more success with his multiplayer arcade system,

08:34.500 --> 08:35.500
virtuality.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.780
A system where you could shoot each other on an arena of floating chessboards or beat

08:39.780 --> 08:42.340
each other off in a simulated boxing match.

08:42.340 --> 08:47.660
The company just about managed to stay in business throughout most of the 1990s, fuelled

08:47.660 --> 08:51.580
by novelty, hype and a still-priving arcade scene.

08:51.580 --> 08:55.300
But if you wanted to use a VR system that didn't need to be wiped down between each

08:55.300 --> 09:00.420
user, your only option was to get your hands on a Nintendo Virtual Boy.

09:00.420 --> 09:06.540
There was about five left in the country, I found one.

09:06.540 --> 09:11.300
I should probably start by saying that the Virtual Boy wasn't really virtual reality.

09:11.300 --> 09:17.100
It was a headset that was barely more sophisticated than Charlie Wheatstone's stereoscope.

09:17.100 --> 09:22.660
By blasting two separate, slightly different red and black images into your eyeholes, it

09:22.660 --> 09:27.660
created an illusion of depth and a sensation of having your retinas scrubbed with steel

09:27.660 --> 09:32.380
wool, which Nintendo seemed to understand when they advertised it as a creature from

09:32.380 --> 09:40.820
the furb dimension who wanted to give you an aggressive eye exam.

09:40.820 --> 09:44.940
Only 22 games were actually released for the console, and I hear about two of them are

09:44.940 --> 09:50.860
even remotely playable in the hunchback, airport, cavity check position that the console forces

09:50.860 --> 09:51.860
you to play in.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.100
But I'm going to let you in on a secret that you've probably already guessed at.

09:55.100 --> 10:01.420
I have always wanted one of these things, because I am a massive Tetris nerd, and it

10:01.420 --> 10:08.420
is the only console where you can play the worst version of Tetris ever made.

10:08.420 --> 10:13.980
Playing Virtual Boy 3D Tetris is what I imagine it must be like to die on the operating table

10:13.980 --> 10:16.300
while you're having a brain tumour removed.

10:16.300 --> 10:21.380
The overwhelming black space is the incoming darkness, while the incomprehensible mishmash

10:21.500 --> 10:27.340
of transparent red pieces represents the remnants of your threadbare and declining consciousness.

10:27.340 --> 10:32.420
All the while the ghoulish cartoon face of your next piece mocks your every attempt to

10:32.420 --> 10:34.500
escape the hell you're headed for.

10:34.500 --> 10:40.420
The unbearable and increasingly tense 8-bit soundtrack is pumped directly into your ears,

10:40.420 --> 10:45.180
making it feel like you're being forced to solve a Rubik's cube at gunpoint while simultaneously

10:45.180 --> 10:48.660
standing in a German techno club while colour blind.

10:48.660 --> 10:53.580
In summation, I fucking loved it.

10:53.580 --> 10:59.580
Meanwhile the reality dodging dweebs of the VR industry desperately saw novel ways to secure

10:59.580 --> 11:06.580
more funding for the future they were certain was just around a poorly rendered corner.

11:12.740 --> 11:17.140
One successful application was in training simulations to replace learning on the job

11:17.220 --> 11:22.540
where mistakes can be dangerous or prohibitively expensive, like in manufacturing or in surgery

11:22.540 --> 11:25.740
where you can remove someone's spine without consequence.

11:25.740 --> 11:31.420
Other uses though failed to take off, like VR immersion therapy, which was designed to

11:31.420 --> 11:34.540
help users get over their fear of flying.

11:34.540 --> 11:40.100
3D virtual modelling effectively replaced physical modelling in many design-led industries,

11:40.100 --> 11:44.820
though there were still relatively few occasions where viewing it through a headset was better

11:44.900 --> 11:48.300
than looking at it through a really big screen.

11:48.300 --> 11:52.580
But if you're a kid with a data glove then every problem looks like it can be solved

11:52.580 --> 11:54.500
with a bit of digital groping.

11:54.500 --> 11:59.460
The VR community genuinely believed that they could see into the future, and I think even

11:59.460 --> 12:03.460
their wildest, wrongest predictions are quite illuminating.

12:03.460 --> 12:09.380
That when we put this thing on we have bookshelves in various places and they are in the places

12:09.380 --> 12:13.540
where we put them last week or last month or two years ago and we go and get them in

12:13.540 --> 12:19.940
the same way and some of those are encyclopedias and some of those are dictionaries and some

12:19.940 --> 12:25.780
are stacks of transparencies that we put there two years ago, but we carry that with us and

12:25.780 --> 12:30.580
those are just data files that are inside the small thing that hangs on our belt.

12:30.580 --> 12:36.340
By putting on our own four-dimensional hindsight goggles we can see that this guy isn't predicting

12:36.340 --> 12:40.180
the future of VR, he's predicting smartphones.

12:40.180 --> 12:44.260
We do not talk enough, or we talk too much depending on your perspective, about how these

12:44.260 --> 12:50.180
things are already augmented reality devices that have written the logic of the digital

12:50.180 --> 12:52.300
world onto the physical one.

12:52.300 --> 12:57.980
What these guys had literally blinded themselves to was that total immersion only really appeals

12:57.980 --> 13:02.820
to a small cult of consumers who want to escape reality altogether.

13:02.820 --> 13:08.140
Keep that in mind as we enter the next century and the origins of the metaverse, but first

13:08.140 --> 13:10.380
a word from our sponsor.

13:10.380 --> 13:15.420
If you want to surf every corner of the metaverse, you're going to need the bodacious protection

13:15.420 --> 13:17.060
of Surfshark VPN.

13:17.060 --> 13:22.220
Surfshark automatically blocks over one million malicious websites, phishing methods and

13:22.220 --> 13:23.220
other threats.

13:23.220 --> 13:27.780
It also encrypts your data when you choose to unplug from the metaverse, so you can browse

13:27.780 --> 13:33.260
wiki feet on sketchy McDonald's Wi-Fi and no one will be the wiser.

13:33.260 --> 13:38.740
With their tubular noogs policy, Surfshark doesn't keep your data, and it protects

13:38.740 --> 13:41.540
you from the mega corporations who do.

13:41.540 --> 13:46.940
No part of the web is off limits, easily unblock streaming platforms across the world, so I

13:46.940 --> 13:49.820
can keep up with my Indonesian soap operas.

13:49.820 --> 13:50.820
Bagus!

13:50.820 --> 13:54.740
Surfshark is even useful during your shopping trip, keeping you from being the victim of

13:54.740 --> 13:57.260
location-based price discrimination.

13:57.260 --> 14:03.100
One subscription and you can run and install Surfshark on an unlimited number of devices.

14:03.940 --> 14:11.060
With 24-7 customer support and a 30-day money-back guarantee, don't surf without the shark.

14:11.060 --> 14:18.220
Get Surfshark VPN in the link below and use my code, OrdinaryThings, for 83% off and

14:18.220 --> 14:20.300
3 months extra free.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.300
Go on, do it.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.420
They're good, I'll use them.

14:23.420 --> 14:25.420
So what is the metaverse?

14:25.420 --> 14:30.140
Well it depends who you ask and how much money they expect to make from their definition

14:30.140 --> 14:31.740
of it taking off.

14:31.740 --> 14:36.780
The meta wants you to believe that it isn't quite here yet, that it's the next evolutionary

14:36.780 --> 14:41.620
step in the internet's life cycle, specifically the bit in the chart where we go from being

14:41.620 --> 14:46.820
hunched over our screens to launch over our coffee tables.

14:46.820 --> 14:52.020
Parasitic crypto types would have you believe that it's an investment opportunity.

14:52.020 --> 14:57.580
The next gold rush for digital goods, land and services that will all be accessible in

14:57.580 --> 14:59.620
the same cyber casino.

14:59.620 --> 15:04.420
Metaverses argue that the metaverse won't be a head-mounted escape hatch from reality

15:04.420 --> 15:05.420
at all.

15:05.420 --> 15:10.900
Rather, it will be a sort of digital scab that will crust over meat space with the logic

15:10.900 --> 15:11.900
of the internet.

15:11.900 --> 15:16.020
But I'd argue, in a way, the metaverse is already here.

15:16.020 --> 15:19.700
In fact, it's been here for nearly 20 years.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.700
Twist.

15:22.700 --> 15:27.540
The 2000s was a relatively quiet time when it came to VR tech.

15:27.540 --> 15:31.620
The real innovations were saved for those small screens that you can cram in your pocket

15:31.620 --> 15:33.740
and smear with sweet baby rays.

15:33.740 --> 15:39.340
VR headsets looked set to be buried in the 1990s layer of the landfill, right next to

15:39.340 --> 15:44.660
those floral sofas, furbies and copies of the OJ Simpson workout video.

15:44.660 --> 15:50.260
And as the 21st century finally stopped buffering, the first metaverses came online.

15:50.260 --> 15:55.660
Massively multiplayer online games like Second Life, which was called a metaverse during

15:55.660 --> 16:01.420
this Google tech talk, which took place months before Facebook had even launched globally.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.940
Like Hunter said, the basic idea with Second Life was, and it wasn't something that was

16:04.940 --> 16:09.220
possible until five or six years ago to even really start working on, it was this radical

16:09.220 --> 16:13.420
idea that, well, what if you could create a 3D immersive environment that looked as

16:13.420 --> 16:18.900
good as a video game that was tactile and visceral and exciting and sexy, fun to be

16:18.900 --> 16:24.260
in, but had the, of course, very web-like and very compelling property that everything

16:24.260 --> 16:25.780
in it was built by you.

16:25.780 --> 16:31.580
The game itself was released in 2003 to the rabid excitement of anyone who wanted to fuck

16:31.580 --> 16:32.580
the Sims.

16:32.580 --> 16:37.660
Over the course of ten years, its world grew to accommodate over a million active users,

16:37.660 --> 16:43.900
and its pre-Bitcoin digital currency fueled an economy based on in-game real estate, clothing

16:43.900 --> 16:46.020
and customisable genitals.

16:46.020 --> 16:50.380
Manpower's virtual world's liaison Dan Darrow and his team have interviewed hundreds

16:50.380 --> 16:55.100
of people from over 50 countries in Second Life, sometimes using instant translation

16:55.100 --> 16:57.580
devices to communicate.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.680
Part of the company's groundbreaking exploration of virtual work includes convening great thinkers

17:02.680 --> 17:04.180
in Second Life.

17:04.180 --> 17:08.700
Facebook's plan to launch its own cryptocurrency was killed by regulators before they'd even

17:08.700 --> 17:13.740
had a chance to fleece people, but all the way back in 2006, Lyndon Dollars had funded

17:13.740 --> 17:18.900
the fortune of the internet's first digital land baron, Anshay Chung.

17:18.900 --> 17:24.020
The avatar of Aileen Grafe earned millions entirely within Second Life's economy, and

17:24.020 --> 17:25.300
she wasn't alone.

17:25.300 --> 17:31.460
CNN interviewed these specimens in 2010, who were living off the spoils of their own Second

17:31.460 --> 17:32.980
Life real estate empire.

17:48.900 --> 18:01.620
It's clear to see that Second Lifeers were living the dream, both on and off screen.

18:01.620 --> 18:11.260
In a metaverse that pioneered the play to earn grift before it even had a name, VR didn't

18:11.260 --> 18:18.260
make its comeback until 2012, when a 19-year-old named Palmer Lucky posted his plans to escape

18:18.380 --> 18:24.620
from reality on Kickstarter.

18:24.620 --> 18:30.700
He received $2.5 million, and the attention of anyone who still dreamed of mediating all

18:30.700 --> 18:34.020
of their social interactions through a computer screen.

18:34.020 --> 19:02.420
It's her one such dreamer, Mark Zuckerberg.

19:02.420 --> 19:09.060
2012 was also when Facebook rolled out mobile targeted ads, a decision that would grow the

19:09.060 --> 19:12.980
company's profits exponentially for the next 10 years.

19:12.980 --> 19:18.500
It crammed ads into the parts of our lives that had hitherto been ad-free.

19:18.500 --> 19:23.700
Now companies could reach you at the dinner table, in the elevator, or on the toilet, and

19:23.700 --> 19:25.780
the world was better for it.

19:25.780 --> 19:30.860
Or at least Mark thought so, but he dreamed of a further invasion, total dominion over

19:30.860 --> 19:32.420
the world's eyeballs.

19:32.420 --> 19:39.020
Starting small, Mark acquired Instagram for a measly $1 billion, and then two years later

19:39.020 --> 19:44.380
spent over three times that amount to acquire Oculus, which tells you everything about what

19:44.380 --> 19:46.300
Mark thinks about VR.

19:46.300 --> 19:48.260
He is a true believer.

19:48.260 --> 19:53.220
Since then, he has been promoting VR as the next step in personal computing.

19:53.220 --> 20:04.340
And it's easy to see his lizard brain logic.

20:04.340 --> 20:09.060
Computers started off squirrel the way in their own little room, but with the advent of PCs

20:09.060 --> 20:13.960
and the smartphone, they've been slowly edging closer and closer to your face.

20:13.960 --> 20:18.700
It only makes sense to Mark that humans will eventually end our decade long flirtation

20:18.700 --> 20:26.540
with the screen and just bolt them directly to our skull.

20:26.540 --> 20:31.940
So his mission for the last decade has been to fast forward this future into the present.

20:31.940 --> 20:38.980
Presumably so, he'll never have to make eye contact with any of us again.

20:38.980 --> 20:46.540
Since 2016, over 35 VR headsets have been released to a mostly uninterested public, and to a

20:46.620 --> 20:51.260
rabid, red-faced cult of consumers who are keeping the industry alive.

20:51.260 --> 20:55.580
Personally, I'd say I'm a sort of fringe member of this cult.

20:55.580 --> 21:00.340
I'm enthusiastic, but would ultimately duck out the back exit if they started handing

21:00.340 --> 21:01.340
out Kool-Aid.

21:01.340 --> 21:06.100
For most of us, though, Virtual Reality's main appeal is a gaming experience that's

21:06.100 --> 21:10.020
so immersive that it's absolutely fucking nauseating.

21:10.020 --> 21:16.940
I'd say VR is the greatest way yet invented to purge that semi-dormant desire for violence

21:16.940 --> 21:19.660
that lives inside all of our primate brains.

21:19.660 --> 21:24.820
The only reason to play the buggy-as-fuck, unfinished, but incredibly popular blade and

21:24.820 --> 21:31.820
sorcery is just how effectively it allows you to satisfy your inner sadist.

21:40.300 --> 21:47.300
Best of all, because the screen is only visible to you, no one else can see the grisly game

21:48.660 --> 21:53.060
of whack-a-mole that you're playing with a knife and some dude's torso.

21:53.060 --> 21:57.700
If you do need to satisfy your bloodlust, though, it's still a lot cheaper to sprinkle

21:57.700 --> 22:02.340
broken glass on the beach or poison food at your local homelessness shelter.

22:02.340 --> 22:07.540
Most of the best VR games are only playable on an expensive headset that needs to be tethered

22:07.620 --> 22:10.100
to an even pricier gaming PC.

22:10.100 --> 22:16.060
The Valve Index and every HTC device require you to be tethered to your computer master

22:16.060 --> 22:21.020
like the techno-gimp that you are, said the man in the leather jacket, which has really

22:21.020 --> 22:24.900
limited their sales and prevented them from reaching widespread appeal.

22:24.900 --> 22:31.380
To satisfy consumer curiosity, Oculus funded the Samsung Gear, allowing people to test-drive

22:31.380 --> 22:36.460
the function of Virtual Reality by slotting their greasy smartphones into a piece of head-mounted

22:36.460 --> 22:37.460
plastic.

22:37.460 --> 22:43.140
The smartphone VR sold extremely well for about a year, at which point these devices

22:43.140 --> 22:48.380
started gathering dust in garages across the world when people realised they were shit.

22:48.380 --> 22:53.500
But their strong sales showed Mark and the wider VR community that this technology would

22:53.500 --> 22:59.380
never reach widespread adoption until it was cheap, untethered and not shit.

22:59.380 --> 23:03.740
The only headsets that have fulfilled these three criteria are the Oculus Quest and its

23:03.740 --> 23:10.060
successor, the Quest 2, which finally offer users the best of both worlds, as it is untethered

23:10.060 --> 23:15.820
but you can plug it into a PC if you want to experience good VR games.

23:15.820 --> 23:20.900
And its base model is pretty cheap, or at least it's cheaper than an iPhone, or this

23:20.900 --> 23:27.300
fucking mental Gucci visor I found, which presumably only appeals to the Goff Centurion

23:27.300 --> 23:29.860
who rides horses on weekends.

23:29.860 --> 23:34.420
Of course, you look nearly as socially defective wearing one of these in public, but it's

23:34.420 --> 23:39.860
obvious why it's dominating the market, it's an amazing piece of tech, totally intuitive

23:39.860 --> 23:47.300
and unlike anything on the market at a competing price.

23:47.300 --> 23:52.260
Meta don't release their sales figures, but the best independent estimates suggest they

23:52.260 --> 23:55.420
have sold over 10 million units this year.

23:55.420 --> 23:59.180
And that is largely because people can actually afford them.

23:59.180 --> 24:04.700
But Mark and his meta mates are probably losing billions in selling them.

24:04.700 --> 24:11.900
I say probably because again, Meta are very secretive about their sales figures and overheads.

24:11.900 --> 24:18.420
But their reality labs division that make the headsets have reported massive and metastasizing

24:18.420 --> 24:19.420
losses.

24:19.420 --> 24:26.420
Mark is doing this because he knows that widespread VR adoption needs to happen before big developers

24:26.420 --> 24:49.340
will sink money into software.

24:49.340 --> 24:55.660
It is hugely unlikely that Meta is making anything close to a profit with these headsets,

24:55.660 --> 24:59.100
and it is still light years from mainstream adoption.

24:59.100 --> 25:04.580
With Meta's other services showing signs of declining cultural relevance, the metaverse

25:04.580 --> 25:08.700
is an enormous gamble for Mark to hedge his entire company on.

25:08.700 --> 25:13.660
So Mark is bankrolling the entire consumer VR sector.

25:13.660 --> 25:18.780
Without his initial investment in Oculus, the funding of smartphone tech or the Kamikaze

25:19.220 --> 25:24.420
Oculus price tag, the whole industry would still just be a techy niche.

25:24.420 --> 25:29.260
He has spent the last five years trying to sell VR as something more than a head-mounted

25:29.260 --> 25:30.860
entertainment system.

25:30.860 --> 25:36.260
Like in this bizarre presentation, where he appeared as a Wii Sports avatar in a disaster

25:36.260 --> 25:41.780
zone to promote VR as some kind of empathy machine, while still lacking enough human

25:41.780 --> 25:54.100
connection to pull off a convincing high-five.

25:54.100 --> 25:59.180
More recently, Mark has tried to suck all the fun out of VR by promoting the Virtual

25:59.180 --> 26:00.740
Reality Office.

26:00.740 --> 26:06.100
To most people, having your workstation beamed into your eyes is a bit like having your brain

26:06.100 --> 26:07.540
taken hostage.

26:07.540 --> 26:12.220
Why anyone would suffer through the eye and neck strain of having a monitor attached to

26:12.220 --> 26:17.060
your face when a screen or two do just as well is beyond me.

26:17.060 --> 26:18.540
I don't think anyone's convinced.

26:18.540 --> 26:22.460
I've scoured the internet and I have not found one piece of footage where people are

26:22.460 --> 26:34.380
at Facebook HQ doing their work with a fucking Oculus strap to their head.

26:34.380 --> 26:40.300
Then there's the Virtual Collaborative Office, which I think has only found supporters thanks

26:40.300 --> 26:44.620
to pandemic-era brain rot disguised as innovation.

26:44.620 --> 26:50.540
In a few years, these scenes will look as batshit as those water gun baptisms do now.

26:50.540 --> 26:56.340
Meta's idea of a virtual workspace isn't completely off base, though.

26:56.340 --> 27:02.380
The VR industry's main source of revenue, other than entertainment, is in enterprise.

27:02.380 --> 27:05.340
Not much has changed since the 1990s.

27:05.340 --> 27:10.460
It's still mostly used for highly specific scenarios where employees are being trained

27:10.460 --> 27:13.060
to work in physical environments.

27:13.060 --> 27:18.020
There are also training simulators that teach you how to do the soft-handed tasks of white-collar

27:18.020 --> 27:24.740
workers too, like this one from Tailspin that teaches you how to fire an old man named Barry

27:24.740 --> 27:38.420
and emotionally cope as you watch the life drain from his eyes.

27:38.420 --> 27:44.100
Although it seems pretty limited, I fired Barry over and over and over again, and while

27:44.100 --> 27:49.300
it did finally satisfy my need for virtual sadism, it didn't teach me what to do if

27:49.300 --> 27:56.620
he showed up the next day with a bad attitude at an AR-15.

27:56.620 --> 28:01.780
While Mark has been busy trying to show the world that VR is more than a neat toy, other

28:01.780 --> 28:06.260
companies have been busy building their own mini metaverses.

28:06.260 --> 28:12.940
These are game worlds or virtual experiences where you can make friends, explore user-generated

28:12.940 --> 28:15.980
content and hopefully make some cash.

28:15.980 --> 28:20.740
So for the last few weeks, I've been travelling the metaverse, trying to discover the future

28:20.740 --> 28:22.740
and maybe myself.

28:22.740 --> 28:29.340
But as far as I can see, it is mostly occupied by free main groups, children, crypto bros

28:29.340 --> 28:31.340
and the sexually peculiar.

28:31.340 --> 28:35.300
No judgement, but that's maybe free groups that you don't want hanging out in the same

28:35.300 --> 28:36.300
space.

28:36.300 --> 28:42.780
The most cynical metaverse type thing going on right now is Decentraland, a play-to-earn

28:42.780 --> 28:45.540
metaverse built on the blockchain.

28:45.540 --> 28:50.060
Try saying that word-salad sentence to someone who isn't terminally online and they'll

28:50.060 --> 28:53.300
look at you like they just walk in on you, beating your sabre.

28:53.300 --> 28:59.140
Despite this 2017 advertisement, Decentraland is currently still desktop only.

28:59.140 --> 29:05.820
With shit-tier visuals, broken environments and nothing to do other than buy stuff, Decentraland's

29:05.820 --> 29:09.540
main appeal is that it's an investment opportunity.

29:09.540 --> 29:15.460
Plots of virtual real estate sell for thousands, sometimes millions, mostly to companies who

29:15.460 --> 29:19.060
can afford to take a gamble on something so speculative.

29:19.060 --> 29:24.860
J.P. Morgan has even opened its own branch in Decentraland, tucked away somewhere between

29:24.860 --> 29:29.380
the crypto casinos and NFT art galleries.

29:29.380 --> 29:34.820
During my travels in Decentraland, I saw just as many adverts trying to sell land as people

29:34.820 --> 29:36.580
actually building stuff on it.

29:36.580 --> 29:41.740
The fact that one of the only things to do in Decentraland is blow wads of crypto, a

29:41.740 --> 29:47.300
cyber casino under the judgemental eyes of Pepe LeFrog tells you everything you need

29:47.300 --> 29:51.100
to know about this metaverse and its inhabitants.

29:51.100 --> 29:57.740
To their credit, Decentraland did try to spice things up with a metaverse rave back in December,

29:57.740 --> 30:01.540
but it looked about as much fun as getting a root canal at the Holocaust Museum.

30:01.540 --> 30:08.460
A real metaverse needs meaningful interaction, immersion and a successful simulation of something

30:08.460 --> 30:13.580
that users can't get in the real world, which is why I can no longer avoid talking

30:13.580 --> 30:18.860
about VRChat.

30:18.860 --> 30:23.820
Depending on the stats you read, VRChat might be the most continuously popular community

30:23.820 --> 30:29.500
in virtual reality, even though most users don't actually access this world with a

30:29.500 --> 30:30.500
headset.

30:30.500 --> 30:34.780
It's a game that has no objective other than socialization.

30:34.780 --> 30:41.700
Users inhabit strange characters in user-generated worlds and simulate acts that are an abomination

30:41.700 --> 30:42.700
before God.

30:42.700 --> 30:47.580
And annoyingly, I must argue that this is genuinely groundbreaking.

30:47.580 --> 30:53.260
Fifteen years ago, Second Life pioneered cyber sex when it allowed its users to customize

30:53.260 --> 30:56.580
their balls and visit cyber brothels.

30:56.580 --> 31:01.700
Some even found love, but injured even after they discovered their partner wasn't actually

31:01.700 --> 31:04.260
a foreboobed succubus from Mars.

31:04.260 --> 31:09.900
But VRChat's passionate community is now using cutting-edge tech and their degenerate

31:09.900 --> 31:15.260
imaginations to take cyber sex to brave new heights.

31:15.260 --> 31:20.960
Erotic Roleplay, or ERC, is a large part of VRChat's culture.

31:20.960 --> 31:27.060
One thing I learnt during my travels in this metaverse is that you must stay away from

31:27.060 --> 31:34.020
fur hub or club meeker if you value your sanity and or virtual personal space.

31:34.020 --> 31:39.660
In this seventh circle of virtual hell, I found rooms that can be locked for privacy.

31:39.660 --> 31:45.900
Custom avatars that were extremely unsafe for work and people using body tracking tech

31:45.900 --> 31:50.460
to turn jerking off in front of their computer monitor into a performance art.

31:50.460 --> 31:56.980
The VRChat community's commitment to debasing themselves has meant that it is now unmistakably

31:56.980 --> 32:01.740
the most immersive social experience in all of virtual reality.

32:01.740 --> 32:06.020
Users are so attached to their avatars that it's just as common to see crowds of users

32:06.020 --> 32:10.820
standing in front of in-game mirrors as it is to see someone getting straddled by a wolf.

32:10.820 --> 32:15.900
There is also a small community who sleep with their headsets on, aiming to wake up

32:15.900 --> 32:17.940
immersed in the virtual world.

32:17.940 --> 32:22.420
Some have become so immersed in this world that they allege they can feel the touch of

32:22.420 --> 32:26.740
other users, a sensation they call phantom touch.

32:26.740 --> 32:31.540
But considering one of the other things that VRChat is famous for is kids screaming into

32:31.540 --> 32:35.740
the mic and running around these worlds, I'm a little worried about who's getting phantom

32:35.740 --> 32:37.620
touched if you get what I'm saying.

32:37.620 --> 32:42.340
While researching all this has made me want to cry in the shower, it shows you just how

32:42.340 --> 32:46.740
immersive virtual reality has become for its most devoted users.

32:46.740 --> 32:52.660
But its alienating weirdness also demonstrates how far it is from any kind of widespread

32:52.660 --> 32:58.220
adoption.

32:58.220 --> 33:03.780
Since Mark announced Facebook's desperate meta makeover in December, he has been pushing

33:03.780 --> 33:07.700
his own brand metaverse, Horizon Worlds.

33:07.700 --> 33:12.940
It's clear that it's been designed to appeal to a broader audience, and it's doing this

33:12.940 --> 33:20.020
partly by alienating the kind of users who already love VR and make its worlds come alive.

33:20.020 --> 33:24.060
First of all, there are no furries allowed in Mark's metaverse.

33:24.060 --> 33:28.820
No, only floating torsos that are supposed to look like you after you've stood on a

33:28.820 --> 33:30.220
landmine.

33:30.220 --> 33:35.540
Having legs is a frequent cause of complication in other social VR apps.

33:35.540 --> 33:41.660
This keeps Mark's world less janky, but it also conveniently keeps it free of genitals.

33:41.660 --> 33:46.820
Although this hasn't stopped early testers reporting sexual harassment in Mark's brave

33:46.820 --> 33:52.180
new world, forcing meta to hastily give people the power to set up their own little safe

33:52.180 --> 33:56.660
space so no one can fondle the empty space where their balls would be.

33:56.660 --> 34:03.140
In Horizon Worlds there are also no kids allowed, which, to be fair, is a really good idea.

34:03.140 --> 34:07.620
One of the main complaints that a lot of users have with other social VR apps is that they're

34:07.620 --> 34:12.820
filled with more screaming, unwanted children than an orphanage for arsonists.

34:12.820 --> 34:18.460
But despite meta's 18 plus policy, their world is no exception to this.

34:18.460 --> 34:32.060
With microphone-abusing infants somehow managing to bypass Mark's airtight security system.

34:32.060 --> 34:37.300
The creator tools in Horizon Worlds are supposed to be inclusive too, and they are.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.220
They're impressively easy to use.

34:39.580 --> 34:59.460
This will allow more people to get creative, but their limitations will result in flat,

34:59.460 --> 35:03.580
uninteresting lands with repetitive interactive features.

35:03.580 --> 35:08.580
This will kill the service in the long run, as talented world builders will be attracted

35:08.660 --> 35:13.740
to similar apps that are harder to use but are more rewarding.

35:13.740 --> 35:17.860
Sometimes it looks like Mark has shot himself in the foot with the starting pistol before

35:17.860 --> 35:19.420
the race had even begun.

35:19.420 --> 35:25.020
To achieve profitability, the metaverse and VR needs to reach widespread adoption.

35:25.020 --> 35:29.460
And honestly, I'm not sure I see that ever happening, but it certainly won't happen

35:29.460 --> 35:33.980
if meta continues to alienate the people who already love VR.

35:33.980 --> 35:38.580
Although if their latest Super Bowl ad is anything to go by, meta have realised the

35:38.580 --> 35:44.420
error of their ways, and will soon be letting the furries fly their freak flag any day now.

35:47.180 --> 35:52.900
I think that Mark Zuckerberg has fallen for the same fallacy that the VR creators of old

35:52.900 --> 35:53.980
did.

35:53.980 --> 35:59.380
They think that once the tech improves, once the screens get clearer and the headsets get

35:59.460 --> 36:02.420
lighter, then everyone will be into VR.

36:02.420 --> 36:09.340
Whether it's virtual reality, crypto or AI, smug, nerdy early adopters love to pat themselves

36:09.340 --> 36:11.900
on the back about seeing what's coming next.

36:11.900 --> 36:16.620
But in the case of VR, I think it will remain relatively niche.

36:16.620 --> 36:22.460
Normal people are already scared of how much power their screens have over their daily lives.

36:22.460 --> 36:26.860
If you're going to get them to enter a metaverse of some kind or another, you're going to

36:26.860 --> 36:28.340
have to trick them.

36:28.340 --> 36:34.940
That's why the metaverse I choose to smugly predict is on its way, is one based on augmented

36:34.940 --> 36:36.420
reality.

36:36.420 --> 36:41.940
The metaverse won't be a digital world that you can escape into, it'll be a digital

36:41.940 --> 36:45.020
layer that none of us can escape from.

36:45.020 --> 36:51.100
As QR codes plaster the planet and our social lives are mediated by technology, the groundwork

36:51.100 --> 36:52.460
is already being laid.

36:52.460 --> 36:57.500
Pokemon Go already proved that augmented reality could turn the normies into an army

36:57.500 --> 37:04.060
of stampeding zombies competing for the ownership of a digital asset in the form of a Zubat.

37:04.060 --> 37:09.060
Apple and Google are already hard at work on their own AR goggles.

37:09.060 --> 37:14.980
Some might even be released this year, and meta are mapping the world with live maps.

37:14.980 --> 37:20.220
Whether we view it through our phones or a pair of newfangled goggles or a non-invasive

37:20.220 --> 37:26.900
brain chip, one day I think the internet will sort of infect the physical world.

37:26.900 --> 37:30.540
And they'll sell it to us as an escape from the screen.

37:30.540 --> 37:35.460
View a new world with new eyes, new eyes that will sell to you.

37:35.460 --> 37:39.420
That's the future I reckon might be round the corner.

37:39.420 --> 37:43.100
So if you don't mind, I'm going to forget about all that and go play some Tetris.

37:43.100 --> 37:47.820
Oh, and if you could like, share and comment, subscribe, all that kind of stuff, that'd

37:47.820 --> 37:48.820
be swell.

37:48.820 --> 37:50.100
I can go this way.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.300
Tetris.
