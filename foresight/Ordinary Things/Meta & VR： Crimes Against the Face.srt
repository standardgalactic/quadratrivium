1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,420
Imagine, if you will, a whole new dimension, a brief new world that you can only access

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,740
through the medium of a $300 electric blindfold, escape a material world that teeters on ecological

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,140
collapse and into a make-believe one where Half-Life 3 came out two years ago.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,780
This virtual world is so immersive that you might not notice when your girlfriend moves

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,300
out and takes half the furniture with her.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,380
But don't worry, because the only guys in the metaverse who don't have anime cat

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,340
girlfriends are the ones pretending to be them.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,980
But all is not well in this digital paradise, it's being conquered by an artificial intelligence

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,820
known as the Zuckerborg.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,180
The Zuckerborg might have convinced you that he birthed the metaverse from his own mind

11
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,900
folds, but its first bricks were laid decades ago.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,140
And if we're going to understand what the metaverse, actually, is, then we're going

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:04,820
to have to understand the dreams and ideals of its reality and deodorant dodging pioneers.

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,180
The earliest development in virtual reality actually takes us all the way back to London

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,940
in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,860
In 1838, if you wanted to escape the reality in front of your face, you could either visit

17
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,180
an opium den or try out one of Charles Wheatstone's stereoscopes.

18
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Charlie figured out that showing each eye two separate images taken from slightly different

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,900
angles gave the illusion of depth, and Victorians first harnessed this eye-tricking tech to

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,940
take little head holidays to famous landmarks.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,220
And like nearly all modern VR users, the next thing they wanted to see was some 3D double

22
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,100
Ds.

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,940
Stereoscopic pornography was extremely popular, and this would start a trend that we'll see

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,420
with pretty much every subsequent virtual reality.

25
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,500
Once someone figured out how to stitch still images together and trick people into thinking

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,900
they were going to get hit by a train, the stereoscope was out and cinema was in.

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:04,780
For the next 60 years, a flat screen in a dark room was immersive enough for these 20th century

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,780
simpletons.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,220
So there was no need to strap anything to your head.

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,980
That was until 1962, when one man was brave enough to ask the question, what if you could

31
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,420
smell movies too?

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:24,100
Morton Highlig was the inventor of the Sensorama machine.

33
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,100
And while its patent diagram might make you think it was designed to cook your head like

34
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,860
a succulent, microwavable meal, it was actually an immersive cinema experience.

35
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,380
In the Sensorama, your head could see, feel and smell five whole films, all farted straight

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,380
from Morton's own mind box.

37
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:55,220
And here, Morton is still leagues ahead of modern VR, where the only thing I can smell

38
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,260
is my own sweaty pits after a vigorous beat saver session.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,060
These though were just the first evolutionary steps in VR.

40
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,460
The hunched over head mounted monkeys who had to walk before we could run straight into

41
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
our living room wall.

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,140
But in the same year that man walked on the moon, a computer scientist was taking the

43
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,980
first giant leap into virtual reality.

44
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,820
Ivan created a headset attached to a ceiling mounted system called the Sword of Damocles,

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,980
which allowed the user to see a virtual environment from different angles without snapping their

46
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,140
neck in half.

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,740
While Ivan could be considered the daddy of VR as we know it, his metaverse was nothing

48
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,260
more than a single wire-framed room, which he modestly showed off in this lecture from

49
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,260
1996.

50
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,780
As virtual reality became a reality, its pioneers had to cook up real-world reasons for the

51
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,780
government to spend millions on their made-up fantasy worlds.

52
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:12,060
By 1985, NASA had given up on sending people to the moon, but they still had enough cash

53
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,860
to spaff on VR motorcycle helmets.

54
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,660
NASA believed these headsets would be used to control robotic vehicles and that VR itself

55
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,140
would be a sort of virtual workstation and three-dimensional data space.

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,820
While NASA was limited by the technology of its era, virtual reality was being fully explored

57
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
in 1980s fiction.

58
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,900
In 1984, William Gibson published Neuromancer, the first of three novels set in the sprawl,

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,140
a science fiction world where drug-addled, sex-mad console cowboys entered a cyberspace

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,500
matrix to take on different physical forms.

61
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,740
An anime from 1985 called Megazone 23 also beat the Matrix to the punch with its whole

62
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,580
— actually, you're living in a computer simulation twist — complete with black-suited

63
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,060
agents, computer-simulated women, and some familiar dialogue.

64
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,580
Back in the real world, though, a video game developer and white dude with dreads named

65
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,900
Jaron Lanier was about to push us hard into the Matrix.

66
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,140
After making a ton of cash from developing games like Moondust for the Commodore 64,

67
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:35,020
Jaron started VPL, Virtual Programming Languages, a company that jump-started the first age

68
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,580
of consumer-focused virtual reality, with products like the Data Glove and the iPhone.

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,580
That's eye-like-eye.

70
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,580
That wasn't clear.

71
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Finally, allowing users to finger the blocky inhabitants of the same virtual dimension

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,580
where those 90s bowling alley animations must have come from.

73
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,020
If you wanted to slip on a Data Glove, though, it would have cost you about eight grand.

74
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,780
And that doesn't include the $200,000 computer you'd have needed to run a simulation on

75
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
an iPhone.

76
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:13,340
Jaron was, and remains, a dreamer who had deep insights about where the future was going.

77
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,620
And he was as stubbornly committed to the future of virtual reality as he is to his

78
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:42,700
geeky ass haircut.

79
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,580
Jaron's ambition for VR predicted much of what actually did come to pass.

80
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,500
But they also went far beyond.

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,340
As soon as VPL's computers were powerful enough, they created full-body tracking suits

82
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,340
to show the movements of avatars and allowing VPL to live up to their acronym.

83
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,940
Modern VR users are still shackled to these ankle-bracelet things to track full-body movement.

84
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,780
Which is fitting because the only people who really use them are the inhabitants of VR

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,660
chat, most of whom should probably be under house arrest.

86
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,300
But naturally, virtual reality's most obvious application is as a tool to act out our most

87
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,820
violent fantasies without consequence.

88
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm talking, of course, of video games.

89
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,340
As the World Wide Web went worldwide in the 1990s, the idea of a totally computer-simulated

90
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,020
world seemed a lot less far-fetched, even if some laughed off the internet itself as

91
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
a gimmick.

92
00:07:39,020 --> 00:08:07,540
Consumers were finally vicarious.

93
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,180
So companies quickly cobbled together some cheap plastic headsets to strap to their masses.

94
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,420
Although not all of them made it to market, as was the case with Sega's VR glasses,

95
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:28,660
which got aborted faster than a premature prom night accident.

96
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,500
That same year, Dr. Jonathan Walden had slightly more success with his multiplayer arcade system,

97
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
virtuality.

98
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,780
A system where you could shoot each other on an arena of floating chessboards or beat

99
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,340
each other off in a simulated boxing match.

100
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,660
The company just about managed to stay in business throughout most of the 1990s, fuelled

101
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,580
by novelty, hype and a still-priving arcade scene.

102
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,300
But if you wanted to use a VR system that didn't need to be wiped down between each

103
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,420
user, your only option was to get your hands on a Nintendo Virtual Boy.

104
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,540
There was about five left in the country, I found one.

105
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,300
I should probably start by saying that the Virtual Boy wasn't really virtual reality.

106
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,100
It was a headset that was barely more sophisticated than Charlie Wheatstone's stereoscope.

107
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,660
By blasting two separate, slightly different red and black images into your eyeholes, it

108
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,660
created an illusion of depth and a sensation of having your retinas scrubbed with steel

109
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,380
wool, which Nintendo seemed to understand when they advertised it as a creature from

110
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:40,820
the furb dimension who wanted to give you an aggressive eye exam.

111
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,940
Only 22 games were actually released for the console, and I hear about two of them are

112
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,860
even remotely playable in the hunchback, airport, cavity check position that the console forces

113
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,860
you to play in.

114
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,100
But I'm going to let you in on a secret that you've probably already guessed at.

115
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,420
I have always wanted one of these things, because I am a massive Tetris nerd, and it

116
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:08,420
is the only console where you can play the worst version of Tetris ever made.

117
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,980
Playing Virtual Boy 3D Tetris is what I imagine it must be like to die on the operating table

118
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,300
while you're having a brain tumour removed.

119
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,380
The overwhelming black space is the incoming darkness, while the incomprehensible mishmash

120
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,340
of transparent red pieces represents the remnants of your threadbare and declining consciousness.

121
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:32,420
All the while the ghoulish cartoon face of your next piece mocks your every attempt to

122
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,500
escape the hell you're headed for.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,420
The unbearable and increasingly tense 8-bit soundtrack is pumped directly into your ears,

124
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,180
making it feel like you're being forced to solve a Rubik's cube at gunpoint while simultaneously

125
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,660
standing in a German techno club while colour blind.

126
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,580
In summation, I fucking loved it.

127
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Meanwhile the reality dodging dweebs of the VR industry desperately saw novel ways to secure

128
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,580
more funding for the future they were certain was just around a poorly rendered corner.

129
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,140
One successful application was in training simulations to replace learning on the job

130
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,540
where mistakes can be dangerous or prohibitively expensive, like in manufacturing or in surgery

131
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,740
where you can remove someone's spine without consequence.

132
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,420
Other uses though failed to take off, like VR immersion therapy, which was designed to

133
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,540
help users get over their fear of flying.

134
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,100
3D virtual modelling effectively replaced physical modelling in many design-led industries,

135
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,820
though there were still relatively few occasions where viewing it through a headset was better

136
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,300
than looking at it through a really big screen.

137
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,580
But if you're a kid with a data glove then every problem looks like it can be solved

138
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,500
with a bit of digital groping.

139
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,460
The VR community genuinely believed that they could see into the future, and I think even

140
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,460
their wildest, wrongest predictions are quite illuminating.

141
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:09,380
That when we put this thing on we have bookshelves in various places and they are in the places

142
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,540
where we put them last week or last month or two years ago and we go and get them in

143
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,940
the same way and some of those are encyclopedias and some of those are dictionaries and some

144
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,780
are stacks of transparencies that we put there two years ago, but we carry that with us and

145
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,580
those are just data files that are inside the small thing that hangs on our belt.

146
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:36,340
By putting on our own four-dimensional hindsight goggles we can see that this guy isn't predicting

147
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,180
the future of VR, he's predicting smartphones.

148
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,260
We do not talk enough, or we talk too much depending on your perspective, about how these

149
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:50,180
things are already augmented reality devices that have written the logic of the digital

150
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,300
world onto the physical one.

151
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,980
What these guys had literally blinded themselves to was that total immersion only really appeals

152
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,820
to a small cult of consumers who want to escape reality altogether.

153
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,140
Keep that in mind as we enter the next century and the origins of the metaverse, but first

154
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,380
a word from our sponsor.

155
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,420
If you want to surf every corner of the metaverse, you're going to need the bodacious protection

156
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,060
of Surfshark VPN.

157
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,220
Surfshark automatically blocks over one million malicious websites, phishing methods and

158
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
other threats.

159
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,780
It also encrypts your data when you choose to unplug from the metaverse, so you can browse

160
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:33,260
wiki feet on sketchy McDonald's Wi-Fi and no one will be the wiser.

161
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,740
With their tubular noogs policy, Surfshark doesn't keep your data, and it protects

162
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,540
you from the mega corporations who do.

163
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,940
No part of the web is off limits, easily unblock streaming platforms across the world, so I

164
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,820
can keep up with my Indonesian soap operas.

165
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Bagus!

166
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,740
Surfshark is even useful during your shopping trip, keeping you from being the victim of

167
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,260
location-based price discrimination.

168
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,100
One subscription and you can run and install Surfshark on an unlimited number of devices.

169
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:11,060
With 24-7 customer support and a 30-day money-back guarantee, don't surf without the shark.

170
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:18,220
Get Surfshark VPN in the link below and use my code, OrdinaryThings, for 83% off and

171
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,300
3 months extra free.

172
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Go on, do it.

173
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,420
They're good, I'll use them.

174
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
So what is the metaverse?

175
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,140
Well it depends who you ask and how much money they expect to make from their definition

176
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,740
of it taking off.

177
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,780
The meta wants you to believe that it isn't quite here yet, that it's the next evolutionary

178
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,620
step in the internet's life cycle, specifically the bit in the chart where we go from being

179
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,820
hunched over our screens to launch over our coffee tables.

180
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,020
Parasitic crypto types would have you believe that it's an investment opportunity.

181
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,580
The next gold rush for digital goods, land and services that will all be accessible in

182
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,620
the same cyber casino.

183
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,420
Metaverses argue that the metaverse won't be a head-mounted escape hatch from reality

184
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
at all.

185
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,900
Rather, it will be a sort of digital scab that will crust over meat space with the logic

186
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
of the internet.

187
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,020
But I'd argue, in a way, the metaverse is already here.

188
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,700
In fact, it's been here for nearly 20 years.

189
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Twist.

190
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,540
The 2000s was a relatively quiet time when it came to VR tech.

191
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,620
The real innovations were saved for those small screens that you can cram in your pocket

192
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,740
and smear with sweet baby rays.

193
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,340
VR headsets looked set to be buried in the 1990s layer of the landfill, right next to

194
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:44,660
those floral sofas, furbies and copies of the OJ Simpson workout video.

195
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,260
And as the 21st century finally stopped buffering, the first metaverses came online.

196
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,660
Massively multiplayer online games like Second Life, which was called a metaverse during

197
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:01,420
this Google tech talk, which took place months before Facebook had even launched globally.

198
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,940
Like Hunter said, the basic idea with Second Life was, and it wasn't something that was

199
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,220
possible until five or six years ago to even really start working on, it was this radical

200
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,420
idea that, well, what if you could create a 3D immersive environment that looked as

201
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,900
good as a video game that was tactile and visceral and exciting and sexy, fun to be

202
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,260
in, but had the, of course, very web-like and very compelling property that everything

203
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,780
in it was built by you.

204
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,580
The game itself was released in 2003 to the rabid excitement of anyone who wanted to fuck

205
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
the Sims.

206
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,660
Over the course of ten years, its world grew to accommodate over a million active users,

207
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,900
and its pre-Bitcoin digital currency fueled an economy based on in-game real estate, clothing

208
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,020
and customisable genitals.

209
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,380
Manpower's virtual world's liaison Dan Darrow and his team have interviewed hundreds

210
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,100
of people from over 50 countries in Second Life, sometimes using instant translation

211
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,580
devices to communicate.

212
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,680
Part of the company's groundbreaking exploration of virtual work includes convening great thinkers

213
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,180
in Second Life.

214
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,700
Facebook's plan to launch its own cryptocurrency was killed by regulators before they'd even

215
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:13,740
had a chance to fleece people, but all the way back in 2006, Lyndon Dollars had funded

216
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,900
the fortune of the internet's first digital land baron, Anshay Chung.

217
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,020
The avatar of Aileen Grafe earned millions entirely within Second Life's economy, and

218
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,300
she wasn't alone.

219
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,460
CNN interviewed these specimens in 2010, who were living off the spoils of their own Second

220
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,980
Life real estate empire.

221
00:17:48,900 --> 00:18:01,620
It's clear to see that Second Lifeers were living the dream, both on and off screen.

222
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:11,260
In a metaverse that pioneered the play to earn grift before it even had a name, VR didn't

223
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:18,260
make its comeback until 2012, when a 19-year-old named Palmer Lucky posted his plans to escape

224
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,620
from reality on Kickstarter.

225
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,700
He received $2.5 million, and the attention of anyone who still dreamed of mediating all

226
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,020
of their social interactions through a computer screen.

227
00:18:34,020 --> 00:19:02,420
It's her one such dreamer, Mark Zuckerberg.

228
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:09,060
2012 was also when Facebook rolled out mobile targeted ads, a decision that would grow the

229
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,980
company's profits exponentially for the next 10 years.

230
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,500
It crammed ads into the parts of our lives that had hitherto been ad-free.

231
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,700
Now companies could reach you at the dinner table, in the elevator, or on the toilet, and

232
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,780
the world was better for it.

233
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,860
Or at least Mark thought so, but he dreamed of a further invasion, total dominion over

234
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,420
the world's eyeballs.

235
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,020
Starting small, Mark acquired Instagram for a measly $1 billion, and then two years later

236
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,380
spent over three times that amount to acquire Oculus, which tells you everything about what

237
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,300
Mark thinks about VR.

238
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,260
He is a true believer.

239
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,220
Since then, he has been promoting VR as the next step in personal computing.

240
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:04,340
And it's easy to see his lizard brain logic.

241
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,060
Computers started off squirrel the way in their own little room, but with the advent of PCs

242
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,960
and the smartphone, they've been slowly edging closer and closer to your face.

243
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,700
It only makes sense to Mark that humans will eventually end our decade long flirtation

244
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:26,540
with the screen and just bolt them directly to our skull.

245
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,940
So his mission for the last decade has been to fast forward this future into the present.

246
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:38,980
Presumably so, he'll never have to make eye contact with any of us again.

247
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:46,540
Since 2016, over 35 VR headsets have been released to a mostly uninterested public, and to a

248
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,260
rabid, red-faced cult of consumers who are keeping the industry alive.

249
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,580
Personally, I'd say I'm a sort of fringe member of this cult.

250
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm enthusiastic, but would ultimately duck out the back exit if they started handing

251
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,340
out Kool-Aid.

252
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,100
For most of us, though, Virtual Reality's main appeal is a gaming experience that's

253
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,020
so immersive that it's absolutely fucking nauseating.

254
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,940
I'd say VR is the greatest way yet invented to purge that semi-dormant desire for violence

255
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,660
that lives inside all of our primate brains.

256
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,820
The only reason to play the buggy-as-fuck, unfinished, but incredibly popular blade and

257
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:31,820
sorcery is just how effectively it allows you to satisfy your inner sadist.

258
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:47,300
Best of all, because the screen is only visible to you, no one else can see the grisly game

259
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,060
of whack-a-mole that you're playing with a knife and some dude's torso.

260
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,700
If you do need to satisfy your bloodlust, though, it's still a lot cheaper to sprinkle

261
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,340
broken glass on the beach or poison food at your local homelessness shelter.

262
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,540
Most of the best VR games are only playable on an expensive headset that needs to be tethered

263
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,100
to an even pricier gaming PC.

264
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:16,060
The Valve Index and every HTC device require you to be tethered to your computer master

265
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:21,020
like the techno-gimp that you are, said the man in the leather jacket, which has really

266
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,900
limited their sales and prevented them from reaching widespread appeal.

267
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,380
To satisfy consumer curiosity, Oculus funded the Samsung Gear, allowing people to test-drive

268
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,460
the function of Virtual Reality by slotting their greasy smartphones into a piece of head-mounted

269
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
plastic.

270
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,140
The smartphone VR sold extremely well for about a year, at which point these devices

271
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,380
started gathering dust in garages across the world when people realised they were shit.

272
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,500
But their strong sales showed Mark and the wider VR community that this technology would

273
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,380
never reach widespread adoption until it was cheap, untethered and not shit.

274
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,740
The only headsets that have fulfilled these three criteria are the Oculus Quest and its

275
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:10,060
successor, the Quest 2, which finally offer users the best of both worlds, as it is untethered

276
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,820
but you can plug it into a PC if you want to experience good VR games.

277
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,900
And its base model is pretty cheap, or at least it's cheaper than an iPhone, or this

278
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,300
fucking mental Gucci visor I found, which presumably only appeals to the Goff Centurion

279
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,860
who rides horses on weekends.

280
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,420
Of course, you look nearly as socially defective wearing one of these in public, but it's

281
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,860
obvious why it's dominating the market, it's an amazing piece of tech, totally intuitive

282
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,300
and unlike anything on the market at a competing price.

283
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,260
Meta don't release their sales figures, but the best independent estimates suggest they

284
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,420
have sold over 10 million units this year.

285
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,180
And that is largely because people can actually afford them.

286
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,700
But Mark and his meta mates are probably losing billions in selling them.

287
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,900
I say probably because again, Meta are very secretive about their sales figures and overheads.

288
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,420
But their reality labs division that make the headsets have reported massive and metastasizing

289
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
losses.

290
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Mark is doing this because he knows that widespread VR adoption needs to happen before big developers

291
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:49,340
will sink money into software.

292
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,660
It is hugely unlikely that Meta is making anything close to a profit with these headsets,

293
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,100
and it is still light years from mainstream adoption.

294
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,580
With Meta's other services showing signs of declining cultural relevance, the metaverse

295
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,700
is an enormous gamble for Mark to hedge his entire company on.

296
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,660
So Mark is bankrolling the entire consumer VR sector.

297
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,780
Without his initial investment in Oculus, the funding of smartphone tech or the Kamikaze

298
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,420
Oculus price tag, the whole industry would still just be a techy niche.

299
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,260
He has spent the last five years trying to sell VR as something more than a head-mounted

300
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,860
entertainment system.

301
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,260
Like in this bizarre presentation, where he appeared as a Wii Sports avatar in a disaster

302
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,780
zone to promote VR as some kind of empathy machine, while still lacking enough human

303
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:54,100
connection to pull off a convincing high-five.

304
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,180
More recently, Mark has tried to suck all the fun out of VR by promoting the Virtual

305
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,740
Reality Office.

306
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,100
To most people, having your workstation beamed into your eyes is a bit like having your brain

307
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,540
taken hostage.

308
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,220
Why anyone would suffer through the eye and neck strain of having a monitor attached to

309
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,060
your face when a screen or two do just as well is beyond me.

310
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,540
I don't think anyone's convinced.

311
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,460
I've scoured the internet and I have not found one piece of footage where people are

312
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:34,380
at Facebook HQ doing their work with a fucking Oculus strap to their head.

313
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,300
Then there's the Virtual Collaborative Office, which I think has only found supporters thanks

314
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,620
to pandemic-era brain rot disguised as innovation.

315
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,540
In a few years, these scenes will look as batshit as those water gun baptisms do now.

316
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,340
Meta's idea of a virtual workspace isn't completely off base, though.

317
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,380
The VR industry's main source of revenue, other than entertainment, is in enterprise.

318
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,340
Not much has changed since the 1990s.

319
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,460
It's still mostly used for highly specific scenarios where employees are being trained

320
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,060
to work in physical environments.

321
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,020
There are also training simulators that teach you how to do the soft-handed tasks of white-collar

322
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:24,740
workers too, like this one from Tailspin that teaches you how to fire an old man named Barry

323
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:38,420
and emotionally cope as you watch the life drain from his eyes.

324
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,100
Although it seems pretty limited, I fired Barry over and over and over again, and while

325
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,300
it did finally satisfy my need for virtual sadism, it didn't teach me what to do if

326
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:56,620
he showed up the next day with a bad attitude at an AR-15.

327
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:01,780
While Mark has been busy trying to show the world that VR is more than a neat toy, other

328
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,260
companies have been busy building their own mini metaverses.

329
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,940
These are game worlds or virtual experiences where you can make friends, explore user-generated

330
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,980
content and hopefully make some cash.

331
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,740
So for the last few weeks, I've been travelling the metaverse, trying to discover the future

332
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,740
and maybe myself.

333
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,340
But as far as I can see, it is mostly occupied by free main groups, children, crypto bros

334
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
and the sexually peculiar.

335
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,300
No judgement, but that's maybe free groups that you don't want hanging out in the same

336
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
space.

337
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,780
The most cynical metaverse type thing going on right now is Decentraland, a play-to-earn

338
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,540
metaverse built on the blockchain.

339
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,060
Try saying that word-salad sentence to someone who isn't terminally online and they'll

340
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,300
look at you like they just walk in on you, beating your sabre.

341
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,140
Despite this 2017 advertisement, Decentraland is currently still desktop only.

342
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:05,820
With shit-tier visuals, broken environments and nothing to do other than buy stuff, Decentraland's

343
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,540
main appeal is that it's an investment opportunity.

344
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:15,460
Plots of virtual real estate sell for thousands, sometimes millions, mostly to companies who

345
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,060
can afford to take a gamble on something so speculative.

346
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:24,860
J.P. Morgan has even opened its own branch in Decentraland, tucked away somewhere between

347
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,380
the crypto casinos and NFT art galleries.

348
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,820
During my travels in Decentraland, I saw just as many adverts trying to sell land as people

349
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,580
actually building stuff on it.

350
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,740
The fact that one of the only things to do in Decentraland is blow wads of crypto, a

351
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,300
cyber casino under the judgemental eyes of Pepe LeFrog tells you everything you need

352
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,100
to know about this metaverse and its inhabitants.

353
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,740
To their credit, Decentraland did try to spice things up with a metaverse rave back in December,

354
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,540
but it looked about as much fun as getting a root canal at the Holocaust Museum.

355
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:08,460
A real metaverse needs meaningful interaction, immersion and a successful simulation of something

356
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,580
that users can't get in the real world, which is why I can no longer avoid talking

357
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,860
about VRChat.

358
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,820
Depending on the stats you read, VRChat might be the most continuously popular community

359
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,500
in virtual reality, even though most users don't actually access this world with a

360
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
headset.

361
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,780
It's a game that has no objective other than socialization.

362
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,700
Users inhabit strange characters in user-generated worlds and simulate acts that are an abomination

363
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,700
before God.

364
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,580
And annoyingly, I must argue that this is genuinely groundbreaking.

365
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:53,260
Fifteen years ago, Second Life pioneered cyber sex when it allowed its users to customize

366
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,580
their balls and visit cyber brothels.

367
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,700
Some even found love, but injured even after they discovered their partner wasn't actually

368
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,260
a foreboobed succubus from Mars.

369
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,900
But VRChat's passionate community is now using cutting-edge tech and their degenerate

370
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,260
imaginations to take cyber sex to brave new heights.

371
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,960
Erotic Roleplay, or ERC, is a large part of VRChat's culture.

372
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,060
One thing I learnt during my travels in this metaverse is that you must stay away from

373
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:34,020
fur hub or club meeker if you value your sanity and or virtual personal space.

374
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,660
In this seventh circle of virtual hell, I found rooms that can be locked for privacy.

375
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,900
Custom avatars that were extremely unsafe for work and people using body tracking tech

376
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,460
to turn jerking off in front of their computer monitor into a performance art.

377
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,980
The VRChat community's commitment to debasing themselves has meant that it is now unmistakably

378
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,740
the most immersive social experience in all of virtual reality.

379
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,020
Users are so attached to their avatars that it's just as common to see crowds of users

380
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,820
standing in front of in-game mirrors as it is to see someone getting straddled by a wolf.

381
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,900
There is also a small community who sleep with their headsets on, aiming to wake up

382
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,940
immersed in the virtual world.

383
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,420
Some have become so immersed in this world that they allege they can feel the touch of

384
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,740
other users, a sensation they call phantom touch.

385
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,540
But considering one of the other things that VRChat is famous for is kids screaming into

386
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,740
the mic and running around these worlds, I'm a little worried about who's getting phantom

387
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,620
touched if you get what I'm saying.

388
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:42,340
While researching all this has made me want to cry in the shower, it shows you just how

389
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,740
immersive virtual reality has become for its most devoted users.

390
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,660
But its alienating weirdness also demonstrates how far it is from any kind of widespread

391
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:58,220
adoption.

392
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:03,780
Since Mark announced Facebook's desperate meta makeover in December, he has been pushing

393
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,700
his own brand metaverse, Horizon Worlds.

394
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,940
It's clear that it's been designed to appeal to a broader audience, and it's doing this

395
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:20,020
partly by alienating the kind of users who already love VR and make its worlds come alive.

396
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,060
First of all, there are no furries allowed in Mark's metaverse.

397
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,820
No, only floating torsos that are supposed to look like you after you've stood on a

398
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,220
landmine.

399
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,540
Having legs is a frequent cause of complication in other social VR apps.

400
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:41,660
This keeps Mark's world less janky, but it also conveniently keeps it free of genitals.

401
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,820
Although this hasn't stopped early testers reporting sexual harassment in Mark's brave

402
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,180
new world, forcing meta to hastily give people the power to set up their own little safe

403
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,660
space so no one can fondle the empty space where their balls would be.

404
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:03,140
In Horizon Worlds there are also no kids allowed, which, to be fair, is a really good idea.

405
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,620
One of the main complaints that a lot of users have with other social VR apps is that they're

406
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,820
filled with more screaming, unwanted children than an orphanage for arsonists.

407
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,460
But despite meta's 18 plus policy, their world is no exception to this.

408
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:32,060
With microphone-abusing infants somehow managing to bypass Mark's airtight security system.

409
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,300
The creator tools in Horizon Worlds are supposed to be inclusive too, and they are.

410
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,220
They're impressively easy to use.

411
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:59,460
This will allow more people to get creative, but their limitations will result in flat,

412
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,580
uninteresting lands with repetitive interactive features.

413
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:08,580
This will kill the service in the long run, as talented world builders will be attracted

414
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,740
to similar apps that are harder to use but are more rewarding.

415
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,860
Sometimes it looks like Mark has shot himself in the foot with the starting pistol before

416
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,420
the race had even begun.

417
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:25,020
To achieve profitability, the metaverse and VR needs to reach widespread adoption.

418
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,460
And honestly, I'm not sure I see that ever happening, but it certainly won't happen

419
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,980
if meta continues to alienate the people who already love VR.

420
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,580
Although if their latest Super Bowl ad is anything to go by, meta have realised the

421
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,420
error of their ways, and will soon be letting the furries fly their freak flag any day now.

422
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,900
I think that Mark Zuckerberg has fallen for the same fallacy that the VR creators of old

423
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,980
did.

424
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,380
They think that once the tech improves, once the screens get clearer and the headsets get

425
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,420
lighter, then everyone will be into VR.

426
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:09,340
Whether it's virtual reality, crypto or AI, smug, nerdy early adopters love to pat themselves

427
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,900
on the back about seeing what's coming next.

428
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,620
But in the case of VR, I think it will remain relatively niche.

429
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,460
Normal people are already scared of how much power their screens have over their daily lives.

430
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,860
If you're going to get them to enter a metaverse of some kind or another, you're going to

431
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,340
have to trick them.

432
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:34,940
That's why the metaverse I choose to smugly predict is on its way, is one based on augmented

433
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,420
reality.

434
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,940
The metaverse won't be a digital world that you can escape into, it'll be a digital

435
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,020
layer that none of us can escape from.

436
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,100
As QR codes plaster the planet and our social lives are mediated by technology, the groundwork

437
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,460
is already being laid.

438
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,500
Pokemon Go already proved that augmented reality could turn the normies into an army

439
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,060
of stampeding zombies competing for the ownership of a digital asset in the form of a Zubat.

440
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,060
Apple and Google are already hard at work on their own AR goggles.

441
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,980
Some might even be released this year, and meta are mapping the world with live maps.

442
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,220
Whether we view it through our phones or a pair of newfangled goggles or a non-invasive

443
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,900
brain chip, one day I think the internet will sort of infect the physical world.

444
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,540
And they'll sell it to us as an escape from the screen.

445
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,460
View a new world with new eyes, new eyes that will sell to you.

446
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,420
That's the future I reckon might be round the corner.

447
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:43,100
So if you don't mind, I'm going to forget about all that and go play some Tetris.

448
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,820
Oh, and if you could like, share and comment, subscribe, all that kind of stuff, that'd

449
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,820
be swell.

450
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,100
I can go this way.

451
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,300
Tetris.
