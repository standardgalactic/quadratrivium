0	8420	Imagine, if you will, a whole new dimension, a brief new world that you can only access
8420	15740	through the medium of a $300 electric blindfold, escape a material world that teeters on ecological
15740	21140	collapse and into a make-believe one where Half-Life 3 came out two years ago.
21140	25780	This virtual world is so immersive that you might not notice when your girlfriend moves
25780	28300	out and takes half the furniture with her.
28300	32380	But don't worry, because the only guys in the metaverse who don't have anime cat
32380	35340	girlfriends are the ones pretending to be them.
35340	40980	But all is not well in this digital paradise, it's being conquered by an artificial intelligence
40980	42820	known as the Zuckerborg.
42820	47180	The Zuckerborg might have convinced you that he birthed the metaverse from his own mind
47180	50900	folds, but its first bricks were laid decades ago.
50900	55140	And if we're going to understand what the metaverse, actually, is, then we're going
55140	64820	to have to understand the dreams and ideals of its reality and deodorant dodging pioneers.
64820	69180	The earliest development in virtual reality actually takes us all the way back to London
69180	71940	in the year of Queen Victoria's coronation.
71940	76860	In 1838, if you wanted to escape the reality in front of your face, you could either visit
76860	82180	an opium den or try out one of Charles Wheatstone's stereoscopes.
82340	86340	Charlie figured out that showing each eye two separate images taken from slightly different
86340	91900	angles gave the illusion of depth, and Victorians first harnessed this eye-tricking tech to
91900	94940	take little head holidays to famous landmarks.
94940	100220	And like nearly all modern VR users, the next thing they wanted to see was some 3D double
100220	102100	Ds.
102100	106940	Stereoscopic pornography was extremely popular, and this would start a trend that we'll see
106940	110420	with pretty much every subsequent virtual reality.
110420	114500	Once someone figured out how to stitch still images together and trick people into thinking
114500	118900	they were going to get hit by a train, the stereoscope was out and cinema was in.
118900	124780	For the next 60 years, a flat screen in a dark room was immersive enough for these 20th century
124780	125780	simpletons.
125780	128220	So there was no need to strap anything to your head.
128220	133980	That was until 1962, when one man was brave enough to ask the question, what if you could
133980	135420	smell movies too?
136420	144100	Morton Highlig was the inventor of the Sensorama machine.
144100	148100	And while its patent diagram might make you think it was designed to cook your head like
148100	153860	a succulent, microwavable meal, it was actually an immersive cinema experience.
153860	160380	In the Sensorama, your head could see, feel and smell five whole films, all farted straight
160380	162380	from Morton's own mind box.
163100	175220	And here, Morton is still leagues ahead of modern VR, where the only thing I can smell
175220	179260	is my own sweaty pits after a vigorous beat saver session.
179260	183060	These though were just the first evolutionary steps in VR.
183060	188460	The hunched over head mounted monkeys who had to walk before we could run straight into
188460	189460	our living room wall.
192380	200140	But in the same year that man walked on the moon, a computer scientist was taking the
200140	202980	first giant leap into virtual reality.
202980	208820	Ivan created a headset attached to a ceiling mounted system called the Sword of Damocles,
208820	212980	which allowed the user to see a virtual environment from different angles without snapping their
212980	214140	neck in half.
214140	218740	While Ivan could be considered the daddy of VR as we know it, his metaverse was nothing
218740	223260	more than a single wire-framed room, which he modestly showed off in this lecture from
223260	224260	1996.
236260	242780	As virtual reality became a reality, its pioneers had to cook up real-world reasons for the
242780	246780	government to spend millions on their made-up fantasy worlds.
246820	252060	By 1985, NASA had given up on sending people to the moon, but they still had enough cash
252060	255860	to spaff on VR motorcycle helmets.
255860	260660	NASA believed these headsets would be used to control robotic vehicles and that VR itself
260660	266140	would be a sort of virtual workstation and three-dimensional data space.
266140	271820	While NASA was limited by the technology of its era, virtual reality was being fully explored
271820	273820	in 1980s fiction.
273820	279900	In 1984, William Gibson published Neuromancer, the first of three novels set in the sprawl,
279900	286140	a science fiction world where drug-addled, sex-mad console cowboys entered a cyberspace
286140	289500	matrix to take on different physical forms.
289500	295740	An anime from 1985 called Megazone 23 also beat the Matrix to the punch with its whole
295740	300580	— actually, you're living in a computer simulation twist — complete with black-suited
300580	304060	agents, computer-simulated women, and some familiar dialogue.
313060	318580	Back in the real world, though, a video game developer and white dude with dreads named
318580	322900	Jaron Lanier was about to push us hard into the Matrix.
322900	328140	After making a ton of cash from developing games like Moondust for the Commodore 64,
328220	335020	Jaron started VPL, Virtual Programming Languages, a company that jump-started the first age
335020	341580	of consumer-focused virtual reality, with products like the Data Glove and the iPhone.
341580	343580	That's eye-like-eye.
343580	345580	That wasn't clear.
345580	350580	Finally, allowing users to finger the blocky inhabitants of the same virtual dimension
350580	354580	where those 90s bowling alley animations must have come from.
354580	359020	If you wanted to slip on a Data Glove, though, it would have cost you about eight grand.
359020	364780	And that doesn't include the $200,000 computer you'd have needed to run a simulation on
364780	365780	an iPhone.
365780	373340	Jaron was, and remains, a dreamer who had deep insights about where the future was going.
373340	377620	And he was as stubbornly committed to the future of virtual reality as he is to his
377700	402700	geeky ass haircut.
402700	407580	Jaron's ambition for VR predicted much of what actually did come to pass.
407580	409500	But they also went far beyond.
409500	414340	As soon as VPL's computers were powerful enough, they created full-body tracking suits
414340	419340	to show the movements of avatars and allowing VPL to live up to their acronym.
419340	424940	Modern VR users are still shackled to these ankle-bracelet things to track full-body movement.
424940	428780	Which is fitting because the only people who really use them are the inhabitants of VR
428780	432660	chat, most of whom should probably be under house arrest.
432660	437300	But naturally, virtual reality's most obvious application is as a tool to act out our most
437300	439820	violent fantasies without consequence.
439820	447700	I'm talking, of course, of video games.
447700	453340	As the World Wide Web went worldwide in the 1990s, the idea of a totally computer-simulated
453340	458020	world seemed a lot less far-fetched, even if some laughed off the internet itself as
458020	459020	a gimmick.
459020	487540	Consumers were finally vicarious.
487540	493180	So companies quickly cobbled together some cheap plastic headsets to strap to their masses.
493180	498420	Although not all of them made it to market, as was the case with Sega's VR glasses,
498420	508660	which got aborted faster than a premature prom night accident.
508660	514500	That same year, Dr. Jonathan Walden had slightly more success with his multiplayer arcade system,
514500	515500	virtuality.
515500	519780	A system where you could shoot each other on an arena of floating chessboards or beat
519780	522340	each other off in a simulated boxing match.
522340	527660	The company just about managed to stay in business throughout most of the 1990s, fuelled
527660	531580	by novelty, hype and a still-priving arcade scene.
531580	535300	But if you wanted to use a VR system that didn't need to be wiped down between each
535300	540420	user, your only option was to get your hands on a Nintendo Virtual Boy.
540420	546540	There was about five left in the country, I found one.
546540	551300	I should probably start by saying that the Virtual Boy wasn't really virtual reality.
551300	557100	It was a headset that was barely more sophisticated than Charlie Wheatstone's stereoscope.
557100	562660	By blasting two separate, slightly different red and black images into your eyeholes, it
562660	567660	created an illusion of depth and a sensation of having your retinas scrubbed with steel
567660	572380	wool, which Nintendo seemed to understand when they advertised it as a creature from
572380	580820	the furb dimension who wanted to give you an aggressive eye exam.
580820	584940	Only 22 games were actually released for the console, and I hear about two of them are
584940	590860	even remotely playable in the hunchback, airport, cavity check position that the console forces
590860	591860	you to play in.
591860	595100	But I'm going to let you in on a secret that you've probably already guessed at.
595100	601420	I have always wanted one of these things, because I am a massive Tetris nerd, and it
601420	608420	is the only console where you can play the worst version of Tetris ever made.
608420	613980	Playing Virtual Boy 3D Tetris is what I imagine it must be like to die on the operating table
613980	616300	while you're having a brain tumour removed.
616300	621380	The overwhelming black space is the incoming darkness, while the incomprehensible mishmash
621500	627340	of transparent red pieces represents the remnants of your threadbare and declining consciousness.
627340	632420	All the while the ghoulish cartoon face of your next piece mocks your every attempt to
632420	634500	escape the hell you're headed for.
634500	640420	The unbearable and increasingly tense 8-bit soundtrack is pumped directly into your ears,
640420	645180	making it feel like you're being forced to solve a Rubik's cube at gunpoint while simultaneously
645180	648660	standing in a German techno club while colour blind.
648660	653580	In summation, I fucking loved it.
653580	659580	Meanwhile the reality dodging dweebs of the VR industry desperately saw novel ways to secure
659580	666580	more funding for the future they were certain was just around a poorly rendered corner.
672740	677140	One successful application was in training simulations to replace learning on the job
677220	682540	where mistakes can be dangerous or prohibitively expensive, like in manufacturing or in surgery
682540	685740	where you can remove someone's spine without consequence.
685740	691420	Other uses though failed to take off, like VR immersion therapy, which was designed to
691420	694540	help users get over their fear of flying.
694540	700100	3D virtual modelling effectively replaced physical modelling in many design-led industries,
700100	704820	though there were still relatively few occasions where viewing it through a headset was better
704900	708300	than looking at it through a really big screen.
708300	712580	But if you're a kid with a data glove then every problem looks like it can be solved
712580	714500	with a bit of digital groping.
714500	719460	The VR community genuinely believed that they could see into the future, and I think even
719460	723460	their wildest, wrongest predictions are quite illuminating.
723460	729380	That when we put this thing on we have bookshelves in various places and they are in the places
729380	733540	where we put them last week or last month or two years ago and we go and get them in
733540	739940	the same way and some of those are encyclopedias and some of those are dictionaries and some
739940	745780	are stacks of transparencies that we put there two years ago, but we carry that with us and
745780	750580	those are just data files that are inside the small thing that hangs on our belt.
750580	756340	By putting on our own four-dimensional hindsight goggles we can see that this guy isn't predicting
756340	760180	the future of VR, he's predicting smartphones.
760180	764260	We do not talk enough, or we talk too much depending on your perspective, about how these
764260	770180	things are already augmented reality devices that have written the logic of the digital
770180	772300	world onto the physical one.
772300	777980	What these guys had literally blinded themselves to was that total immersion only really appeals
777980	782820	to a small cult of consumers who want to escape reality altogether.
782820	788140	Keep that in mind as we enter the next century and the origins of the metaverse, but first
788140	790380	a word from our sponsor.
790380	795420	If you want to surf every corner of the metaverse, you're going to need the bodacious protection
795420	797060	of Surfshark VPN.
797060	802220	Surfshark automatically blocks over one million malicious websites, phishing methods and
802220	803220	other threats.
803220	807780	It also encrypts your data when you choose to unplug from the metaverse, so you can browse
807780	813260	wiki feet on sketchy McDonald's Wi-Fi and no one will be the wiser.
813260	818740	With their tubular noogs policy, Surfshark doesn't keep your data, and it protects
818740	821540	you from the mega corporations who do.
821540	826940	No part of the web is off limits, easily unblock streaming platforms across the world, so I
826940	829820	can keep up with my Indonesian soap operas.
829820	830820	Bagus!
830820	834740	Surfshark is even useful during your shopping trip, keeping you from being the victim of
834740	837260	location-based price discrimination.
837260	843100	One subscription and you can run and install Surfshark on an unlimited number of devices.
843940	851060	With 24-7 customer support and a 30-day money-back guarantee, don't surf without the shark.
851060	858220	Get Surfshark VPN in the link below and use my code, OrdinaryThings, for 83% off and
858220	860300	3 months extra free.
860300	861300	Go on, do it.
861300	863420	They're good, I'll use them.
863420	865420	So what is the metaverse?
865420	870140	Well it depends who you ask and how much money they expect to make from their definition
870140	871740	of it taking off.
871740	876780	The meta wants you to believe that it isn't quite here yet, that it's the next evolutionary
876780	881620	step in the internet's life cycle, specifically the bit in the chart where we go from being
881620	886820	hunched over our screens to launch over our coffee tables.
886820	892020	Parasitic crypto types would have you believe that it's an investment opportunity.
892020	897580	The next gold rush for digital goods, land and services that will all be accessible in
897580	899620	the same cyber casino.
899620	904420	Metaverses argue that the metaverse won't be a head-mounted escape hatch from reality
904420	905420	at all.
905420	910900	Rather, it will be a sort of digital scab that will crust over meat space with the logic
910900	911900	of the internet.
911900	916020	But I'd argue, in a way, the metaverse is already here.
916020	919700	In fact, it's been here for nearly 20 years.
919700	920700	Twist.
922700	927540	The 2000s was a relatively quiet time when it came to VR tech.
927540	931620	The real innovations were saved for those small screens that you can cram in your pocket
931620	933740	and smear with sweet baby rays.
933740	939340	VR headsets looked set to be buried in the 1990s layer of the landfill, right next to
939340	944660	those floral sofas, furbies and copies of the OJ Simpson workout video.
944660	950260	And as the 21st century finally stopped buffering, the first metaverses came online.
950260	955660	Massively multiplayer online games like Second Life, which was called a metaverse during
955660	961420	this Google tech talk, which took place months before Facebook had even launched globally.
961420	964940	Like Hunter said, the basic idea with Second Life was, and it wasn't something that was
964940	969220	possible until five or six years ago to even really start working on, it was this radical
969220	973420	idea that, well, what if you could create a 3D immersive environment that looked as
973420	978900	good as a video game that was tactile and visceral and exciting and sexy, fun to be
978900	984260	in, but had the, of course, very web-like and very compelling property that everything
984260	985780	in it was built by you.
985780	991580	The game itself was released in 2003 to the rabid excitement of anyone who wanted to fuck
991580	992580	the Sims.
992580	997660	Over the course of ten years, its world grew to accommodate over a million active users,
997660	1003900	and its pre-Bitcoin digital currency fueled an economy based on in-game real estate, clothing
1003900	1006020	and customisable genitals.
1006020	1010380	Manpower's virtual world's liaison Dan Darrow and his team have interviewed hundreds
1010380	1015100	of people from over 50 countries in Second Life, sometimes using instant translation
1015100	1017580	devices to communicate.
1017580	1022680	Part of the company's groundbreaking exploration of virtual work includes convening great thinkers
1022680	1024180	in Second Life.
1024180	1028700	Facebook's plan to launch its own cryptocurrency was killed by regulators before they'd even
1028700	1033740	had a chance to fleece people, but all the way back in 2006, Lyndon Dollars had funded
1033740	1038900	the fortune of the internet's first digital land baron, Anshay Chung.
1038900	1044020	The avatar of Aileen Grafe earned millions entirely within Second Life's economy, and
1044020	1045300	she wasn't alone.
1045300	1051460	CNN interviewed these specimens in 2010, who were living off the spoils of their own Second
1051460	1052980	Life real estate empire.
1068900	1081620	It's clear to see that Second Lifeers were living the dream, both on and off screen.
1081620	1091260	In a metaverse that pioneered the play to earn grift before it even had a name, VR didn't
1091260	1098260	make its comeback until 2012, when a 19-year-old named Palmer Lucky posted his plans to escape
1098380	1104620	from reality on Kickstarter.
1104620	1110700	He received $2.5 million, and the attention of anyone who still dreamed of mediating all
1110700	1114020	of their social interactions through a computer screen.
1114020	1142420	It's her one such dreamer, Mark Zuckerberg.
1142420	1149060	2012 was also when Facebook rolled out mobile targeted ads, a decision that would grow the
1149060	1152980	company's profits exponentially for the next 10 years.
1152980	1158500	It crammed ads into the parts of our lives that had hitherto been ad-free.
1158500	1163700	Now companies could reach you at the dinner table, in the elevator, or on the toilet, and
1163700	1165780	the world was better for it.
1165780	1170860	Or at least Mark thought so, but he dreamed of a further invasion, total dominion over
1170860	1172420	the world's eyeballs.
1172420	1179020	Starting small, Mark acquired Instagram for a measly $1 billion, and then two years later
1179020	1184380	spent over three times that amount to acquire Oculus, which tells you everything about what
1184380	1186300	Mark thinks about VR.
1186300	1188260	He is a true believer.
1188260	1193220	Since then, he has been promoting VR as the next step in personal computing.
1193220	1204340	And it's easy to see his lizard brain logic.
1204340	1209060	Computers started off squirrel the way in their own little room, but with the advent of PCs
1209060	1213960	and the smartphone, they've been slowly edging closer and closer to your face.
1213960	1218700	It only makes sense to Mark that humans will eventually end our decade long flirtation
1218700	1226540	with the screen and just bolt them directly to our skull.
1226540	1231940	So his mission for the last decade has been to fast forward this future into the present.
1231940	1238980	Presumably so, he'll never have to make eye contact with any of us again.
1238980	1246540	Since 2016, over 35 VR headsets have been released to a mostly uninterested public, and to a
1246620	1251260	rabid, red-faced cult of consumers who are keeping the industry alive.
1251260	1255580	Personally, I'd say I'm a sort of fringe member of this cult.
1255580	1260340	I'm enthusiastic, but would ultimately duck out the back exit if they started handing
1260340	1261340	out Kool-Aid.
1261340	1266100	For most of us, though, Virtual Reality's main appeal is a gaming experience that's
1266100	1270020	so immersive that it's absolutely fucking nauseating.
1270020	1276940	I'd say VR is the greatest way yet invented to purge that semi-dormant desire for violence
1276940	1279660	that lives inside all of our primate brains.
1279660	1284820	The only reason to play the buggy-as-fuck, unfinished, but incredibly popular blade and
1284820	1291820	sorcery is just how effectively it allows you to satisfy your inner sadist.
1300300	1307300	Best of all, because the screen is only visible to you, no one else can see the grisly game
1308660	1313060	of whack-a-mole that you're playing with a knife and some dude's torso.
1313060	1317700	If you do need to satisfy your bloodlust, though, it's still a lot cheaper to sprinkle
1317700	1322340	broken glass on the beach or poison food at your local homelessness shelter.
1322340	1327540	Most of the best VR games are only playable on an expensive headset that needs to be tethered
1327620	1330100	to an even pricier gaming PC.
1330100	1336060	The Valve Index and every HTC device require you to be tethered to your computer master
1336060	1341020	like the techno-gimp that you are, said the man in the leather jacket, which has really
1341020	1344900	limited their sales and prevented them from reaching widespread appeal.
1344900	1351380	To satisfy consumer curiosity, Oculus funded the Samsung Gear, allowing people to test-drive
1351380	1356460	the function of Virtual Reality by slotting their greasy smartphones into a piece of head-mounted
1356460	1357460	plastic.
1357460	1363140	The smartphone VR sold extremely well for about a year, at which point these devices
1363140	1368380	started gathering dust in garages across the world when people realised they were shit.
1368380	1373500	But their strong sales showed Mark and the wider VR community that this technology would
1373500	1379380	never reach widespread adoption until it was cheap, untethered and not shit.
1379380	1383740	The only headsets that have fulfilled these three criteria are the Oculus Quest and its
1383740	1390060	successor, the Quest 2, which finally offer users the best of both worlds, as it is untethered
1390060	1395820	but you can plug it into a PC if you want to experience good VR games.
1395820	1400900	And its base model is pretty cheap, or at least it's cheaper than an iPhone, or this
1400900	1407300	fucking mental Gucci visor I found, which presumably only appeals to the Goff Centurion
1407300	1409860	who rides horses on weekends.
1409860	1414420	Of course, you look nearly as socially defective wearing one of these in public, but it's
1414420	1419860	obvious why it's dominating the market, it's an amazing piece of tech, totally intuitive
1419860	1427300	and unlike anything on the market at a competing price.
1427300	1432260	Meta don't release their sales figures, but the best independent estimates suggest they
1432260	1435420	have sold over 10 million units this year.
1435420	1439180	And that is largely because people can actually afford them.
1439180	1444700	But Mark and his meta mates are probably losing billions in selling them.
1444700	1451900	I say probably because again, Meta are very secretive about their sales figures and overheads.
1451900	1458420	But their reality labs division that make the headsets have reported massive and metastasizing
1458420	1459420	losses.
1459420	1466420	Mark is doing this because he knows that widespread VR adoption needs to happen before big developers
1466420	1489340	will sink money into software.
1489340	1495660	It is hugely unlikely that Meta is making anything close to a profit with these headsets,
1495660	1499100	and it is still light years from mainstream adoption.
1499100	1504580	With Meta's other services showing signs of declining cultural relevance, the metaverse
1504580	1508700	is an enormous gamble for Mark to hedge his entire company on.
1508700	1513660	So Mark is bankrolling the entire consumer VR sector.
1513660	1518780	Without his initial investment in Oculus, the funding of smartphone tech or the Kamikaze
1519220	1524420	Oculus price tag, the whole industry would still just be a techy niche.
1524420	1529260	He has spent the last five years trying to sell VR as something more than a head-mounted
1529260	1530860	entertainment system.
1530860	1536260	Like in this bizarre presentation, where he appeared as a Wii Sports avatar in a disaster
1536260	1541780	zone to promote VR as some kind of empathy machine, while still lacking enough human
1541780	1554100	connection to pull off a convincing high-five.
1554100	1559180	More recently, Mark has tried to suck all the fun out of VR by promoting the Virtual
1559180	1560740	Reality Office.
1560740	1566100	To most people, having your workstation beamed into your eyes is a bit like having your brain
1566100	1567540	taken hostage.
1567540	1572220	Why anyone would suffer through the eye and neck strain of having a monitor attached to
1572220	1577060	your face when a screen or two do just as well is beyond me.
1577060	1578540	I don't think anyone's convinced.
1578540	1582460	I've scoured the internet and I have not found one piece of footage where people are
1582460	1594380	at Facebook HQ doing their work with a fucking Oculus strap to their head.
1594380	1600300	Then there's the Virtual Collaborative Office, which I think has only found supporters thanks
1600300	1604620	to pandemic-era brain rot disguised as innovation.
1604620	1610540	In a few years, these scenes will look as batshit as those water gun baptisms do now.
1610540	1616340	Meta's idea of a virtual workspace isn't completely off base, though.
1616340	1622380	The VR industry's main source of revenue, other than entertainment, is in enterprise.
1622380	1625340	Not much has changed since the 1990s.
1625340	1630460	It's still mostly used for highly specific scenarios where employees are being trained
1630460	1633060	to work in physical environments.
1633060	1638020	There are also training simulators that teach you how to do the soft-handed tasks of white-collar
1638020	1644740	workers too, like this one from Tailspin that teaches you how to fire an old man named Barry
1644740	1658420	and emotionally cope as you watch the life drain from his eyes.
1658420	1664100	Although it seems pretty limited, I fired Barry over and over and over again, and while
1664100	1669300	it did finally satisfy my need for virtual sadism, it didn't teach me what to do if
1669300	1676620	he showed up the next day with a bad attitude at an AR-15.
1676620	1681780	While Mark has been busy trying to show the world that VR is more than a neat toy, other
1681780	1686260	companies have been busy building their own mini metaverses.
1686260	1692940	These are game worlds or virtual experiences where you can make friends, explore user-generated
1692940	1695980	content and hopefully make some cash.
1695980	1700740	So for the last few weeks, I've been travelling the metaverse, trying to discover the future
1700740	1702740	and maybe myself.
1702740	1709340	But as far as I can see, it is mostly occupied by free main groups, children, crypto bros
1709340	1711340	and the sexually peculiar.
1711340	1715300	No judgement, but that's maybe free groups that you don't want hanging out in the same
1715300	1716300	space.
1716300	1722780	The most cynical metaverse type thing going on right now is Decentraland, a play-to-earn
1722780	1725540	metaverse built on the blockchain.
1725540	1730060	Try saying that word-salad sentence to someone who isn't terminally online and they'll
1730060	1733300	look at you like they just walk in on you, beating your sabre.
1733300	1739140	Despite this 2017 advertisement, Decentraland is currently still desktop only.
1739140	1745820	With shit-tier visuals, broken environments and nothing to do other than buy stuff, Decentraland's
1745820	1749540	main appeal is that it's an investment opportunity.
1749540	1755460	Plots of virtual real estate sell for thousands, sometimes millions, mostly to companies who
1755460	1759060	can afford to take a gamble on something so speculative.
1759060	1764860	J.P. Morgan has even opened its own branch in Decentraland, tucked away somewhere between
1764860	1769380	the crypto casinos and NFT art galleries.
1769380	1774820	During my travels in Decentraland, I saw just as many adverts trying to sell land as people
1774820	1776580	actually building stuff on it.
1776580	1781740	The fact that one of the only things to do in Decentraland is blow wads of crypto, a
1781740	1787300	cyber casino under the judgemental eyes of Pepe LeFrog tells you everything you need
1787300	1791100	to know about this metaverse and its inhabitants.
1791100	1797740	To their credit, Decentraland did try to spice things up with a metaverse rave back in December,
1797740	1801540	but it looked about as much fun as getting a root canal at the Holocaust Museum.
1801540	1808460	A real metaverse needs meaningful interaction, immersion and a successful simulation of something
1808460	1813580	that users can't get in the real world, which is why I can no longer avoid talking
1813580	1818860	about VRChat.
1818860	1823820	Depending on the stats you read, VRChat might be the most continuously popular community
1823820	1829500	in virtual reality, even though most users don't actually access this world with a
1829500	1830500	headset.
1830500	1834780	It's a game that has no objective other than socialization.
1834780	1841700	Users inhabit strange characters in user-generated worlds and simulate acts that are an abomination
1841700	1842700	before God.
1842700	1847580	And annoyingly, I must argue that this is genuinely groundbreaking.
1847580	1853260	Fifteen years ago, Second Life pioneered cyber sex when it allowed its users to customize
1853260	1856580	their balls and visit cyber brothels.
1856580	1861700	Some even found love, but injured even after they discovered their partner wasn't actually
1861700	1864260	a foreboobed succubus from Mars.
1864260	1869900	But VRChat's passionate community is now using cutting-edge tech and their degenerate
1869900	1875260	imaginations to take cyber sex to brave new heights.
1875260	1880960	Erotic Roleplay, or ERC, is a large part of VRChat's culture.
1880960	1887060	One thing I learnt during my travels in this metaverse is that you must stay away from
1887060	1894020	fur hub or club meeker if you value your sanity and or virtual personal space.
1894020	1899660	In this seventh circle of virtual hell, I found rooms that can be locked for privacy.
1899660	1905900	Custom avatars that were extremely unsafe for work and people using body tracking tech
1905900	1910460	to turn jerking off in front of their computer monitor into a performance art.
1910460	1916980	The VRChat community's commitment to debasing themselves has meant that it is now unmistakably
1916980	1921740	the most immersive social experience in all of virtual reality.
1921740	1926020	Users are so attached to their avatars that it's just as common to see crowds of users
1926020	1930820	standing in front of in-game mirrors as it is to see someone getting straddled by a wolf.
1930820	1935900	There is also a small community who sleep with their headsets on, aiming to wake up
1935900	1937940	immersed in the virtual world.
1937940	1942420	Some have become so immersed in this world that they allege they can feel the touch of
1942420	1946740	other users, a sensation they call phantom touch.
1946740	1951540	But considering one of the other things that VRChat is famous for is kids screaming into
1951540	1955740	the mic and running around these worlds, I'm a little worried about who's getting phantom
1955740	1957620	touched if you get what I'm saying.
1957620	1962340	While researching all this has made me want to cry in the shower, it shows you just how
1962340	1966740	immersive virtual reality has become for its most devoted users.
1966740	1972660	But its alienating weirdness also demonstrates how far it is from any kind of widespread
1972660	1978220	adoption.
1978220	1983780	Since Mark announced Facebook's desperate meta makeover in December, he has been pushing
1983780	1987700	his own brand metaverse, Horizon Worlds.
1987700	1992940	It's clear that it's been designed to appeal to a broader audience, and it's doing this
1992940	2000020	partly by alienating the kind of users who already love VR and make its worlds come alive.
2000020	2004060	First of all, there are no furries allowed in Mark's metaverse.
2004060	2008820	No, only floating torsos that are supposed to look like you after you've stood on a
2008820	2010220	landmine.
2010220	2015540	Having legs is a frequent cause of complication in other social VR apps.
2015540	2021660	This keeps Mark's world less janky, but it also conveniently keeps it free of genitals.
2021660	2026820	Although this hasn't stopped early testers reporting sexual harassment in Mark's brave
2026820	2032180	new world, forcing meta to hastily give people the power to set up their own little safe
2032180	2036660	space so no one can fondle the empty space where their balls would be.
2036660	2043140	In Horizon Worlds there are also no kids allowed, which, to be fair, is a really good idea.
2043140	2047620	One of the main complaints that a lot of users have with other social VR apps is that they're
2047620	2052820	filled with more screaming, unwanted children than an orphanage for arsonists.
2052820	2058460	But despite meta's 18 plus policy, their world is no exception to this.
2058460	2072060	With microphone-abusing infants somehow managing to bypass Mark's airtight security system.
2072060	2077300	The creator tools in Horizon Worlds are supposed to be inclusive too, and they are.
2077300	2079220	They're impressively easy to use.
2079580	2099460	This will allow more people to get creative, but their limitations will result in flat,
2099460	2103580	uninteresting lands with repetitive interactive features.
2103580	2108580	This will kill the service in the long run, as talented world builders will be attracted
2108660	2113740	to similar apps that are harder to use but are more rewarding.
2113740	2117860	Sometimes it looks like Mark has shot himself in the foot with the starting pistol before
2117860	2119420	the race had even begun.
2119420	2125020	To achieve profitability, the metaverse and VR needs to reach widespread adoption.
2125020	2129460	And honestly, I'm not sure I see that ever happening, but it certainly won't happen
2129460	2133980	if meta continues to alienate the people who already love VR.
2133980	2138580	Although if their latest Super Bowl ad is anything to go by, meta have realised the
2138580	2144420	error of their ways, and will soon be letting the furries fly their freak flag any day now.
2147180	2152900	I think that Mark Zuckerberg has fallen for the same fallacy that the VR creators of old
2152900	2153980	did.
2153980	2159380	They think that once the tech improves, once the screens get clearer and the headsets get
2159460	2162420	lighter, then everyone will be into VR.
2162420	2169340	Whether it's virtual reality, crypto or AI, smug, nerdy early adopters love to pat themselves
2169340	2171900	on the back about seeing what's coming next.
2171900	2176620	But in the case of VR, I think it will remain relatively niche.
2176620	2182460	Normal people are already scared of how much power their screens have over their daily lives.
2182460	2186860	If you're going to get them to enter a metaverse of some kind or another, you're going to
2186860	2188340	have to trick them.
2188340	2194940	That's why the metaverse I choose to smugly predict is on its way, is one based on augmented
2194940	2196420	reality.
2196420	2201940	The metaverse won't be a digital world that you can escape into, it'll be a digital
2201940	2205020	layer that none of us can escape from.
2205020	2211100	As QR codes plaster the planet and our social lives are mediated by technology, the groundwork
2211100	2212460	is already being laid.
2212460	2217500	Pokemon Go already proved that augmented reality could turn the normies into an army
2217500	2224060	of stampeding zombies competing for the ownership of a digital asset in the form of a Zubat.
2224060	2229060	Apple and Google are already hard at work on their own AR goggles.
2229060	2234980	Some might even be released this year, and meta are mapping the world with live maps.
2234980	2240220	Whether we view it through our phones or a pair of newfangled goggles or a non-invasive
2240220	2246900	brain chip, one day I think the internet will sort of infect the physical world.
2246900	2250540	And they'll sell it to us as an escape from the screen.
2250540	2255460	View a new world with new eyes, new eyes that will sell to you.
2255460	2259420	That's the future I reckon might be round the corner.
2259420	2263100	So if you don't mind, I'm going to forget about all that and go play some Tetris.
2263100	2267820	Oh, and if you could like, share and comment, subscribe, all that kind of stuff, that'd
2267820	2268820	be swell.
2268820	2270100	I can go this way.
2276900	2278300	Tetris.
