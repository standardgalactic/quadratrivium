0	6000	Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth. It really is nature's fuel.
6000	13000	We're at a very interesting stage of development of this technology where it's not quite ready for prime time, but it's getting tantalizingly close.
13000	17000	Fuel cell technology is evolving, the technology is improving constantly.
17000	23000	We're competing in a market that we have to compete with batteries and generators, and how do we do this?
23000	29000	I think hydrogen has great potential to become one of our primary fuels for the transportation industry in the future.
29000	33000	I would much rather drive my fuel cell vehicle than my gasoline vehicle.
33000	40000	Funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory,
40000	48000	the Energy and Environmental Research Center's National Center for Hydrogen Technology, and the members of Prairie Public.
49000	59000	You've probably heard something about hydrogen. You may know hydrogen can be used to fuel cars,
59000	65000	but did you know that hydrogen is used safely all around you every day?
65000	74000	In data centers, warehouses, golf courses, and even breweries. Hydrogen is nature's fuel.
74000	78000	It can be made where you want, when you want.
78000	83000	Imagine living in a world without concerns about energy security or pollution,
83000	87000	where you can get all the energy you need from domestic sources.
87000	94000	Imagine the world of fuel cells using safe, clean, abundant hydrogen.
94000	108000	This is actually an electric car. It's got an electric motor in the front that drives the car forward,
108000	118000	and it gets most of its electricity from a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen from the air into electricity and water as a waste product.
119000	123000	The concept of the fuel cell has been around 150 years as a sort of chemical principle.
123000	129000	Starting about the 60s, these devices were made for space, and over about the last 15 years, automakers have been working very hard
129000	137000	to develop the technology for automobiles as a way of simultaneously reducing the use of oil, reducing air pollution,
137000	140000	and also reducing the release of greenhouse gases.
140000	144000	This type of fuel cell is called a PEM fuel cell, proton exchange membrane.
144000	149000	What I like to explain it is sort of like a sandwich, where in the middle of the sandwich, the meat of the sandwich, if you will,
149000	153000	you have a membrane material. You have hydrogen on one side, and you have platinum as a catalyst material.
153000	158000	That catalyst allows the hydrogen molecule to split apart into protons and electrons.
158000	162000	The protons go through the membrane, the electrons have to go around the membrane,
162000	166000	and as those electrons are going around the membrane, they're powering the electric motor.
166000	170000	Everything meets on the side with the oxygen and forms water as the waste product.
170000	174000	Sometimes you'll hear it called a fuel cell stack, because it's a whole stack of these fuel cells,
174000	178000	just like you stack batteries together in a flashlight to build up more voltage.
178000	184000	A car like this, you might have 400 fuel cells all stacked together to give you a few hundred volts.
187000	196000	Currently, we produce in the world over 50 million tons of hydrogen, with about a fifth of that being consumed in the United States.
196000	203000	That hydrogen is being used primarily as a feedstock for making agricultural products such as fertilizer,
203000	212000	and also a chemical feedstock to take the petroleum in its raw form and make it into the petroleum that we use in either diesel or gasoline.
212000	219000	It's also used for medical applications, food processing, a variety of smaller type uses.
219000	225000	If you look down the road in the hydrogen economy, some of those uses are for transportation,
225000	230000	such as forklifts in a warehouse, or even putting electricity onto the grid.
230000	239000	As always, when you start going into new markets, it becomes difficult for commercial companies to invest in something that's years out.
239000	246000	That's why we have programs like the National Center for Hydrogen Technology, where you have some government support,
246000	249000	because that federal support helps bridge that gap.
249000	258000	With that, we work closely with commercial partners, and we find opportunities to provide developments in terms of being more effective,
258000	266000	lower cost, better environmental advantages, and these are all things that are helping to buoy the hydrogen economy.
266000	274000	As we go down this path and we get those goals met, we start grabbing more and more market opportunities.
274000	282000	It becomes a matter of greatly reducing the cost of producing the hydrogen as well, the fuel cells, and also the end uses.
282000	287000	And we then reach more and more applications, and we see it accelerating.
287000	291000	And as that happens, you get the benefit of more public buy-in.
291000	296000	The more they're familiar with technology, the more they want it, and the more they're interested.
296000	304000	We see some very significant technological evolution taking place, which says that hydrogen can be exceptionally competitive,
304000	310000	and we firmly believe that the ultimate energy source in this world is going to be hydrogen.
318000	321000	Hydrogen is interesting. It can be made a lot of different ways.
321000	324000	There's a lot of domestic resources that can be used to make hydrogen.
324000	328000	Any source of electricity can be used to make hydrogen from water.
328000	334000	Hydrogen can also be made through a lot of biomass pathways, and right now it's made a lot from natural gas, which is not ultimately sustainable,
334000	339000	but it's sort of a bridge technology to potentially getting to cleaner sources of hydrogen in the future.
339000	346000	To get hydrogen from water, we can use electricity to break the chemical bonds between oxygen and hydrogen.
346000	349000	This process is called electrolysis.
350000	356000	Hydrogenics is a global leader in the development of fuel cells and on-site hydrogen generation.
356000	359000	We can provide the hydrogen stations that produce the hydrogen.
359000	362000	The process starts with the electrolyzer. That's where we make the hydrogen.
362000	367000	We take city water and we purify it and put that inside our electrolyzers.
367000	372000	From then, the water is electrolyzed. We produce hydrogen and oxygen.
372000	375000	Oxygen is vented and hydrogen is captured.
375000	379000	It is then purified through our dryer and purifier.
379000	390000	The purifier removes any trace oxygen inside hydrogen stream and the dryer removes any moisture that was left over from the electrolysis process.
390000	398000	The gas comes out at about 150 psi from then on it's compressed to 6000 psi where it's stored into storage tanks.
398000	402000	From the storage tanks, the gas is diverted into the dispenser.
405000	413000	Most of the hydrogen we have today comes from natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming.
413000	419000	I would say about 90% of the world's hydrogen comes from fossil fuels from reforming natural gas.
419000	427000	For that, you need the capital cost of millions of dollars to create your plant and you produce thousands of kilograms in one day.
427000	432000	We can get hydrogen from coal through gasification.
433000	438000	We've been using coal in this country for many, many years and primarily it's been combusted.
438000	442000	We burn the coal and we essentially convert it entirely to heat.
442000	447000	In a gasification system, we convert coal to something very similar to natural gas.
447000	457000	Then that natural gas has an extremely high hydrogen content and we can then take that and either manipulate it to pure hydrogen or we can even produce liquid fuels from it.
457000	465000	Gasification has the promise of being one of the few sources that we can use to produce very, very large quantities of hydrogen.
465000	472000	So as we transition to a hydrogen economy, coal is one of those domestic resources that can really step in.
472000	476000	We believe very strongly that coal must remain a part of our energy future.
476000	480000	In order to do that, we have to find the technologies to utilize it more efficiently and effectively.
480000	493000	We're convinced that because of our experience and knowledge that we've gained from our decoder gasification project that we have a way in which to find a solution to this very challenging issue for our continued ability to utilize coal.
494000	497000	Hydrogen today is something we look to for the future.
497000	507000	If you want to talk about renewables, you've got to find a way in which to store the energy because electrical energy has to be used at the time it's produced.
508000	514000	And with renewables, you don't have that opportunity because when the wind is blowing, you may not have the load.
514000	517000	And so if you're producing it, how do we store it?
517000	520000	The hydrogen concept is one of those opportunities.
529000	532000	A hydrogen generation can happen through a number of different routes.
532000	541000	The easiest route would have us making electricity and then using that electricity to run an electrolyzer which would split water electrochemically.
541000	550000	We can also drive chemical processes which could then be used to produce fuels such as hydrogen or even liquid hydrocarbon fuels.
550000	555000	Solar typically only works when the sun is up. Wind only works when the wind is blowing.
555000	560000	When the sun goes down, then you have to make up all that solar power with other sources.
560000	564000	Or if the wind is blowing and suddenly it stops, it causes instabilities.
564000	566000	I need that power whenever there's a demand.
566000	572000	The ability to store power is key to large-scale deployment because it removes that instability.
575000	584000	In the same way hydrogen stores the energy from the sun and wind, we can use hydrogen to store the energy in moving water.
585000	591000	Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it's not readily available in a usable form.
591000	594000	As a result, it has to be manufactured.
594000	599000	The good news about hydrogen is it can be manufactured in a variety of ways and with a large array of feedstocks.
599000	605000	Liquid hydrogen in general first came to the United States as part of the space program and it was large.
605000	609000	Government support for that program helped subsidize the first plants.
609000	612000	Lindy is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies.
612000	615000	Most of Lindy's hydrogen comes from this plant here in Magog, Quebec.
615000	622000	This plant utilizes a hydrogen waste stream that comes from a sodium chloride plant across the street.
622000	630000	That plant takes a brine, electrolyzes it, makes sodium chloride and a 97% hydrogen waste stream.
630000	637000	Lindy captures that hydrogen stream and uses hydroelectric power to purify it and liquefy it for delivery across the country.
638000	647000	Essentially, the plant here uses electricity as the driving force to compress and liquefy the hydrogen.
647000	657000	Our electricity, fortunately in Quebec, is essentially 97% comes from hydroelectricity, which is a renewable resource.
658000	667000	For green hydrogen, I'd say it's hydrogen that's produced with zero or minimal greenhouse gas or other pollutants as byproducts.
667000	676000	Other renewable ways of making hydrogen is to capture solar, wind, wave, geothermal power and electrolyze water to produce hydrogen.
676000	684000	We produce hydrogen in a very environmentally friendly way because of the fact that we have hydroelectric power.
684000	692000	However, we have to transport that hydrogen and the transportation does have an impact in terms of the carbon footprint.
692000	698000	The reason we liquefy hydrogen is it's perhaps the most sufficient way to distribute hydrogen over long distances.
698000	703000	And you can deliver the most hydrogen with the lowest carbon footprint as a liquid.
703000	711000	Currently, there's three traditional ways of storing hydrogen as largely dependent upon the volume of hydrogen you want to store
711000	714000	and how far you want to transport it.
714000	720000	So if you need a couple of kilograms of hydrogen, typically steel cylinders is what you would use.
720000	726000	When we get to a few hundred kilograms of hydrogen, we look to employ stainless steel tube trailers.
726000	732000	When you get to larger, maybe several hundred to several thousand kilograms of hydrogen consumption,
732000	735000	that's where liquid hydrogen becomes highly economical.
735000	739000	Beyond that is when you have to seriously start thinking about an on-site production.
739000	745000	We know hydrogen can be delivered, compressed and dispensed into vehicles very safely,
745000	748000	as safely if not more safely than traditional fuels.
748000	752000	Just as electricity is an energy carrier, so is hydrogen.
752000	759000	Hydrogen is an excellent way to transport energy in a usable form that can be fed to a fuel cell
759000	761000	and generate electricity where you need it, when you need it.
761000	765000	So whether you're moving your vehicles or you're lighting your house or heating your homes,
765000	770000	one of the beauties of hydrogen will be able to provide a common energy currency throughout the world.
770000	776000	In a hydrogen economy, every area of the world will be able to generate this currency with the resources available to it.
776000	782000	Hydrogen is produced today in large scales at economies that would make sense for hydrogen fueling.
782000	787000	So we're confident that industry can respond and that is largely with the infrastructure.
787000	792000	Fueling stations that are fueling tens or hundreds of cars instead of thousands of cars.
792000	794000	Obviously the infrastructure is very similar.
794000	800000	What you need to fuel one car is pretty much the same equipment you need to fuel a hundred cars or a thousand cars.
805000	808000	When it comes to hydrogen refueling, there is quite a big difference.
808000	812000	I'd rather fill out a hydrogen fueling station than a gasoline station,
812000	817000	due to the fact that gasoline stations have been developed from the 1940s and 50s.
817000	820000	Many of the standards and many of the safety standards have been grandfathered in.
820000	826000	When we look at development of standards, we're looking at what is safe to fuel with the knowledge that we know today,
826000	829000	not from what we knew earlier.
829000	835000	With this knowledge, we're able to ensure that we design fully safe hydrogen stations.
835000	839000	Cross-global is primarily an alternate fuel dispenser manufacturer.
839000	846000	So that would encase propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and very soon liquefied natural gas.
846000	852000	We got quite a good head start in targeting from South America, Middle East, Europe, Asia,
852000	855000	80% of our business would be outside of North America.
855000	858000	At Cross, we're primarily an assembler and tester.
858000	862000	Mainly the components come into our factory, assembled into sub-assemblies,
862000	866000	and they move down the line to where they finally get put into the dispenser.
866000	871000	You do some final wiring, tubing, moves on to the test bay.
871000	873000	Every unit is tested fully.
873000	877000	And once it's approved, out the door to the end customer.
877000	882000	When the public sees hydrogen at a station, they see the dispenser.
882000	889000	They don't often see the storage or the compression or any of the other equipment that's very vital,
889000	892000	but it's hidden from the public's point of view.
892000	898000	Hydrogen is about the vehicle that they're driving and the dispenser that they're filling it at.
898000	904000	To compare a hydrogen dispenser to a gasoline dispenser, you can't pump a gas.
904000	908000	You have to move it on a basis of pressure differential.
908000	917000	So instead of a pump that draws fluid out, you have a valving that opens and closes to control the flow of gas to the vehicle.
917000	925000	Instead of a turbine meter and a gasoline dispenser that spins to give you a reading on volume,
925000	930000	you have a mass flow meter which senses the molecules of hydrogen flowing through it
930000	933000	and gives you that same mass reading on the display.
933000	938000	One of the challenges with any new energy is distribution.
938000	942000	In particular, the gasoline stations already exist.
942000	947000	You're trying to compete with something that has been built up over 100 years.
947000	956000	Initially, there will be hydrogen projects where buses return to a depot of fuel at night
956000	963000	or where you have the forklifts operating under one roof at a warehouse.
963000	968000	The biggest barrier right now is probably the lack of vehicles.
968000	972000	Now, if you talk to an OEM vehicle manufacturer, they'll say the biggest barrier is the lack of stations.
972000	975000	I'd say we're both right. It's a chicken and egg challenge.
975000	978000	Do you bring out the vehicles first or do you bring the stations out first?
978000	980000	Well, you need both.
980000	984000	You'll see reports that have suggested that it's going to cost up to a trillion dollars
984000	991000	to develop a new fueling infrastructure if we're going to deploy hydrogen in this country.
991000	994000	The truth of the matter is that is totally wrong.
994000	998000	The ERC has developed a technology called hydrogen on demand.
998000	1003000	And what it is is we can use a wide variety of feedstocks, which are readily available,
1003000	1007000	to produce hydrogen as you're filling your vehicle.
1007000	1013000	No more than you need to fill it, produces it on the spot in real time while you're filling the vehicle.
1013000	1018000	It eliminates the cost of pressurizing the hydrogen, major cost out of the picture.
1018000	1022000	Secondly, we eliminate the need for storage, another big cost out of the picture.
1022000	1028000	Third key thing, we can use just about every existing gas station in this country for this technology.
1028000	1034000	And you can drive up to that station, you can buy gasoline, you can buy an ethanol blend, you can buy diesel, you can buy hydrogen.
1041000	1047000	Our mission basically is to develop power systems that generate electricity
1047000	1058000	because we firmly believe that electricity will be moving people around in the next wave of mobility for humankind.
1060000	1064000	In product development, like all companies in a clean energy space,
1064000	1071000	we're trying to deliver on the three promises, which are energy security, environmental quality, and economic opportunity.
1071000	1075000	Novera got started by combining two emerging technologies.
1075000	1081000	On one side, the hydrogen generation technology through reforming,
1081000	1092000	and the fuel cell stack technology, the electrochemical device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity.
1092000	1096000	PowerTap is our on-site hydrogen generation product,
1096000	1101000	which supplies on-site hydrogen to customers, forklifts, and fuel cell vehicles.
1101000	1106000	The PowerTap on-site hydrogen generator is designed to operate off of natural gas.
1106000	1109000	We do this because it's a readily available fuel.
1109000	1117000	There's over 2 million miles of pipeline within the United States going to 69 million customers today.
1117000	1122000	We're using the same natural gas that you are in your home running your boiler, running your hot water heater.
1122000	1124000	Nothing is different.
1124000	1128000	This box, we like to call it actually a hydrogen generation appliance.
1128000	1133000	We've taken large-scale industrial process and intensified it.
1133000	1137000	We have natural gas and city water come in on the utility side.
1137000	1141000	It gets conditioned and then is sent to a steam methane reformer.
1141000	1145000	It combines the steam as city water, combines the natural gas,
1145000	1150000	and it breaks the bonds into a hydrogen-rich stream, which in the industry we call syngas.
1150000	1156000	After that fuel processing, it goes to a purification step where we get high-purity hydrogen,
1156000	1159000	which is required for our fuel cell stacks.
1159000	1162000	Inside this canister is our steam methane reformer.
1162000	1167000	It is taking the fuel and city water, it's converting the both into the syngas.
1167000	1172000	We do sell these to both warehouses that are using forklift trucks,
1172000	1175000	and also we're looking at opportunities to do merchant hydrogen,
1175000	1179000	which is generating hydrogen for outright sale of the gas.
1179000	1186000	The hydrogen refueling system that we have developed is based on the reformation of natural gas, reacting with water.
1186000	1190000	There's a lot of critics of this approach because we're using a carbon-based fuel.
1190000	1197000	While it's not totally carbon-free, it's an obvious choice as a part of the roadmap to carbon reduction.
1198000	1203000	The stack on top you see is a commercially available stack that goes into our power-edge systems.
1203000	1208000	These are systems that are provided to the material handling market as battery replacements.
1208000	1212000	What's intended for industrial heavy-duty industrial applications.
1212000	1219000	The real advantage of fuel cells over other power plant type technologies is they are inherently scalable.
1219000	1224000	So if I need a stack of just one kilowatt, there it is.
1224000	1228000	If I need this stack to be 90 kilowatts, I simply add cells to it.
1228000	1233000	In terms of the prime power plant, the prime energy converter, it's real, it's today, we're doing it.
1233000	1237000	They're ready, they're reliable, we're deploying them in fork trucks.
1237000	1242000	The fork truck market is an ideal proving ground because it's a vehicle that's already electrified.
1242000	1249000	It already uses batteries and we're proving that the fuel cell has value in displacing batteries in that application.
1249000	1257000	This system is designed so that the user can push out the lead acid battery, put in our system and the truck doesn't know the difference.
1257000	1263000	It's a hybrid system which has, instead of the gasoline-powered engine, we have a fuel cell engine,
1263000	1270000	which actually is one of the nice points about fuel cells with the growth of hybrid technology in over-the-road vehicles.
1270000	1275000	You can very easily see how you could take the internal combustion engine out and put a fuel cell in.
1275000	1282000	In the traditional power supply system for electric forklifts, you have big racks and racks of lead acid batteries.
1282000	1289000	For every truck you have up to three batteries and when the battery dies, you have to take it to a specialized machine
1289000	1293000	that pulls the battery out, puts it up on a rack to be charged and puts a new battery in.
1293000	1294000	All this is very time intensive.
1294000	1298000	A battery takes eight hours to charge and eight hours to cool.
1298000	1300000	This system takes about two minutes to refuel.
1300000	1302000	This is a fuel cell stack.
1302000	1306000	This is what I call the dry end of the system because there's no water.
1306000	1308000	This is the wet end.
1308000	1311000	There's a condenser here for managing heat and water.
1311000	1314000	So as a fuel cell runs, it creates water.
1314000	1319000	This manages the water to keep it from getting too high or too low and also rejects the heat.
1319000	1326000	Also in here we have the fuel handling components that take the very high pressure from the tank and step it down.
1326000	1332000	There's an onboard computer which allows the fuel cell system to provide you with intelligent power.
1332000	1334000	A lead acid battery is just a dumb battery.
1334000	1338000	It can't tell you anything about how healthy it is or how productive the operator is
1338000	1342000	and what it will do is it will just slowly drain down in performance over the course of the shift
1342000	1344000	just like a flashlight that's going dim.
1344000	1347000	What you find with these is you'll have consistent power.
1347000	1356000	When you talk about family cars or SUVs, batteries will be too heavy and too bulky to be deployed and too expensive.
1356000	1364000	To put a battery in a mini van today, you would have to add about 450 pounds.
1364000	1368000	And that's carrying a gorilla inside your car.
1368000	1373000	It's an invisible gorilla but nobody wants a gorilla in addition to the car you have.
1373000	1380000	That's where the fuel cell will come in and will have the right substitute in that case.
1387000	1394000	This is the world's first automated fuel cell assembly line.
1394000	1397000	We can do a thousand cells a day.
1397000	1399000	Some of our stacks require about 50 cells.
1399000	1406000	The reason for doing the line is, again, we're competing in a market that we have to compete with batteries and generators.
1406000	1407000	And how do we do this?
1407000	1413000	One of the things that we found in order to compete in a world market is we can't have exotic materials.
1413000	1421000	We figured out how we could design this in such a way that we could build it with robotics that are the same as the auto industry,
1421000	1423000	that are the same in the computer industry.
1423000	1430000	Not exotics, not the super titanium, it's not the stuff that is just very, very costly high expenses.
1430000	1434000	But we found low-cost materials that we could go ahead and put these together with.
1434000	1440000	Everything that is readily available wherever we need to to become a global competitor.
1440000	1444000	What we're building today, we're actually finding those marks that we can go into.
1444000	1451000	The telecom industry, the data centers, those backup supports that we need that would replace the battery or the generator.
1451000	1455000	So right away, we're going to go ahead and drive to those newer markets.
1455000	1459000	This happens to be a 1,000-watt system that we've created.
1459000	1461000	This is a 5,000-watt system.
1461000	1463000	We have communications.
1463000	1467000	We can actually, from a remote distance, if the fuel gets to a certain level,
1467000	1472000	we can go ahead and have this unit call the fuel provider and have them go ahead and say,
1472000	1476000	hey, fuel's low, come and take care of it before the incident happens,
1476000	1480000	before you start running this unit and all of a sudden you find out that you're out of fuel.
1480000	1486000	And this is just conventional batteries that you see quite often in data centers and telecom systems.
1486000	1492000	Just like any common generator, it takes, in some generators, it may take two, three minutes to come on.
1492000	1496000	We can come on within about five seconds, three to five seconds.
1496000	1497000	Or an instant.
1497000	1504000	But in order not to lose that power, we bridge it with a small battery for a short period of time.
1504000	1505000	I can demonstrate this.
1505000	1508000	We turn on these really super bright lights here.
1508000	1512000	And right now, the fuel cell is armed and it's watching the grid.
1512000	1516000	And it's intelligent enough to see if the grid starts to drop.
1516000	1518000	The fuel cell knows that it's time to come on.
1518000	1521000	As soon as we shut off the power, the grid is there.
1521000	1524000	The fuel cell's armed.
1524000	1527000	Fuel cell immediately knew to come on because it lost the power.
1527000	1531000	It no longer has any power, but you didn't see any blinks in the light whatsoever.
1531000	1532000	Not one.
1532000	1536000	There's all kinds of opportunities that are open to what the fuel cell has to offer.
1536000	1540000	It's open for the imagination.
1540000	1543000	This is a thousand watt system right here.
1543000	1545000	It's a unit that we can use outdoors.
1545000	1549000	This is the one that actually Governor Schwarzenegger used to light his Christmas tree every year.
1549000	1554000	Normally a 60-foot Christmas tree that had at one time 5,000 watt light bulbs on it
1554000	1558000	and consumed about 25,000 watts of power.
1558000	1561000	We were able to come back through, talk to them about that,
1561000	1565000	change their way of looking at it, put LED lights on this unit,
1565000	1571000	ended up dropping the consumption from 25,000 watts down to 450 watts.
1571000	1576000	And we were able to use it with a small little thousand watt fuel cell system that we have here.
1576000	1580000	So every year he delights in the fact that he's running a Christmas tree
1580000	1585000	cost-effectively and showing that there's other alternatives to power.
1585000	1589000	This is green and that's the great and wonderful thing about this is
1589000	1597000	it's zero pollution, low noise, plus a tremendous amount of energy and a very small package.
1597000	1598000	These are real.
1598000	1602000	These are pieces of equipment we're going to see being used on a daily basis.
1602000	1605000	Henry Ford, in his true wit that he had many years ago,
1605000	1609000	he was confronted with stockholders and news reporters and someone in the crowd said,
1609000	1612000	you know, Mr. Ford, I know you're going to mass produce these things,
1612000	1614000	but what are you going to do about the fuel?
1614000	1616000	Where are you going to get the fuel for all these things?
1616000	1618000	And he stopped for a second, he thought, and he said, you know,
1618000	1621000	I'm not going to worry about that.
1621000	1624000	We know that in fact that hydrogen is everywhere.
1624000	1629000	As long as we build cost-effective pieces of equipment that generate electricity,
1629000	1633000	then we're going to look to those other companies that create and develop hydrogen
1633000	1635000	to be able to supply us.
1643000	1646000	Cisco as an acronym stands for System and Services Company.
1646000	1649000	We deal primarily with restaurants, schools, hospitals,
1649000	1652000	anybody that's in the food service business.
1652000	1657000	We use triple pallet jacks to move the groceries from our warehouse to the docks
1657000	1659000	and they're powered traditionally by lead core batteries.
1659000	1664000	The fuel cell that we use here in Grand Rapids was provided for us by Plug Power
1664000	1668000	and they are used in place of batteries and the fuel cell itself
1668000	1673000	provides a consistent level of power during its entire use of its fuel,
1673000	1677000	which is different from our traditional batteries, which have a declining performance.
1677000	1681000	As soon as you start using that battery, the power starts to decline
1681000	1686000	and therefore the performance of the piece of equipment declines with the decreasing power.
1686000	1689000	The traditional battery lasts anywhere from six to eight hours,
1689000	1693000	depending on how new that battery is, as compared to a fuel cell
1693000	1696000	which may last up to 14 hours per shift.
1696000	1699000	Huge savings for us because we're not changing batteries,
1699000	1703000	we're not recharging batteries so we have utility savings as well,
1703000	1708000	but also our selectors stay busy selecting groceries instead of swapping batteries out.
1708000	1710000	They're a very smooth operating source of power.
1710000	1713000	We've had good results from a handling standpoint.
1713000	1718000	The units themselves weigh 600 pounds less than our previous batteries
1718000	1722000	and if you take the 600 pounds off, replace it with a new power cell,
1722000	1726000	the handle which the selector operates becomes much easier to move around
1726000	1728000	and that's been an added benefit.
1728000	1732000	The employees that operate the triple pallet jacks have been positive
1732000	1736000	in their feedback about how they operate, how smooth they operate
1736000	1739000	and so far we've had no negative feedback from them,
1739000	1742000	which is probably the most important vote of confidence.
1742000	1748000	The people that actually use this day in, day out as part of their tools to do their job
1748000	1751000	are enjoying the experience.
1751000	1757000	The operators of these triple pallet jacks are responsible to fuel their unit when necessary.
1757000	1761000	It operates much like a carb does in terms of a fuel gauge.
1761000	1763000	When it does indicate it needs to be refueled,
1763000	1767000	the selector comes to the fuel station and goes through a very quick process,
1767000	1773000	usually less than a minute to refuel his or her particular triple pallet jack.
1773000	1778000	There are warehouses using this technology to various degrees already.
1778000	1781000	We're on the front end of this change.
1781000	1787000	I'd like to think in the future this entire facility will be powered by an alternative fuel source
1787000	1792000	and if Hydrogen's the answer, we're certainly one step forward in the right direction.
1798000	1801000	Our customers are asking for better solutions.
1801000	1807000	They want to be quieter, they want to be lighter, they want to be smarter machines.
1809000	1815000	Many of our products that are used for golf environments are in a situation where
1815000	1817000	they're used very early in the morning.
1817000	1822000	A lot of golf courses are being built around houses and they want quiet equipment.
1822000	1828000	Fuel cells are a solution for this.
1828000	1833000	We don't want to have to sacrifice performance in order to get the benefits of electric power.
1833000	1838000	So first of all, one of our guiding principles is that the machines will be able to do the same tasks
1838000	1842000	that you're used to and feel and operate much the same way.
1842000	1845000	Given that assumption, there are some differences.
1845000	1851000	The components are different sized and different weights, so you have to repackage them in new areas.
1851000	1855000	They have to be weather protected and environmental protected.
1855000	1857000	They're basically off-road equipment.
1859000	1863000	The fuel cells that we are using are called a PEM fuel cell.
1863000	1868000	PEM stands for Proton Exchange Membrane and it's one of several types of fuel cells,
1868000	1874000	particularly suitable for mobile applications because they're compact, lightweight,
1874000	1878000	they start up fast and they follow loads very quickly.
1878000	1882000	We've chosen to use compressed hydrogen as a fuel storage onboard.
1882000	1889000	In order to get enough volume of hydrogen, we are operating at 5,000 psi tanks.
1889000	1893000	Keep the tanks lightweight instead of a thick heavy-walled steel tank.
1893000	1895000	We've got a composite tank.
1895000	1901000	They're a bladder, either aluminum or some kind of plastic wrapped with threads to make the tank strong enough.
1901000	1907000	We're able to get lightweight power and we can refuel quickly with the hydrogen
1907000	1912000	and batteries that are heavy and they take a lot of time to recharge.
1915000	1918000	Hydrogen in a fuel cell is clean.
1918000	1921000	It is completely green and you give off water.
1921000	1926000	There's a lot fewer moving parts than in an engine, a lot less friction.
1926000	1932000	As the industry evolves, there's no reason it shouldn't be able to get long life as one of its better attributes.
1932000	1935000	In my opinion, hydrogen is safe when used properly.
1935000	1939000	Systems have to be designed so that they're safe, people have to be trained.
1939000	1942000	Then it's just like handling any of these other high-energy contents.
1942000	1949000	One of the key advantages that our industry has is that we are a fleet operation.
1949000	1955000	Turf equipment on a golf course or a park system or something comes home the roost in the same building every night
1955000	1957000	and then is deployed during the day and comes back.
1957000	1964000	The ability to put in one central refueling site to take care of a bunch of product is inherent to our business.
1964000	1970000	It lets us become, I think, a niche market that can start to use fuel cells quicker than many other places.
1977000	1979000	We got started in 1980.
1979000	1982000	We brewed our first batch of beer at a smaller facility.
1982000	1985000	I was a home brewer who turned commercial brewer.
1985000	1989000	We've got 450 employees, seventh or eighth largest breweries in the country.
1989000	1992000	Distribution in every state.
1992000	2000000	I wanted to be more energy independent and so we started looking at ways to both conserve energy and be more energy efficient.
2000000	2006000	Actually, going back to when we first started, I put in things like ice banks to store energy at night.
2006000	2009000	So we've been embracing some of those concepts for a long time.
2009000	2016000	We've done a lot of optimization and put in current technology and some of those projects have two or three year payback.
2016000	2021000	So it's not all done strictly for environmental benefit, but it's nice to get both.
2021000	2026000	Some of the projects don't have great returns and so you really couldn't justify them strictly on a return on investment basis.
2026000	2030000	And we do a lot of what we do because we think it's the right thing.
2030000	2040000	And as a manufacturer, being in an industry that does utilize a lot of resources, we see it as one of our obligations to do our business in a sound manner
2040000	2045000	and look for ways to minimize inputs and to minimize waste streams.
2046000	2052000	As a manufacturer, power needs are 24-7 because we have refrigeration and pumps and things that are operating.
2052000	2060000	It was both from energy efficiency and from air emissions, I guess, that I really wanted to give the fuel cell a try.
2060000	2066000	We've got four 250 kilowatt units that are considered a direct fuel cell, so they don't need a separate source of hydrogen.
2066000	2071000	They have an internal process that reforms the hydrogen out of the feed gas.
2071000	2077000	So we feed it either biogas or natural gas and the process is part of the fuel cell stack.
2077000	2081000	And so as the gas goes in, hydrogen gets separated and then that's fed into the fuel cell.
2081000	2083000	We also have heat recovery boilers.
2083000	2090000	We capture about a million and a quarter BTUs of energy back as steam and that goes back into our brewing process.
2090000	2097000	The fuel cell is, I think, at the top as far as overall conversion of that input energy to output electricity.
2097000	2102000	Having the distributed power generation, you're not losing power through transmission line loss.
2102000	2106000	If you can co-generate and use the heat and the electricity, you've picked up even more.
2106000	2112000	So I think our overall efficiency is approaching 70% for our input energy with the heat recovery,
2112000	2118000	which would be close to double, I think, what the average fossil fuel plant would be putting out.
2118000	2124000	As far as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide and other things that are normal combustion byproducts,
2124000	2126000	none of those that are emitted from the fuel cell.
2126000	2132000	All of our fermenters are tied into pipes where we can collect the carbon dioxide that's naturally produced from fermentation.
2132000	2137000	And that's compressed and cleaned up and stored and allows us to have our own source of CO2 here.
2137000	2140000	Normally, breweries would purchase that if they don't recover it.
2140000	2146000	And so now that we've recovered ours, we have our own source of naturally produced carbon dioxide that's been captured
2146000	2149000	rather than emitted naturally produced carbon dioxide.
2149000	2153000	It's used in the bottling process and moving beer around and dispensing beer.
2153000	2155000	So we've just completed a pretty big solar array.
2155000	2157000	I think we'll have one of the largest in the country.
2157000	2162000	So that's pretty exciting and we're using sort of new inverter technology that's very efficient.
2162000	2165000	So we're doing a good job converting sun's energy into electricity.
2165000	2167000	Middle part of the day, we're drawing more power.
2167000	2173000	So when our solar panels are putting out their maximum is when our power consumption is at its maximum as well.
2173000	2177000	When the solar's not working, we have our fuel cells giving us our base load.
2177000	2179000	So it's a good combination for us.
2179000	2181000	We actually have our own herd of cattle.
2181000	2188000	We feed our spent grain to the cattle and the manure from that is composted and put back on our hops field.
2188000	2191000	So we have a fairly closed loop on our hops here on site.
2191000	2194000	We do treat all of our own wastewater.
2194000	2200000	So we take all of our waste streams, our liquid waste from the brewing process, spilled beer, yeast, bits of hops and malt.
2200000	2207000	And that's fed into a digester which produces between 35 to 70 cubic feet a minute of methane.
2207000	2210000	And then that methane is fed to the fuel cells.
2210000	2213000	We use a mix of biogas and natural gas.
2213000	2216000	Since it's more efficient, it'll be cheaper to produce power this way.
2216000	2222000	Up to close to 80% of our own electrical power needs generated here on site.
2222000	2231000	Our goal will be to get to 100% power generation and through both conservation efforts and some additional power generation, I think we can get there.
2231000	2233000	I think it works for a lot of other industries.
2233000	2235000	We get a lot of visitors here.
2235000	2240000	I know there's quite a few hotels in one group that's put in fuel cells.
2240000	2242000	One of the local casinos has put them in.
2242000	2248000	So if you have a need for both heat and electricity on a continuous basis, you can justify this kind of technology.
2254000	2259000	The California Fuel Cell Partnership is a collaboration amongst industry and government.
2259000	2268000	We have members from the automotive industry, energy companies, fuel cell technology companies, as well as government from state, local and federal levels.
2268000	2273000	We're working together to promote the commercialization of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles.
2275000	2284000	Many years ago when we were dealing with trying to reduce smog in the face of our continued population and vehicle growth here in California,
2284000	2289000	we looked and said we really need to have zero emission vehicles or something that's very, very close.
2289000	2291000	And there were two technologies available.
2291000	2294000	One was battery electric vehicles.
2294000	2296000	The other technology was fuel cell vehicles.
2296000	2300000	With this particular vehicle, it actually has a hydrogen fuel cell system in it.
2300000	2303000	And what that system is, we have high pressure hydrogen stored in the vehicle.
2303000	2308000	This fuel cell itself actually converts this electrochemically to electricity, which drives the vehicle.
2308000	2311000	What I tend to get comments about is the sound or lack of it.
2311000	2315000	In this particular vehicle, this platform, we have a compressor, which makes a little bit of noise.
2315000	2318000	But overall, it's about as quiet as it can be.
2320000	2324000	When we first started this program, you know, we had a lot of vehicle issues and stuff like that.
2324000	2328000	I have to say that we've definitely turned that around to where these vehicles are very reliable.
2328000	2331000	We have them out in a fleet over the whole country.
2331000	2338000	And we're very impressed with the way they perform and handle and their reliability.
2339000	2343000	Oftentimes, I get comments about how stable it feels, how it doesn't feel like a prototype.
2343000	2346000	It feels very much like a car that you could just go out and buy.
2346000	2349000	And obviously, the next question I get is, why can't I get it now?
2349000	2353000	The most common comment I see is that the vehicle is really cool.
2353000	2356000	When you get in the vehicle and you drive around in general,
2356000	2360000	there's not much of a difference between that vehicle and a conventional vehicle.
2360000	2365000	It drives about the same, better pickup in the city, better acceleration, a little quieter.
2365000	2368000	But when they know that it's boarding hydrogen and has a fuel cell,
2368000	2373000	it has this cool green feel to it, and that's what people respond to.
2374000	2378000	We have real-world customers, so we'll have real-world feedback.
2378000	2383000	The customer can cope with infrastructure, with the vehicle durability, with the range issues.
2383000	2387000	The customer compares the vehicle just to a normal, standard car.
2387000	2393000	That's why we have custom operation because it's not only important to have technology advancement,
2393000	2396000	but also to listen closely to what the customer says,
2396000	2401000	because at the end of the day, if the customer does not buy your nice piece of technical equipment,
2401000	2403000	the whole technology is a failure.
2408000	2413000	With a battery-electric vehicle, you have to make the electricity somehow to recharge the batteries.
2413000	2416000	With this vehicle, you have to make the hydrogen somehow.
2417000	2420000	The hydrogen tanks are right under the rear seats.
2420000	2424000	The fuel cell system is located under the front seats, the driver and passenger seats.
2426000	2431000	The electric motor is up front, and then in the back, under the cargo compartment, there's a battery.
2431000	2435000	And the battery works with the fuel cell to provide electricity to the electric motor.
2435000	2439000	The battery does the same thing that it does in a hybrid car, which is called regenerative braking.
2439000	2444000	And what happens is when we're slowing down, the energy that otherwise would have just been wasted through the brakes
2444000	2449000	is actually captured in the battery, and then when you need power to accelerate or go up a hill,
2449000	2453000	both the battery and the fuel cell can put electric power to the electric motors.
2455000	2458000	This vehicle is equipped with leak detectors that will immediately tell you if there's a leak,
2458000	2461000	so you know to pull over, get the vehicle towed to a place that could be repaired.
2461000	2466000	Hydrogen is very, very light, so if there is a leak, it tends to disperse very rapidly.
2466000	2472000	The hydrogen storage tanks in these vehicles are incredibly well-designed, very strong, fiber-wrapped cylinders.
2472000	2476000	They've done extensive testing with them to ensure that they're as safe as possible.
2476000	2482000	It has a neat safety feature where there's some little side pillars in the rear of the vehicle, you can see.
2482000	2486000	And there's tubes running up from the hydrogen tanks through those side pillars up to a pressure release valve,
2486000	2488000	which is a little bump you see on the roof of the car.
2488000	2491000	So if there's an accident, the system will detect a loss of pressure,
2491000	2495000	and the hydrogen will be immediately vented through the pressure release valve on the roof.
2495000	2499000	You can measure hydrogen in terms of volume. You can talk about gallons or liters of hydrogen.
2499000	2503000	But because the volume changes at different pressures, we tend to think of it in terms of weight.
2503000	2507000	A certain amount of hydrogen is going to weigh the same regardless of what pressure it's at.
2507000	2511000	One kilogram of hydrogen stores as much energy as one gallon of gasoline.
2511000	2514000	This vehicle stores about two kilograms of hydrogen.
2514000	2520000	Because it's under high pressure, that pump, when I clamped the nozzle onto the gas tank, it has to form a very tight seal.
2520000	2524000	And unless the pump knows that there's a very tight seal, the pump won't even turn on.
2524000	2527000	So it's got a lot of safety built into it.
2527000	2531000	Right now, we're at a very interesting stage of development of this technology.
2531000	2536000	In some ways, fuel cells are an easier fit for buses than they are for cars.
2536000	2539000	You don't get much cleaner than a fuel cell bus, that's for sure.
2539000	2541000	It's a zero-emission vehicle.
2541000	2547000	We're the first to actually build a fleet of fuel cell buses for an actual heavy-duty transit application.
2547000	2552000	New Flyer Industries is the largest manufacturer in North America of heavy-duty transit vehicles.
2552000	2560000	Currently have about 17,000 buses on the road at almost 250 different transit agencies.
2560000	2570000	Because of the fact that we had the Vancouver Winter Olympics, there was a drive to showcase and demonstrate green technology.
2570000	2576000	When the contract was originally tendered to do the fuel cell buses for the Olympics,
2576000	2582000	we proceeded to develop an initial prototype, which would eventually serve as the mold for our production.
2582000	2589000	One of the big challenges with developing a fuel cell bus is to make sure that it can operate in the cold temperature environment.
2589000	2598000	Once we were satisfied with that, then we proceeded with the production to build the 20 buses for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics.
2598000	2605000	In most ways, the vehicle went through our standard production line, our standard production stations.
2605000	2609000	The only difference was that there were a few extra steps at certain points in the line,
2609000	2613000	where we had to install the fuel tanks and some of the other hybrid components,
2613000	2618000	but we were able to incorporate that all within our existing processes and equipment.
2618000	2627000	Because we're a low-floor design, which all our buses are nowadays for wheelchair accessibility and ease of getting on and off for passengers,
2627000	2631000	one of the challenges with that is that the bus is very low to the ground,
2631000	2634000	so there's no room under the bus to really install much equipment.
2634000	2643000	With the large number of components that are required for the fuel cell bus in terms of the hydrogen tanks, the batteries, the cooling systems,
2643000	2649000	all that takes up a lot of space. We ended up putting quite a few of the components on the roof of the vehicle,
2649000	2651000	as well as in the rear engine compartment.
2651000	2659000	From a static standpoint, you would actually have a lot of trouble just from a quick glance telling a fuel cell bus apart from a regular bus.
2659000	2663000	If you were to walk on and sit in a seat, you wouldn't notice much out of the ordinary
2663000	2666000	and the stuff you don't see, which makes the technology interesting.
2666000	2670000	The big challenge is operating a hydrogen fuel cell coach in cold weather.
2670000	2674000	The primary byproduct of the chemical reaction is water.
2674000	2679000	Of course, we run into the issue of what happens when you drop below zero degrees Celsius.
2679000	2683000	If you don't design for that, you can certainly run the risk of freezing that water,
2683000	2686000	which can definitely damage portions of your fuel cell.
2686000	2694000	One of the initial things we had to work on was a way to plug in the vehicles overnight to ensure that the fuel cell didn't freeze.
2694000	2699000	The other big challenge is how do you ensure that on those cold days that you have enough heat available
2699000	2703000	so that you can properly start the bus and then once the bus is running,
2703000	2708000	how do you ensure that you have enough heat available so that everybody is comfortable within the vehicle.
2708000	2715000	One of the aspects about the fuel cell bus design is that it uses electric motors to drive the wheels.
2715000	2719000	The fuel cell itself does not actually directly drive the vehicle.
2719000	2722000	All it does is convert hydrogen to electricity.
2722000	2727000	So that electricity is used to drive motors and other systems on the vehicle.
2727000	2733000	One of the advantages of an electric motor is that at very low speeds they generate a high amount of torque.
2733000	2735000	The acceleration is very good.
2735000	2740000	The other big advantage is the braking because we have an electric system on the bus
2740000	2743000	with very powerful storage batteries and generators.
2743000	2749000	We're able to regain energy from the braking system when the vehicle stops.
2749000	2754000	And not only does that increase the life of your brake pads and allow you to charge up your electrical system,
2754000	2757000	but it also gives you a lot of stopping power.
2759000	2765000	Hydrogen buses are designed to work very similar to the way the diesel bus is as far as duty cycle,
2765000	2769000	and they're able to perform all the same functions as a standard diesel bus.
2769000	2774000	Our buses have a range of about 300 to 325 miles.
2774000	2777000	Diesel buses, and again this fuel cell bus,
2777000	2781000	dependent on a route service, it can be out from anywhere from a trip or run,
2781000	2786000	which is just a few hours up to 16, 17, even 18 hours without any trouble.
2786000	2794000	These buses, because of extra infrastructure on the roof for gas, storage, for all the additional components,
2794000	2799000	they're over 8,000 pounds heavier than the comparable diesel bus.
2799000	2806000	But in spite of that, we're seeing as much as 100% or double the fuel economy over a diesel bus.
2806000	2814000	The main thing everybody notices is how quiet and smooth that the vehicle is in comparison to a standard diesel bus.
2814000	2819000	There's no transmission on it, so it's very smooth, powers away very quietly.
2819000	2824000	We have had some comments from riders that the bus is actually too quiet.
2824000	2826000	You can actually sneak up on them.
2826000	2830000	They've been surprised when it pulls up to the curb, and they didn't even realize it was there.
2831000	2838000	With the fuel cell technology, this bus doesn't care where the hydrogen comes from,
2838000	2846000	and the value of hydrogen in transportation applications is that we can make hydrogen from solar and wind and biomass.
2846000	2849000	Here we're using natural gas.
2849000	2854000	While it's not completely zero emission, it has some CO2 emissions.
2854000	2859000	Well to wheel, it's still better than our regular diesel internal combustion engine vehicles.
2859000	2863000	They're basically a large golf cart, and there's not a lot of maintenance on a golf cart.
2863000	2870000	One of the largest maintenance items for any bus is the brakes, and with these vehicles having regenerative braking,
2870000	2875000	we're hoping to realize better brake life than the cost savings associated with that.
2875000	2877000	We're learning from these buses.
2877000	2879000	We're learning from other examples throughout the world.
2879000	2886000	All the supercomputers of the world, all the brilliant minds that delivered the technology in the first place,
2886000	2895000	can't think of every variable, and what we do here is we capture almost all the variables that they can't think of.
2895000	2904000	And we're all learning from this, not just us as users, but the technology providers are seeing things that they couldn't replicate in the labs.
2904000	2911000	We're very much committed to looking at alternative fuels to improve our environmental footprint.
2911000	2916000	Zero emission from the tailpipe, virtually no noise from the engine,
2916000	2925000	and the potential of addressing global warming, climate change issues, sustainable energy supplies to fuel our vehicles,
2925000	2927000	to help us reach energy independence.
2927000	2938000	Our end state goal is commercialization so that all of the transit buses in the United States we would like to see as zero emission fuel cell buses.
2939000	2944000	Hydrogen has been used safely throughout our economy.
2944000	2951000	We use most of the hydrogen today to make cleaner gasoline, but it's also used in food manufacturing and consumer products.
2951000	2957000	If you look at hydrogen compared to gasoline, certainly both fuels have a lot of energy content.
2957000	2962000	You must pay attention to safety considerations when using the fuel.
2962000	2966000	Hydrogen is no less safe than gasoline, it's just different.
2966000	2973000	If there is a hydrogen leak, it's very light and so it will go up and rise immediately and dissipate into the atmosphere.
2973000	2980000	It's totally non-toxic, it won't cause health problems or environmental problems if it is released into the atmosphere.
2980000	2984000	All vehicle fuels can be dangerous.
2984000	2987000	If they weren't, they wouldn't be useful as fuel.
2988000	2995000	The trick for any fuel is to engineer it so that it is as safe as currently available technologies.
2995000	2998000	Today that's gasoline in conventional vehicles.
2998000	3007000	And most people I know working with hydrogen believe that hydrogen is either as safe or safer than gasoline is today.
3007000	3009000	It is safer than gasoline.
3009000	3017000	Most people say today that if you were to have a gasoline engine today and you were trying to bring it on the market for the very first time,
3017000	3022000	there would be no way that you would be able to put that gasoline engine onto the marketplace.
3022000	3023000	It just wouldn't happen.
3023000	3034000	I quite sincerely believe and I've seen test evidence that supports my conclusion that the gas tank in the suburban that I drive is more dangerous than a hydrogen fuel tank.
3034000	3039000	We have conducted 120,000 fuelings worldwide already.
3039000	3047000	We know hydrogen can be delivered, compressed and dispensed into vehicles very safely, as safely if not more safely than traditional fuels.
3047000	3051000	We've done extensive safety training with our maintenance and service personnel.
3051000	3060000	We've worked with some very good partners that have designed some very good systems, our fueling station, our facility upgrades,
3060000	3069000	all incorporate hydrogen sensors and fire sensors and very robust systems to track that.
3069000	3071000	Safety was a big part of it.
3071000	3079000	I wanted to make sure that the testing that they had done was adequate for our employees' benefit as well as for the community.
3079000	3085000	I am good fortune to drive a fuel cell car on a regular basis and I use it to take my kids to school,
3085000	3089000	go to the baseball practice, go grocery shopping, come to work.
3089000	3093000	When they fuel the car, there's no fumes or drips of gasoline.
3093000	3096000	I'd much rather drive my fuel cell vehicle than my gasoline vehicle.
3100000	3103000	Icelandic New Energy was founded in 1999.
3103000	3105000	It's a joint venture company.
3105000	3113000	It's owned 51% by Icelandic shareholders, which groups together the energy companies, the government, the academia like the university,
3113000	3116000	the innovation center, investment funds and private investors.
3116000	3122000	All the key players in Iceland to have anything to do with hydrogen are joined into one company.
3122000	3128000	Then we have Daimler, Shell Hydrogen and Statoil Hydro from Norway, which are the other three investors.
3128000	3138000	The goal of the company is to be kind of an enabler to evaluate the possibility of creating the first hydrogen society in the world here in Iceland.
3138000	3145000	They foresaw Iceland as a perfect test ground because they knew that all the energy sources to produce the hydrogen would be or renewable,
3145000	3147000	coming from hydro or geothermal.
3147000	3150000	This ship is of course mainly a touristic boat, whale watching.
3150000	3156000	On the ship you have 150 people traveling for three or four hours at the consecutive time.
3156000	3159000	We put a fuel cell engine on a commercial boat.
3159000	3161000	This is actually the fuel cell unit.
3161000	3165000	The hydrogen storage is actually back in the engine room.
3165000	3169000	So you have hydrogen pipelines coming in connected to the fuel cell unit.
3169000	3171000	And then we actually have a hybrid system.
3171000	3177000	So we are also having a little bit of battery packs to have enough power for all the auxiliaries in the boat.
3177000	3182000	There have been some technical hiccups on the way, but that's one of the reasons why you do projects like this,
3182000	3188000	to learn how and which problems we're faced with taking hydrogen out to sea.
3188000	3194000	There is now a project in Germany to build a ship powered solely by hydrogen.
3194000	3196000	And they designed the ship around the hydrogen.
3196000	3200000	What we did here is we basically put hydrogen on board an existing ship.
3200000	3202000	And there are some complications with that.
3202000	3209000	The main issue is how to get certification and how to fulfill all the strict regulation on having hydrogen on a ship.
3209000	3217000	I think those have been the most important learning steps and teaches us a lot about how to do next steps
3217000	3221000	regarding using hydrogen as part of a marine fuel.
3221000	3226000	Usually when they go out for whale watching, when you see whales, they actually want to shut down the engine
3226000	3229000	to get rid of the noise and get rid of the vibration of the ship.
3229000	3234000	Before they had to run at least the auxiliary engine on diesel, so you still have some noise and some vibration.
3234000	3238000	So what they do now is when they find whales, they actually can shut down the whole system.
3238000	3240000	The only operation is the fuel cell.
3240000	3244000	And that means no vibration, no noise and no emissions.
3244000	3250000	And that's actually pretty cool when you're sitting in the middle of the Atlantic with absolutely no movement whatsoever.
3250000	3252000	And you can see the whales peacefully.
3255000	3261000	I think people are very positive towards using the domestic energy sources to power everything we actually can.
3261000	3264000	We are quite confident about the hydrogen infrastructure.
3264000	3268000	We don't think that will be a hindrance or a barrier to a hydrogen society.
3268000	3275000	People are very keen on what can we do and they're realizing that the things we can actually do will also be clean.
3275000	3277000	So that's a very big added benefit.
3277000	3282000	You also have to think about how much CO2 savings are in using hydrogen.
3282000	3287000	It's all about the environment and if we can also power the ship partly by hydrogen,
3287000	3292000	which is in at least Iceland, the totally clean energy chain, that's of course a beautiful picture.
3295000	3301000	From power plants to wind turbines, city buses to lawn equipment, breweries to warehouses,
3301000	3306000	hydrogen and fuel cells are quietly improving our ability to deliver clean,
3306000	3312000	economical energy in our homes or cars and where we work.
3312000	3318000	As the world thirst for energy continues to grow and environmental costs mount,
3318000	3323000	hydrogen provides us with the choice to create our own clean energy future.
