00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Hydrogen is the most abundant element on Earth. It really is nature's fuel.

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
We're at a very interesting stage of development of this technology where it's not quite ready for prime time, but it's getting tantalizingly close.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Fuel cell technology is evolving, the technology is improving constantly.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.000
We're competing in a market that we have to compete with batteries and generators, and how do we do this?

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
I think hydrogen has great potential to become one of our primary fuels for the transportation industry in the future.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
I would much rather drive my fuel cell vehicle than my gasoline vehicle.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Funding provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory,

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
the Energy and Environmental Research Center's National Center for Hydrogen Technology, and the members of Prairie Public.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
You've probably heard something about hydrogen. You may know hydrogen can be used to fuel cars,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
but did you know that hydrogen is used safely all around you every day?

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
In data centers, warehouses, golf courses, and even breweries. Hydrogen is nature's fuel.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
It can be made where you want, when you want.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
Imagine living in a world without concerns about energy security or pollution,

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
where you can get all the energy you need from domestic sources.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
Imagine the world of fuel cells using safe, clean, abundant hydrogen.

01:34.000 --> 01:48.000
This is actually an electric car. It's got an electric motor in the front that drives the car forward,

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
and it gets most of its electricity from a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen from the air into electricity and water as a waste product.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
The concept of the fuel cell has been around 150 years as a sort of chemical principle.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Starting about the 60s, these devices were made for space, and over about the last 15 years, automakers have been working very hard

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
to develop the technology for automobiles as a way of simultaneously reducing the use of oil, reducing air pollution,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
and also reducing the release of greenhouse gases.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
This type of fuel cell is called a PEM fuel cell, proton exchange membrane.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
What I like to explain it is sort of like a sandwich, where in the middle of the sandwich, the meat of the sandwich, if you will,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
you have a membrane material. You have hydrogen on one side, and you have platinum as a catalyst material.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
That catalyst allows the hydrogen molecule to split apart into protons and electrons.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
The protons go through the membrane, the electrons have to go around the membrane,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
and as those electrons are going around the membrane, they're powering the electric motor.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Everything meets on the side with the oxygen and forms water as the waste product.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Sometimes you'll hear it called a fuel cell stack, because it's a whole stack of these fuel cells,

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
just like you stack batteries together in a flashlight to build up more voltage.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
A car like this, you might have 400 fuel cells all stacked together to give you a few hundred volts.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.000
Currently, we produce in the world over 50 million tons of hydrogen, with about a fifth of that being consumed in the United States.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
That hydrogen is being used primarily as a feedstock for making agricultural products such as fertilizer,

03:23.000 --> 03:32.000
and also a chemical feedstock to take the petroleum in its raw form and make it into the petroleum that we use in either diesel or gasoline.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
It's also used for medical applications, food processing, a variety of smaller type uses.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
If you look down the road in the hydrogen economy, some of those uses are for transportation,

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
such as forklifts in a warehouse, or even putting electricity onto the grid.

03:50.000 --> 03:59.000
As always, when you start going into new markets, it becomes difficult for commercial companies to invest in something that's years out.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
That's why we have programs like the National Center for Hydrogen Technology, where you have some government support,

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
because that federal support helps bridge that gap.

04:09.000 --> 04:18.000
With that, we work closely with commercial partners, and we find opportunities to provide developments in terms of being more effective,

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
lower cost, better environmental advantages, and these are all things that are helping to buoy the hydrogen economy.

04:26.000 --> 04:34.000
As we go down this path and we get those goals met, we start grabbing more and more market opportunities.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
It becomes a matter of greatly reducing the cost of producing the hydrogen as well, the fuel cells, and also the end uses.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
And we then reach more and more applications, and we see it accelerating.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
And as that happens, you get the benefit of more public buy-in.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
The more they're familiar with technology, the more they want it, and the more they're interested.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
We see some very significant technological evolution taking place, which says that hydrogen can be exceptionally competitive,

05:04.000 --> 05:10.000
and we firmly believe that the ultimate energy source in this world is going to be hydrogen.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Hydrogen is interesting. It can be made a lot of different ways.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There's a lot of domestic resources that can be used to make hydrogen.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
Any source of electricity can be used to make hydrogen from water.

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
Hydrogen can also be made through a lot of biomass pathways, and right now it's made a lot from natural gas, which is not ultimately sustainable,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
but it's sort of a bridge technology to potentially getting to cleaner sources of hydrogen in the future.

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
To get hydrogen from water, we can use electricity to break the chemical bonds between oxygen and hydrogen.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
This process is called electrolysis.

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
Hydrogenics is a global leader in the development of fuel cells and on-site hydrogen generation.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
We can provide the hydrogen stations that produce the hydrogen.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
The process starts with the electrolyzer. That's where we make the hydrogen.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
We take city water and we purify it and put that inside our electrolyzers.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
From then, the water is electrolyzed. We produce hydrogen and oxygen.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Oxygen is vented and hydrogen is captured.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
It is then purified through our dryer and purifier.

06:19.000 --> 06:30.000
The purifier removes any trace oxygen inside hydrogen stream and the dryer removes any moisture that was left over from the electrolysis process.

06:30.000 --> 06:38.000
The gas comes out at about 150 psi from then on it's compressed to 6000 psi where it's stored into storage tanks.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
From the storage tanks, the gas is diverted into the dispenser.

06:45.000 --> 06:53.000
Most of the hydrogen we have today comes from natural gas through a process called steam methane reforming.

06:53.000 --> 06:59.000
I would say about 90% of the world's hydrogen comes from fossil fuels from reforming natural gas.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
For that, you need the capital cost of millions of dollars to create your plant and you produce thousands of kilograms in one day.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
We can get hydrogen from coal through gasification.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
We've been using coal in this country for many, many years and primarily it's been combusted.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
We burn the coal and we essentially convert it entirely to heat.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
In a gasification system, we convert coal to something very similar to natural gas.

07:27.000 --> 07:37.000
Then that natural gas has an extremely high hydrogen content and we can then take that and either manipulate it to pure hydrogen or we can even produce liquid fuels from it.

07:37.000 --> 07:45.000
Gasification has the promise of being one of the few sources that we can use to produce very, very large quantities of hydrogen.

07:45.000 --> 07:52.000
So as we transition to a hydrogen economy, coal is one of those domestic resources that can really step in.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
We believe very strongly that coal must remain a part of our energy future.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
In order to do that, we have to find the technologies to utilize it more efficiently and effectively.

08:00.000 --> 08:13.000
We're convinced that because of our experience and knowledge that we've gained from our decoder gasification project that we have a way in which to find a solution to this very challenging issue for our continued ability to utilize coal.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Hydrogen today is something we look to for the future.

08:17.000 --> 08:27.000
If you want to talk about renewables, you've got to find a way in which to store the energy because electrical energy has to be used at the time it's produced.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
And with renewables, you don't have that opportunity because when the wind is blowing, you may not have the load.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And so if you're producing it, how do we store it?

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
The hydrogen concept is one of those opportunities.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
A hydrogen generation can happen through a number of different routes.

08:52.000 --> 09:01.000
The easiest route would have us making electricity and then using that electricity to run an electrolyzer which would split water electrochemically.

09:01.000 --> 09:10.000
We can also drive chemical processes which could then be used to produce fuels such as hydrogen or even liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
Solar typically only works when the sun is up. Wind only works when the wind is blowing.

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
When the sun goes down, then you have to make up all that solar power with other sources.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Or if the wind is blowing and suddenly it stops, it causes instabilities.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I need that power whenever there's a demand.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
The ability to store power is key to large-scale deployment because it removes that instability.

09:35.000 --> 09:44.000
In the same way hydrogen stores the energy from the sun and wind, we can use hydrogen to store the energy in moving water.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Although hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it's not readily available in a usable form.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
As a result, it has to be manufactured.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
The good news about hydrogen is it can be manufactured in a variety of ways and with a large array of feedstocks.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
Liquid hydrogen in general first came to the United States as part of the space program and it was large.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
Government support for that program helped subsidize the first plants.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Lindy is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Most of Lindy's hydrogen comes from this plant here in Magog, Quebec.

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
This plant utilizes a hydrogen waste stream that comes from a sodium chloride plant across the street.

10:22.000 --> 10:30.000
That plant takes a brine, electrolyzes it, makes sodium chloride and a 97% hydrogen waste stream.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
Lindy captures that hydrogen stream and uses hydroelectric power to purify it and liquefy it for delivery across the country.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
Essentially, the plant here uses electricity as the driving force to compress and liquefy the hydrogen.

10:47.000 --> 10:57.000
Our electricity, fortunately in Quebec, is essentially 97% comes from hydroelectricity, which is a renewable resource.

10:58.000 --> 11:07.000
For green hydrogen, I'd say it's hydrogen that's produced with zero or minimal greenhouse gas or other pollutants as byproducts.

11:07.000 --> 11:16.000
Other renewable ways of making hydrogen is to capture solar, wind, wave, geothermal power and electrolyze water to produce hydrogen.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
We produce hydrogen in a very environmentally friendly way because of the fact that we have hydroelectric power.

11:24.000 --> 11:32.000
However, we have to transport that hydrogen and the transportation does have an impact in terms of the carbon footprint.

11:32.000 --> 11:38.000
The reason we liquefy hydrogen is it's perhaps the most sufficient way to distribute hydrogen over long distances.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
And you can deliver the most hydrogen with the lowest carbon footprint as a liquid.

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
Currently, there's three traditional ways of storing hydrogen as largely dependent upon the volume of hydrogen you want to store

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
and how far you want to transport it.

11:54.000 --> 12:00.000
So if you need a couple of kilograms of hydrogen, typically steel cylinders is what you would use.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.000
When we get to a few hundred kilograms of hydrogen, we look to employ stainless steel tube trailers.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
When you get to larger, maybe several hundred to several thousand kilograms of hydrogen consumption,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
that's where liquid hydrogen becomes highly economical.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Beyond that is when you have to seriously start thinking about an on-site production.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
We know hydrogen can be delivered, compressed and dispensed into vehicles very safely,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
as safely if not more safely than traditional fuels.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Just as electricity is an energy carrier, so is hydrogen.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Hydrogen is an excellent way to transport energy in a usable form that can be fed to a fuel cell

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
and generate electricity where you need it, when you need it.

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
So whether you're moving your vehicles or you're lighting your house or heating your homes,

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
one of the beauties of hydrogen will be able to provide a common energy currency throughout the world.

12:50.000 --> 12:56.000
In a hydrogen economy, every area of the world will be able to generate this currency with the resources available to it.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
Hydrogen is produced today in large scales at economies that would make sense for hydrogen fueling.

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
So we're confident that industry can respond and that is largely with the infrastructure.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Fueling stations that are fueling tens or hundreds of cars instead of thousands of cars.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Obviously the infrastructure is very similar.

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
What you need to fuel one car is pretty much the same equipment you need to fuel a hundred cars or a thousand cars.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
When it comes to hydrogen refueling, there is quite a big difference.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
I'd rather fill out a hydrogen fueling station than a gasoline station,

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
due to the fact that gasoline stations have been developed from the 1940s and 50s.

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
Many of the standards and many of the safety standards have been grandfathered in.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
When we look at development of standards, we're looking at what is safe to fuel with the knowledge that we know today,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
not from what we knew earlier.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
With this knowledge, we're able to ensure that we design fully safe hydrogen stations.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Cross-global is primarily an alternate fuel dispenser manufacturer.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
So that would encase propane, natural gas, hydrogen, and very soon liquefied natural gas.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
We got quite a good head start in targeting from South America, Middle East, Europe, Asia,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
80% of our business would be outside of North America.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
At Cross, we're primarily an assembler and tester.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Mainly the components come into our factory, assembled into sub-assemblies,

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
and they move down the line to where they finally get put into the dispenser.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
You do some final wiring, tubing, moves on to the test bay.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Every unit is tested fully.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
And once it's approved, out the door to the end customer.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
When the public sees hydrogen at a station, they see the dispenser.

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
They don't often see the storage or the compression or any of the other equipment that's very vital,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
but it's hidden from the public's point of view.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
Hydrogen is about the vehicle that they're driving and the dispenser that they're filling it at.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
To compare a hydrogen dispenser to a gasoline dispenser, you can't pump a gas.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
You have to move it on a basis of pressure differential.

15:08.000 --> 15:17.000
So instead of a pump that draws fluid out, you have a valving that opens and closes to control the flow of gas to the vehicle.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
Instead of a turbine meter and a gasoline dispenser that spins to give you a reading on volume,

15:25.000 --> 15:30.000
you have a mass flow meter which senses the molecules of hydrogen flowing through it

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
and gives you that same mass reading on the display.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
One of the challenges with any new energy is distribution.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
In particular, the gasoline stations already exist.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
You're trying to compete with something that has been built up over 100 years.

15:47.000 --> 15:56.000
Initially, there will be hydrogen projects where buses return to a depot of fuel at night

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
or where you have the forklifts operating under one roof at a warehouse.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.000
The biggest barrier right now is probably the lack of vehicles.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Now, if you talk to an OEM vehicle manufacturer, they'll say the biggest barrier is the lack of stations.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I'd say we're both right. It's a chicken and egg challenge.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Do you bring out the vehicles first or do you bring the stations out first?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Well, you need both.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
You'll see reports that have suggested that it's going to cost up to a trillion dollars

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
to develop a new fueling infrastructure if we're going to deploy hydrogen in this country.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
The truth of the matter is that is totally wrong.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
The ERC has developed a technology called hydrogen on demand.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
And what it is is we can use a wide variety of feedstocks, which are readily available,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
to produce hydrogen as you're filling your vehicle.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
No more than you need to fill it, produces it on the spot in real time while you're filling the vehicle.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
It eliminates the cost of pressurizing the hydrogen, major cost out of the picture.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
Secondly, we eliminate the need for storage, another big cost out of the picture.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Third key thing, we can use just about every existing gas station in this country for this technology.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
And you can drive up to that station, you can buy gasoline, you can buy an ethanol blend, you can buy diesel, you can buy hydrogen.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
Our mission basically is to develop power systems that generate electricity

17:27.000 --> 17:38.000
because we firmly believe that electricity will be moving people around in the next wave of mobility for humankind.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
In product development, like all companies in a clean energy space,

17:44.000 --> 17:51.000
we're trying to deliver on the three promises, which are energy security, environmental quality, and economic opportunity.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
Novera got started by combining two emerging technologies.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
On one side, the hydrogen generation technology through reforming,

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
and the fuel cell stack technology, the electrochemical device that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electricity.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
PowerTap is our on-site hydrogen generation product,

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
which supplies on-site hydrogen to customers, forklifts, and fuel cell vehicles.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
The PowerTap on-site hydrogen generator is designed to operate off of natural gas.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
We do this because it's a readily available fuel.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
There's over 2 million miles of pipeline within the United States going to 69 million customers today.

18:37.000 --> 18:42.000
We're using the same natural gas that you are in your home running your boiler, running your hot water heater.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Nothing is different.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
This box, we like to call it actually a hydrogen generation appliance.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
We've taken large-scale industrial process and intensified it.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
We have natural gas and city water come in on the utility side.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It gets conditioned and then is sent to a steam methane reformer.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.000
It combines the steam as city water, combines the natural gas,

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
and it breaks the bonds into a hydrogen-rich stream, which in the industry we call syngas.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
After that fuel processing, it goes to a purification step where we get high-purity hydrogen,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
which is required for our fuel cell stacks.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Inside this canister is our steam methane reformer.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
It is taking the fuel and city water, it's converting the both into the syngas.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
We do sell these to both warehouses that are using forklift trucks,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
and also we're looking at opportunities to do merchant hydrogen,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
which is generating hydrogen for outright sale of the gas.

19:39.000 --> 19:46.000
The hydrogen refueling system that we have developed is based on the reformation of natural gas, reacting with water.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
There's a lot of critics of this approach because we're using a carbon-based fuel.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
While it's not totally carbon-free, it's an obvious choice as a part of the roadmap to carbon reduction.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
The stack on top you see is a commercially available stack that goes into our power-edge systems.

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
These are systems that are provided to the material handling market as battery replacements.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
What's intended for industrial heavy-duty industrial applications.

20:12.000 --> 20:19.000
The real advantage of fuel cells over other power plant type technologies is they are inherently scalable.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
So if I need a stack of just one kilowatt, there it is.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
If I need this stack to be 90 kilowatts, I simply add cells to it.

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
In terms of the prime power plant, the prime energy converter, it's real, it's today, we're doing it.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.000
They're ready, they're reliable, we're deploying them in fork trucks.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
The fork truck market is an ideal proving ground because it's a vehicle that's already electrified.

20:42.000 --> 20:49.000
It already uses batteries and we're proving that the fuel cell has value in displacing batteries in that application.

20:49.000 --> 20:57.000
This system is designed so that the user can push out the lead acid battery, put in our system and the truck doesn't know the difference.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.000
It's a hybrid system which has, instead of the gasoline-powered engine, we have a fuel cell engine,

21:03.000 --> 21:10.000
which actually is one of the nice points about fuel cells with the growth of hybrid technology in over-the-road vehicles.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
You can very easily see how you could take the internal combustion engine out and put a fuel cell in.

21:15.000 --> 21:22.000
In the traditional power supply system for electric forklifts, you have big racks and racks of lead acid batteries.

21:22.000 --> 21:29.000
For every truck you have up to three batteries and when the battery dies, you have to take it to a specialized machine

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
that pulls the battery out, puts it up on a rack to be charged and puts a new battery in.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
All this is very time intensive.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
A battery takes eight hours to charge and eight hours to cool.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
This system takes about two minutes to refuel.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
This is a fuel cell stack.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
This is what I call the dry end of the system because there's no water.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
This is the wet end.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
There's a condenser here for managing heat and water.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
So as a fuel cell runs, it creates water.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
This manages the water to keep it from getting too high or too low and also rejects the heat.

21:59.000 --> 22:06.000
Also in here we have the fuel handling components that take the very high pressure from the tank and step it down.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
There's an onboard computer which allows the fuel cell system to provide you with intelligent power.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
A lead acid battery is just a dumb battery.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
It can't tell you anything about how healthy it is or how productive the operator is

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
and what it will do is it will just slowly drain down in performance over the course of the shift

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
just like a flashlight that's going dim.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
What you find with these is you'll have consistent power.

22:27.000 --> 22:36.000
When you talk about family cars or SUVs, batteries will be too heavy and too bulky to be deployed and too expensive.

22:36.000 --> 22:44.000
To put a battery in a mini van today, you would have to add about 450 pounds.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
And that's carrying a gorilla inside your car.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
It's an invisible gorilla but nobody wants a gorilla in addition to the car you have.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
That's where the fuel cell will come in and will have the right substitute in that case.

23:07.000 --> 23:14.000
This is the world's first automated fuel cell assembly line.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
We can do a thousand cells a day.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Some of our stacks require about 50 cells.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
The reason for doing the line is, again, we're competing in a market that we have to compete with batteries and generators.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
And how do we do this?

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
One of the things that we found in order to compete in a world market is we can't have exotic materials.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
We figured out how we could design this in such a way that we could build it with robotics that are the same as the auto industry,

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
that are the same in the computer industry.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
Not exotics, not the super titanium, it's not the stuff that is just very, very costly high expenses.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
But we found low-cost materials that we could go ahead and put these together with.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
Everything that is readily available wherever we need to to become a global competitor.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
What we're building today, we're actually finding those marks that we can go into.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
The telecom industry, the data centers, those backup supports that we need that would replace the battery or the generator.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
So right away, we're going to go ahead and drive to those newer markets.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
This happens to be a 1,000-watt system that we've created.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
This is a 5,000-watt system.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
We have communications.

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
We can actually, from a remote distance, if the fuel gets to a certain level,

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
we can go ahead and have this unit call the fuel provider and have them go ahead and say,

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
hey, fuel's low, come and take care of it before the incident happens,

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
before you start running this unit and all of a sudden you find out that you're out of fuel.

24:40.000 --> 24:46.000
And this is just conventional batteries that you see quite often in data centers and telecom systems.

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
Just like any common generator, it takes, in some generators, it may take two, three minutes to come on.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
We can come on within about five seconds, three to five seconds.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Or an instant.

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
But in order not to lose that power, we bridge it with a small battery for a short period of time.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
I can demonstrate this.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
We turn on these really super bright lights here.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
And right now, the fuel cell is armed and it's watching the grid.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
And it's intelligent enough to see if the grid starts to drop.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
The fuel cell knows that it's time to come on.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
As soon as we shut off the power, the grid is there.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
The fuel cell's armed.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Fuel cell immediately knew to come on because it lost the power.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
It no longer has any power, but you didn't see any blinks in the light whatsoever.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Not one.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
There's all kinds of opportunities that are open to what the fuel cell has to offer.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
It's open for the imagination.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
This is a thousand watt system right here.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
It's a unit that we can use outdoors.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
This is the one that actually Governor Schwarzenegger used to light his Christmas tree every year.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
Normally a 60-foot Christmas tree that had at one time 5,000 watt light bulbs on it

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
and consumed about 25,000 watts of power.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
We were able to come back through, talk to them about that,

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
change their way of looking at it, put LED lights on this unit,

26:05.000 --> 26:11.000
ended up dropping the consumption from 25,000 watts down to 450 watts.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
And we were able to use it with a small little thousand watt fuel cell system that we have here.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
So every year he delights in the fact that he's running a Christmas tree

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
cost-effectively and showing that there's other alternatives to power.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
This is green and that's the great and wonderful thing about this is

26:29.000 --> 26:37.000
it's zero pollution, low noise, plus a tremendous amount of energy and a very small package.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
These are real.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
These are pieces of equipment we're going to see being used on a daily basis.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Henry Ford, in his true wit that he had many years ago,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
he was confronted with stockholders and news reporters and someone in the crowd said,

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
you know, Mr. Ford, I know you're going to mass produce these things,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
but what are you going to do about the fuel?

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Where are you going to get the fuel for all these things?

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
And he stopped for a second, he thought, and he said, you know,

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm not going to worry about that.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
We know that in fact that hydrogen is everywhere.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
As long as we build cost-effective pieces of equipment that generate electricity,

27:09.000 --> 27:13.000
then we're going to look to those other companies that create and develop hydrogen

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
to be able to supply us.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Cisco as an acronym stands for System and Services Company.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
We deal primarily with restaurants, schools, hospitals,

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
anybody that's in the food service business.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
We use triple pallet jacks to move the groceries from our warehouse to the docks

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
and they're powered traditionally by lead core batteries.

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
The fuel cell that we use here in Grand Rapids was provided for us by Plug Power

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
and they are used in place of batteries and the fuel cell itself

27:48.000 --> 27:53.000
provides a consistent level of power during its entire use of its fuel,

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
which is different from our traditional batteries, which have a declining performance.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
As soon as you start using that battery, the power starts to decline

28:01.000 --> 28:06.000
and therefore the performance of the piece of equipment declines with the decreasing power.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
The traditional battery lasts anywhere from six to eight hours,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
depending on how new that battery is, as compared to a fuel cell

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
which may last up to 14 hours per shift.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Huge savings for us because we're not changing batteries,

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
we're not recharging batteries so we have utility savings as well,

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
but also our selectors stay busy selecting groceries instead of swapping batteries out.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
They're a very smooth operating source of power.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
We've had good results from a handling standpoint.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
The units themselves weigh 600 pounds less than our previous batteries

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
and if you take the 600 pounds off, replace it with a new power cell,

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
the handle which the selector operates becomes much easier to move around

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
and that's been an added benefit.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
The employees that operate the triple pallet jacks have been positive

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
in their feedback about how they operate, how smooth they operate

28:56.000 --> 28:59.000
and so far we've had no negative feedback from them,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
which is probably the most important vote of confidence.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
The people that actually use this day in, day out as part of their tools to do their job

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
are enjoying the experience.

29:11.000 --> 29:17.000
The operators of these triple pallet jacks are responsible to fuel their unit when necessary.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
It operates much like a carb does in terms of a fuel gauge.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
When it does indicate it needs to be refueled,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
the selector comes to the fuel station and goes through a very quick process,

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
usually less than a minute to refuel his or her particular triple pallet jack.

29:33.000 --> 29:38.000
There are warehouses using this technology to various degrees already.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
We're on the front end of this change.

29:41.000 --> 29:47.000
I'd like to think in the future this entire facility will be powered by an alternative fuel source

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
and if Hydrogen's the answer, we're certainly one step forward in the right direction.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
Our customers are asking for better solutions.

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
They want to be quieter, they want to be lighter, they want to be smarter machines.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
Many of our products that are used for golf environments are in a situation where

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
they're used very early in the morning.

30:17.000 --> 30:22.000
A lot of golf courses are being built around houses and they want quiet equipment.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
Fuel cells are a solution for this.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.000
We don't want to have to sacrifice performance in order to get the benefits of electric power.

30:33.000 --> 30:38.000
So first of all, one of our guiding principles is that the machines will be able to do the same tasks

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
that you're used to and feel and operate much the same way.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Given that assumption, there are some differences.

30:45.000 --> 30:51.000
The components are different sized and different weights, so you have to repackage them in new areas.

30:51.000 --> 30:55.000
They have to be weather protected and environmental protected.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
They're basically off-road equipment.

30:59.000 --> 31:03.000
The fuel cells that we are using are called a PEM fuel cell.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
PEM stands for Proton Exchange Membrane and it's one of several types of fuel cells,

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
particularly suitable for mobile applications because they're compact, lightweight,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
they start up fast and they follow loads very quickly.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
We've chosen to use compressed hydrogen as a fuel storage onboard.

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
In order to get enough volume of hydrogen, we are operating at 5,000 psi tanks.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Keep the tanks lightweight instead of a thick heavy-walled steel tank.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
We've got a composite tank.

31:35.000 --> 31:41.000
They're a bladder, either aluminum or some kind of plastic wrapped with threads to make the tank strong enough.

31:41.000 --> 31:47.000
We're able to get lightweight power and we can refuel quickly with the hydrogen

31:47.000 --> 31:52.000
and batteries that are heavy and they take a lot of time to recharge.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Hydrogen in a fuel cell is clean.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
It is completely green and you give off water.

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
There's a lot fewer moving parts than in an engine, a lot less friction.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
As the industry evolves, there's no reason it shouldn't be able to get long life as one of its better attributes.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
In my opinion, hydrogen is safe when used properly.

32:15.000 --> 32:19.000
Systems have to be designed so that they're safe, people have to be trained.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Then it's just like handling any of these other high-energy contents.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
One of the key advantages that our industry has is that we are a fleet operation.

32:29.000 --> 32:35.000
Turf equipment on a golf course or a park system or something comes home the roost in the same building every night

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
and then is deployed during the day and comes back.

32:37.000 --> 32:44.000
The ability to put in one central refueling site to take care of a bunch of product is inherent to our business.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
It lets us become, I think, a niche market that can start to use fuel cells quicker than many other places.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
We got started in 1980.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
We brewed our first batch of beer at a smaller facility.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
I was a home brewer who turned commercial brewer.

33:05.000 --> 33:09.000
We've got 450 employees, seventh or eighth largest breweries in the country.

33:09.000 --> 33:12.000
Distribution in every state.

33:12.000 --> 33:20.000
I wanted to be more energy independent and so we started looking at ways to both conserve energy and be more energy efficient.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
Actually, going back to when we first started, I put in things like ice banks to store energy at night.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
So we've been embracing some of those concepts for a long time.

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
We've done a lot of optimization and put in current technology and some of those projects have two or three year payback.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
So it's not all done strictly for environmental benefit, but it's nice to get both.

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
Some of the projects don't have great returns and so you really couldn't justify them strictly on a return on investment basis.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
And we do a lot of what we do because we think it's the right thing.

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
And as a manufacturer, being in an industry that does utilize a lot of resources, we see it as one of our obligations to do our business in a sound manner

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
and look for ways to minimize inputs and to minimize waste streams.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
As a manufacturer, power needs are 24-7 because we have refrigeration and pumps and things that are operating.

34:12.000 --> 34:20.000
It was both from energy efficiency and from air emissions, I guess, that I really wanted to give the fuel cell a try.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.000
We've got four 250 kilowatt units that are considered a direct fuel cell, so they don't need a separate source of hydrogen.

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
They have an internal process that reforms the hydrogen out of the feed gas.

34:31.000 --> 34:37.000
So we feed it either biogas or natural gas and the process is part of the fuel cell stack.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
And so as the gas goes in, hydrogen gets separated and then that's fed into the fuel cell.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
We also have heat recovery boilers.

34:43.000 --> 34:50.000
We capture about a million and a quarter BTUs of energy back as steam and that goes back into our brewing process.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
The fuel cell is, I think, at the top as far as overall conversion of that input energy to output electricity.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Having the distributed power generation, you're not losing power through transmission line loss.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
If you can co-generate and use the heat and the electricity, you've picked up even more.

35:06.000 --> 35:12.000
So I think our overall efficiency is approaching 70% for our input energy with the heat recovery,

35:12.000 --> 35:18.000
which would be close to double, I think, what the average fossil fuel plant would be putting out.

35:18.000 --> 35:24.000
As far as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide and other things that are normal combustion byproducts,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
none of those that are emitted from the fuel cell.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
All of our fermenters are tied into pipes where we can collect the carbon dioxide that's naturally produced from fermentation.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
And that's compressed and cleaned up and stored and allows us to have our own source of CO2 here.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Normally, breweries would purchase that if they don't recover it.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
And so now that we've recovered ours, we have our own source of naturally produced carbon dioxide that's been captured

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
rather than emitted naturally produced carbon dioxide.

35:49.000 --> 35:53.000
It's used in the bottling process and moving beer around and dispensing beer.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
So we've just completed a pretty big solar array.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
I think we'll have one of the largest in the country.

35:57.000 --> 36:02.000
So that's pretty exciting and we're using sort of new inverter technology that's very efficient.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
So we're doing a good job converting sun's energy into electricity.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Middle part of the day, we're drawing more power.

36:07.000 --> 36:13.000
So when our solar panels are putting out their maximum is when our power consumption is at its maximum as well.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
When the solar's not working, we have our fuel cells giving us our base load.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
So it's a good combination for us.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
We actually have our own herd of cattle.

36:21.000 --> 36:28.000
We feed our spent grain to the cattle and the manure from that is composted and put back on our hops field.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
So we have a fairly closed loop on our hops here on site.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
We do treat all of our own wastewater.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
So we take all of our waste streams, our liquid waste from the brewing process, spilled beer, yeast, bits of hops and malt.

36:40.000 --> 36:47.000
And that's fed into a digester which produces between 35 to 70 cubic feet a minute of methane.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
And then that methane is fed to the fuel cells.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
We use a mix of biogas and natural gas.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Since it's more efficient, it'll be cheaper to produce power this way.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
Up to close to 80% of our own electrical power needs generated here on site.

37:02.000 --> 37:11.000
Our goal will be to get to 100% power generation and through both conservation efforts and some additional power generation, I think we can get there.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I think it works for a lot of other industries.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
We get a lot of visitors here.

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I know there's quite a few hotels in one group that's put in fuel cells.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
One of the local casinos has put them in.

37:22.000 --> 37:28.000
So if you have a need for both heat and electricity on a continuous basis, you can justify this kind of technology.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.000
The California Fuel Cell Partnership is a collaboration amongst industry and government.

37:39.000 --> 37:48.000
We have members from the automotive industry, energy companies, fuel cell technology companies, as well as government from state, local and federal levels.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
We're working together to promote the commercialization of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles.

37:55.000 --> 38:04.000
Many years ago when we were dealing with trying to reduce smog in the face of our continued population and vehicle growth here in California,

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
we looked and said we really need to have zero emission vehicles or something that's very, very close.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And there were two technologies available.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
One was battery electric vehicles.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
The other technology was fuel cell vehicles.

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
With this particular vehicle, it actually has a hydrogen fuel cell system in it.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
And what that system is, we have high pressure hydrogen stored in the vehicle.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.000
This fuel cell itself actually converts this electrochemically to electricity, which drives the vehicle.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
What I tend to get comments about is the sound or lack of it.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
In this particular vehicle, this platform, we have a compressor, which makes a little bit of noise.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
But overall, it's about as quiet as it can be.

38:40.000 --> 38:44.000
When we first started this program, you know, we had a lot of vehicle issues and stuff like that.

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
I have to say that we've definitely turned that around to where these vehicles are very reliable.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
We have them out in a fleet over the whole country.

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
And we're very impressed with the way they perform and handle and their reliability.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
Oftentimes, I get comments about how stable it feels, how it doesn't feel like a prototype.

39:03.000 --> 39:06.000
It feels very much like a car that you could just go out and buy.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
And obviously, the next question I get is, why can't I get it now?

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
The most common comment I see is that the vehicle is really cool.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
When you get in the vehicle and you drive around in general,

39:16.000 --> 39:20.000
there's not much of a difference between that vehicle and a conventional vehicle.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.000
It drives about the same, better pickup in the city, better acceleration, a little quieter.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
But when they know that it's boarding hydrogen and has a fuel cell,

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
it has this cool green feel to it, and that's what people respond to.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
We have real-world customers, so we'll have real-world feedback.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
The customer can cope with infrastructure, with the vehicle durability, with the range issues.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
The customer compares the vehicle just to a normal, standard car.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
That's why we have custom operation because it's not only important to have technology advancement,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
but also to listen closely to what the customer says,

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
because at the end of the day, if the customer does not buy your nice piece of technical equipment,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
the whole technology is a failure.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.000
With a battery-electric vehicle, you have to make the electricity somehow to recharge the batteries.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
With this vehicle, you have to make the hydrogen somehow.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
The hydrogen tanks are right under the rear seats.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
The fuel cell system is located under the front seats, the driver and passenger seats.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
The electric motor is up front, and then in the back, under the cargo compartment, there's a battery.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
And the battery works with the fuel cell to provide electricity to the electric motor.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
The battery does the same thing that it does in a hybrid car, which is called regenerative braking.

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
And what happens is when we're slowing down, the energy that otherwise would have just been wasted through the brakes

40:44.000 --> 40:49.000
is actually captured in the battery, and then when you need power to accelerate or go up a hill,

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
both the battery and the fuel cell can put electric power to the electric motors.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
This vehicle is equipped with leak detectors that will immediately tell you if there's a leak,

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
so you know to pull over, get the vehicle towed to a place that could be repaired.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Hydrogen is very, very light, so if there is a leak, it tends to disperse very rapidly.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
The hydrogen storage tanks in these vehicles are incredibly well-designed, very strong, fiber-wrapped cylinders.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
They've done extensive testing with them to ensure that they're as safe as possible.

41:16.000 --> 41:22.000
It has a neat safety feature where there's some little side pillars in the rear of the vehicle, you can see.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
And there's tubes running up from the hydrogen tanks through those side pillars up to a pressure release valve,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
which is a little bump you see on the roof of the car.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
So if there's an accident, the system will detect a loss of pressure,

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
and the hydrogen will be immediately vented through the pressure release valve on the roof.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
You can measure hydrogen in terms of volume. You can talk about gallons or liters of hydrogen.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
But because the volume changes at different pressures, we tend to think of it in terms of weight.

41:43.000 --> 41:47.000
A certain amount of hydrogen is going to weigh the same regardless of what pressure it's at.

41:47.000 --> 41:51.000
One kilogram of hydrogen stores as much energy as one gallon of gasoline.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
This vehicle stores about two kilograms of hydrogen.

41:54.000 --> 42:00.000
Because it's under high pressure, that pump, when I clamped the nozzle onto the gas tank, it has to form a very tight seal.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
And unless the pump knows that there's a very tight seal, the pump won't even turn on.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
So it's got a lot of safety built into it.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Right now, we're at a very interesting stage of development of this technology.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
In some ways, fuel cells are an easier fit for buses than they are for cars.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
You don't get much cleaner than a fuel cell bus, that's for sure.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's a zero-emission vehicle.

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
We're the first to actually build a fleet of fuel cell buses for an actual heavy-duty transit application.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
New Flyer Industries is the largest manufacturer in North America of heavy-duty transit vehicles.

42:32.000 --> 42:40.000
Currently have about 17,000 buses on the road at almost 250 different transit agencies.

42:40.000 --> 42:50.000
Because of the fact that we had the Vancouver Winter Olympics, there was a drive to showcase and demonstrate green technology.

42:50.000 --> 42:56.000
When the contract was originally tendered to do the fuel cell buses for the Olympics,

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
we proceeded to develop an initial prototype, which would eventually serve as the mold for our production.

43:02.000 --> 43:09.000
One of the big challenges with developing a fuel cell bus is to make sure that it can operate in the cold temperature environment.

43:09.000 --> 43:18.000
Once we were satisfied with that, then we proceeded with the production to build the 20 buses for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics.

43:18.000 --> 43:25.000
In most ways, the vehicle went through our standard production line, our standard production stations.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
The only difference was that there were a few extra steps at certain points in the line,

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
where we had to install the fuel tanks and some of the other hybrid components,

43:33.000 --> 43:38.000
but we were able to incorporate that all within our existing processes and equipment.

43:38.000 --> 43:47.000
Because we're a low-floor design, which all our buses are nowadays for wheelchair accessibility and ease of getting on and off for passengers,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
one of the challenges with that is that the bus is very low to the ground,

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
so there's no room under the bus to really install much equipment.

43:54.000 --> 44:03.000
With the large number of components that are required for the fuel cell bus in terms of the hydrogen tanks, the batteries, the cooling systems,

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
all that takes up a lot of space. We ended up putting quite a few of the components on the roof of the vehicle,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
as well as in the rear engine compartment.

44:11.000 --> 44:19.000
From a static standpoint, you would actually have a lot of trouble just from a quick glance telling a fuel cell bus apart from a regular bus.

44:19.000 --> 44:23.000
If you were to walk on and sit in a seat, you wouldn't notice much out of the ordinary

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
and the stuff you don't see, which makes the technology interesting.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
The big challenge is operating a hydrogen fuel cell coach in cold weather.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.000
The primary byproduct of the chemical reaction is water.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
Of course, we run into the issue of what happens when you drop below zero degrees Celsius.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
If you don't design for that, you can certainly run the risk of freezing that water,

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
which can definitely damage portions of your fuel cell.

44:46.000 --> 44:54.000
One of the initial things we had to work on was a way to plug in the vehicles overnight to ensure that the fuel cell didn't freeze.

44:54.000 --> 44:59.000
The other big challenge is how do you ensure that on those cold days that you have enough heat available

44:59.000 --> 45:03.000
so that you can properly start the bus and then once the bus is running,

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
how do you ensure that you have enough heat available so that everybody is comfortable within the vehicle.

45:08.000 --> 45:15.000
One of the aspects about the fuel cell bus design is that it uses electric motors to drive the wheels.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
The fuel cell itself does not actually directly drive the vehicle.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
All it does is convert hydrogen to electricity.

45:22.000 --> 45:27.000
So that electricity is used to drive motors and other systems on the vehicle.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
One of the advantages of an electric motor is that at very low speeds they generate a high amount of torque.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
The acceleration is very good.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
The other big advantage is the braking because we have an electric system on the bus

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
with very powerful storage batteries and generators.

45:43.000 --> 45:49.000
We're able to regain energy from the braking system when the vehicle stops.

45:49.000 --> 45:54.000
And not only does that increase the life of your brake pads and allow you to charge up your electrical system,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
but it also gives you a lot of stopping power.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
Hydrogen buses are designed to work very similar to the way the diesel bus is as far as duty cycle,

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
and they're able to perform all the same functions as a standard diesel bus.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
Our buses have a range of about 300 to 325 miles.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
Diesel buses, and again this fuel cell bus,

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
dependent on a route service, it can be out from anywhere from a trip or run,

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
which is just a few hours up to 16, 17, even 18 hours without any trouble.

46:26.000 --> 46:34.000
These buses, because of extra infrastructure on the roof for gas, storage, for all the additional components,

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
they're over 8,000 pounds heavier than the comparable diesel bus.

46:39.000 --> 46:46.000
But in spite of that, we're seeing as much as 100% or double the fuel economy over a diesel bus.

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
The main thing everybody notices is how quiet and smooth that the vehicle is in comparison to a standard diesel bus.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
There's no transmission on it, so it's very smooth, powers away very quietly.

46:59.000 --> 47:04.000
We have had some comments from riders that the bus is actually too quiet.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
You can actually sneak up on them.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
They've been surprised when it pulls up to the curb, and they didn't even realize it was there.

47:11.000 --> 47:18.000
With the fuel cell technology, this bus doesn't care where the hydrogen comes from,

47:18.000 --> 47:26.000
and the value of hydrogen in transportation applications is that we can make hydrogen from solar and wind and biomass.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
Here we're using natural gas.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
While it's not completely zero emission, it has some CO2 emissions.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.000
Well to wheel, it's still better than our regular diesel internal combustion engine vehicles.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
They're basically a large golf cart, and there's not a lot of maintenance on a golf cart.

47:43.000 --> 47:50.000
One of the largest maintenance items for any bus is the brakes, and with these vehicles having regenerative braking,

47:50.000 --> 47:55.000
we're hoping to realize better brake life than the cost savings associated with that.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
We're learning from these buses.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
We're learning from other examples throughout the world.

47:59.000 --> 48:06.000
All the supercomputers of the world, all the brilliant minds that delivered the technology in the first place,

48:06.000 --> 48:15.000
can't think of every variable, and what we do here is we capture almost all the variables that they can't think of.

48:15.000 --> 48:24.000
And we're all learning from this, not just us as users, but the technology providers are seeing things that they couldn't replicate in the labs.

48:24.000 --> 48:31.000
We're very much committed to looking at alternative fuels to improve our environmental footprint.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
Zero emission from the tailpipe, virtually no noise from the engine,

48:36.000 --> 48:45.000
and the potential of addressing global warming, climate change issues, sustainable energy supplies to fuel our vehicles,

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
to help us reach energy independence.

48:47.000 --> 48:58.000
Our end state goal is commercialization so that all of the transit buses in the United States we would like to see as zero emission fuel cell buses.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
Hydrogen has been used safely throughout our economy.

49:04.000 --> 49:11.000
We use most of the hydrogen today to make cleaner gasoline, but it's also used in food manufacturing and consumer products.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
If you look at hydrogen compared to gasoline, certainly both fuels have a lot of energy content.

49:17.000 --> 49:22.000
You must pay attention to safety considerations when using the fuel.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
Hydrogen is no less safe than gasoline, it's just different.

49:26.000 --> 49:33.000
If there is a hydrogen leak, it's very light and so it will go up and rise immediately and dissipate into the atmosphere.

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
It's totally non-toxic, it won't cause health problems or environmental problems if it is released into the atmosphere.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
All vehicle fuels can be dangerous.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
If they weren't, they wouldn't be useful as fuel.

49:48.000 --> 49:55.000
The trick for any fuel is to engineer it so that it is as safe as currently available technologies.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
Today that's gasoline in conventional vehicles.

49:58.000 --> 50:07.000
And most people I know working with hydrogen believe that hydrogen is either as safe or safer than gasoline is today.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
It is safer than gasoline.

50:09.000 --> 50:17.000
Most people say today that if you were to have a gasoline engine today and you were trying to bring it on the market for the very first time,

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
there would be no way that you would be able to put that gasoline engine onto the marketplace.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.000
It just wouldn't happen.

50:23.000 --> 50:34.000
I quite sincerely believe and I've seen test evidence that supports my conclusion that the gas tank in the suburban that I drive is more dangerous than a hydrogen fuel tank.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
We have conducted 120,000 fuelings worldwide already.

50:39.000 --> 50:47.000
We know hydrogen can be delivered, compressed and dispensed into vehicles very safely, as safely if not more safely than traditional fuels.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
We've done extensive safety training with our maintenance and service personnel.

50:51.000 --> 51:00.000
We've worked with some very good partners that have designed some very good systems, our fueling station, our facility upgrades,

51:00.000 --> 51:09.000
all incorporate hydrogen sensors and fire sensors and very robust systems to track that.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Safety was a big part of it.

51:11.000 --> 51:19.000
I wanted to make sure that the testing that they had done was adequate for our employees' benefit as well as for the community.

51:19.000 --> 51:25.000
I am good fortune to drive a fuel cell car on a regular basis and I use it to take my kids to school,

51:25.000 --> 51:29.000
go to the baseball practice, go grocery shopping, come to work.

51:29.000 --> 51:33.000
When they fuel the car, there's no fumes or drips of gasoline.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
I'd much rather drive my fuel cell vehicle than my gasoline vehicle.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
Icelandic New Energy was founded in 1999.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
It's a joint venture company.

51:45.000 --> 51:53.000
It's owned 51% by Icelandic shareholders, which groups together the energy companies, the government, the academia like the university,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
the innovation center, investment funds and private investors.

51:56.000 --> 52:02.000
All the key players in Iceland to have anything to do with hydrogen are joined into one company.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
Then we have Daimler, Shell Hydrogen and Statoil Hydro from Norway, which are the other three investors.

52:08.000 --> 52:18.000
The goal of the company is to be kind of an enabler to evaluate the possibility of creating the first hydrogen society in the world here in Iceland.

52:18.000 --> 52:25.000
They foresaw Iceland as a perfect test ground because they knew that all the energy sources to produce the hydrogen would be or renewable,

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
coming from hydro or geothermal.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
This ship is of course mainly a touristic boat, whale watching.

52:30.000 --> 52:36.000
On the ship you have 150 people traveling for three or four hours at the consecutive time.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
We put a fuel cell engine on a commercial boat.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
This is actually the fuel cell unit.

52:41.000 --> 52:45.000
The hydrogen storage is actually back in the engine room.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
So you have hydrogen pipelines coming in connected to the fuel cell unit.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
And then we actually have a hybrid system.

52:51.000 --> 52:57.000
So we are also having a little bit of battery packs to have enough power for all the auxiliaries in the boat.

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
There have been some technical hiccups on the way, but that's one of the reasons why you do projects like this,

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
to learn how and which problems we're faced with taking hydrogen out to sea.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
There is now a project in Germany to build a ship powered solely by hydrogen.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
And they designed the ship around the hydrogen.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
What we did here is we basically put hydrogen on board an existing ship.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
And there are some complications with that.

53:22.000 --> 53:29.000
The main issue is how to get certification and how to fulfill all the strict regulation on having hydrogen on a ship.

53:29.000 --> 53:37.000
I think those have been the most important learning steps and teaches us a lot about how to do next steps

53:37.000 --> 53:41.000
regarding using hydrogen as part of a marine fuel.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
Usually when they go out for whale watching, when you see whales, they actually want to shut down the engine

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
to get rid of the noise and get rid of the vibration of the ship.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
Before they had to run at least the auxiliary engine on diesel, so you still have some noise and some vibration.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
So what they do now is when they find whales, they actually can shut down the whole system.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
The only operation is the fuel cell.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
And that means no vibration, no noise and no emissions.

54:04.000 --> 54:10.000
And that's actually pretty cool when you're sitting in the middle of the Atlantic with absolutely no movement whatsoever.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
And you can see the whales peacefully.

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
I think people are very positive towards using the domestic energy sources to power everything we actually can.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
We are quite confident about the hydrogen infrastructure.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
We don't think that will be a hindrance or a barrier to a hydrogen society.

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
People are very keen on what can we do and they're realizing that the things we can actually do will also be clean.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
So that's a very big added benefit.

54:37.000 --> 54:42.000
You also have to think about how much CO2 savings are in using hydrogen.

54:42.000 --> 54:47.000
It's all about the environment and if we can also power the ship partly by hydrogen,

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
which is in at least Iceland, the totally clean energy chain, that's of course a beautiful picture.

54:55.000 --> 55:01.000
From power plants to wind turbines, city buses to lawn equipment, breweries to warehouses,

55:01.000 --> 55:06.000
hydrogen and fuel cells are quietly improving our ability to deliver clean,

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
economical energy in our homes or cars and where we work.

55:12.000 --> 55:18.000
As the world thirst for energy continues to grow and environmental costs mount,

55:18.000 --> 55:23.000
hydrogen provides us with the choice to create our own clean energy future.
