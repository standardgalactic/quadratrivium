1. **Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) in the Age of Globalization**: The Cold War strategy of MAD, which relied on the threat of mutual annihilation to deter nuclear war, is no longer viable in a world with numerous actors and multiple types of weapons. Globalization has increased interconnectedness but also fragility, making the world more susceptible to cascading breakdowns due to supply chain dependencies and resource constraints.

2. **Fragility and Risk**: The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated our global vulnerability to catastrophic risks, such as pandemics or climate change. Efforts to mitigate one risk, like stopping travel to contain the virus, can lead to unintended negative consequences, such as food insecurity and economic downturns, which can exacerbate conflicts and social instability.

3. **Resource Scarcity and Conflict**: Climate change and resource depletion are creating conditions for conflict. For example, severe heatwaves and water scarcity in India could lead to massive crop failures, potentially worsening already tense religious and communal tensions, which could escalate into larger conflicts.

4. **Global Coordination**: The current global situation calls for increased coordination to address catastrophic risks effectively. However, this is not yet happening on a sufficient scale, which could lead to more severe crises in the future.

5. **Food Insecurity and Conflict**: The World Food Program has warned that up to 265 million people are at risk of starvation within the next 24 months due to disruptions caused by COVID-19. This underscores the potential for conflicts to arise or be exacerbated in the face of such widespread resource scarcity, even without high-tech weaponry.

6. **Local Resource Scarcity and Global Impact**: A local issue like food scarcity can have far-reaching global implications, potentially leading to social unrest, insurgencies, and conflict if communities perceive that others have access to resources they lack.

In summary, the world is increasingly fragile due to globalization, resource constraints, and interconnected systems that can be disrupted by a wide range of risks, including pandemics, climate change, and supply chain issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted these vulnerabilities, demonstrating that even less lethal but highly disruptive events can lead to significant social and economic challenges, which in turn can escalate into conflicts that are not necessarily tied to military capabilities. Effective global coordination is crucial to mitigate these risks and prevent cascading failures that could spiral into large-scale crises.
