Daniel, thank you so much for coming, Tom. As always, great to see you. Daniel,
you and I have been friends for a while. I've learned a lot from you. Thanks for spending
some time with us here. At a time when many of us in the world were learning how to ride a bike,
you were studying complex systems, you were studying engineering, self-awareness, cognitive
science, philosophy. You are an extraordinary autodidact. When I was introduced to you, the person
introduced us said you are one of the brightest people in the world. I kind of wondered in the
time I've spent with you, I've realized that's probably certainly true if not an understatement.
You've done meaningful work on catastrophic risk scenarios and avoidance. That's really
where we began to get to know each other when I was working on warnings. You continue to focus in
a world spun out of control and the systems solutions needed to heal it. You call it long-term
civilization design, I think. You advise big, bold name technical leaders and technologists
and scientists. You're a hero of people in the world trying to make sense of an increasingly
nonsensical and increasingly dangerous globe. You're launching an initiative called the
Consilience Project, which I'm honored to be a small part of. I hope we can talk about that a bit
today. You spoke at the Flashpoints Forum conference last year. You and I jammed a lot of your wisdom
into a very short lunch session. That's the worst time of the day to speak. I still thank you for
doing that. I noticed in that talk at the Flashpoints Forum conversation when you were
speaking at lunch in the front row was a prime minister with whom I've worked for years. He's
a very serious man. Some people think of him as a very difficult man. He's clearly a technical
genius and I've never seen him so entrenched. I've never seen him so fascinated. I've never seen him
so amazed and I've never seen his face slightly puzzled and I saw all those things on his face
when you were speaking at our conference last year. That's often how I feel when we get the
chance to talk. I hope to bring some of that wisdom to our listeners today, many of whom
will meet you for the first time through this show. I also hope that we can get into a conversation
about your complex thoughts on how to fix our big minds in our world and then I'd love to be able
to get you and Tom to spend some time comparing and contrasting his deep thinking, his big successes,
trying to heal our hearts. I think it's going to be a powerful conversation between the two of you
as well. I'm going to be up all night because I know this conversation is going to fire me up.
I also, having to be prepared at 6 p.m., had a cup of coffee or I'm drinking a cup of coffee right
now at 6 or else I would be tremendously outgunned. I'll only be slightly outgunned with a cup of
coffee, I hope. So here's to this. Daniel, thanks so much for being with us and it's an honor.
A question to be here over, ridiculously over generous introduction, but
there's a lot of things I'm very curious about that I've been trying to sense make and I'm looking
forward to the conversation today. Let me ask you about the Elf in the Room. It's more than the
Elf in the Room. It's the thing on everyone's mind. It's the front of every newspaper and every news
feed, which is the coming election for President of the United States. You spent a lot of time thinking
about existential and catastrophic risks. Something, what is it? 35% of the voters right now believe
this election, maybe a quarter, is existential. They're extraordinarily concerned about the outcome
here. There's a lot of other people who are very concerned. There's almost no one who isn't quite
concerned about where this election is going. Just broadly, I wondered if you had any introductory
thoughts about does this election matter that much? What does this election mean and what kind of
things are you looking for as election unfolds and the new president sits in relation to your
concerns about sort of long-term civilization survival? Yeah, I'll say I have more questions
about it than very solid predictions, but a few things in terms of how I'm looking at it.
What are you looking for? What's interesting to you? What do you think the outcome is?
What are the stakes? I think this election is unique in modern history of having two things
both through the case, that a huge amount of the population on both sides anticipates the election
being stolen or rigged or somehow unfairly judged to have questions around the election integrity
so that no matter who ends up being considered to win, it will be considered an illegitimate win
by a huge percentage of the population, and that combined with a huge percent of the population on
both sides thinking it's existential. So the Trump camp, having many people that think if
that Trump is the only thing that stands between some kind of globalist set of agendas and the
debasing of national integrity of the US completely, and the anti-Trump camp that holds that Trump
getting in will be the end of the republic because he'll create a dynasty and like formally the end
of the republic. So what do we do in a situation where the chance of the election being contested
because of mail-in ballots and all kinds of things is very high? The Supreme Court, the
Electoral College, the Senate, whoever might come in to try and adjudicate that is also not really
understood or trusted by citizens widely. All of the journalistic incentive is for inflammation
and we end up getting a situation where the government is considered illegitimate with an
illegitimate president in an existential consequential way to coming up on half of the
citizenry no matter which way it goes. I think this is a huge issue and I think
RPSU and Ergo were looking at being able to predict social violence as it arose with the
riots coming out of the protests from COVID. We didn't know what would spark it. We knew there
were like a handful of things but we knew that when unemployment goes up that much, the social
violence possibility goes up pretty heavily. Well, we still have very high unemployment. We have
high eviction. We have increasing embodied polarization around racial issues, around left
right issues, around mask, no mask, COVID reality issues. And so now we're looking at this on top
of all of that and the actual kind of like insurgency and militia on both far right and far
left preparation. So I think we're moving, I think the election is going to be really problematic
and I would say for, or it very easily can be. I would say if there's a period of time where
it is contested and the US doesn't have a clear executive branch, what the rest of the world
does probably not towards the US directly but as far as power grabs internationally for
geopolitical influences, also a very big question, not just what happens socially, domestically.
One of the pieces of history I would say is for people that don't have a good
thinking of history, democracies don't live very long historically. They typically die in less
than 300 years. We're at about 250 years on this one. No civilization or empire is
enduring forever. They all end up falling and there are certain characteristics that when we
look at the fall of previous empires and previous democracies that we can kind of find that generally
play out and we see those types of things playing out pretty well here. So for me, and we already
don't have something that's really like a republic. We don't have a government of foreign by the people
that are comprehensively educated or have an unbiased or the state where they know what's going
on and they're actively engaged in the functions of the state. We have a permanent political class
with a rotating door between the market that it's supposed to regulate and the regulators that
end up getting captured by it and basically narrative and info warfare having replaced news
and public education having been eroded. And so the question for me is, and then you also see that
like when you have term limits and we understand why we have term limits, it's very hard to do
long term planning for anyone who has an incentive to have things that will pay off within the time
of their term limit. When you have massive left-right polarization for the two-party system,
you end up having so much of the energy go into the coordination cost of just getting
elected and trying to keep what everything you did going that the ability to coordinate well as
a nation is very low. So then you see over the last 20 years, China's ability with something
more like an embership to build high speed rail all around the world and infrastructure all around
the world when we still can't fix roads. And between that and Turkey and Venezuela and Brazil
and movements in India, we can see a more autocratic direction globally as one of the trends.
And we can also see why is because the idea of a democratic or participatory governance where
lots of people who see the world differently all work together is actually a ridiculous proposition.
Like it's a really hard thing to make that work well. And I would say that there is a level of
civilization fabric, social fabric that underlies that even being possible,
which is, you know, George Washington saying the number one aim of government should be the
comprehensive education of every citizen in the science of government. And I think it was Franklin
who said, if I could have perfect government and broken news or perfect news and broken government,
I'd take the perfect news because when people really know what's going on, they can remake
government. If they don't know what's going on, they can't possibly make good decisions.
And if we think of or a public or a democracy as a participatory choice making process for
consequential choices that are kind of shared across us, we have to have participatory sense
making and high quality communication to be able to coordinate and enough like political
understanding to know that politics is how you sublimate warfare. Like how you make compromises
with people that think really differently than you and value different things where
a compromise is better than warfare. So you actually can't just ignore and villainize them.
You actually have to listen to and work with them. So these are a few thoughts related to the
position the US is in. And so what I see is that we are at a place where the US has decayed to a
level where either it just has decreasing relevance in the world moving forward or it needs a reboot.
And the reboot of a real kind of republic has to be bottom up. It has to actually be citizenry
that are getting comprehensively educated about how to make sense of the world rather than just
get captured by some tribalistic narrative warfare kind of narrative that have to get
much more media literate and that have to get have to have to start to have a value around
good faith understanding, not just pejorative strawman of the people that hold the other view
to be able to say how can we work together because those other people don't stop existing just
because I stopped listening. So the Prime Minister's face is now getting puzzled. So I want to I want
to break this into a small building blocks for everybody today. First I'm reminded of a quote
well not a quote H.R. McMaster and I know you familiar with him and you've seen our interview
with him makes the point in our interview in his book that the deterrence effect of an educated
populace is extraordinary and necessary and we don't have that. I just wanted to touch on that
quick thing but previously back on the election a lot of people think it's existential. A lot of
people think it's rigged. It's very likely to be contested probably over you know over 30% likely
which is a humongous number that it's going to be dramatically contested. You put that on top of
massive distrust in our government to start with 65% of people believe the economy is rigged and
they're probably right based on where they're sitting and you talk a lot about narrative warfare
replacing news. So let's start with that for a second. We had Tristan Harris on here who's saying
his praises about you and all the work you did with the social dilemma which I wasn't surprised
after having watched the movie that you know you had a lot of your fingerprints on it.
Let's talk about narrative warfare. What's it mean that narrative warfare is replacing news?
I would say there's cycles of this throughout history. You can read Sun Tzu and hear about
narrative and info warfare thousands of years ago right but how to control what people believe
is true and what they think both as a political and military strategies as old as civilization.
As far as in the current environment a few things that I would say are particularly
key and you probably covered this with Tristan well. The movement from broadcast news to largely
decentralize social media based uptake of the media environment is one of the most significant
factors in the contemporary environment because our governmental institutions were built in the
era of and around broadcast capability from the printing press which was broadcast through the
telegraph through the radio through the TV it was basically one to many type broadcasts with very
few people having access to the mechanisms of broadcast and everyone else receiving relatively
unified messages so of course they could be distorted right of course you could have some moguls
having more political or economic influence affecting the news so we're not saying it was at
all perfect but at least as far as social coherence goes everyone was seeing something
relatively similar when there was three news stations when you have a and to the degree
that it's wrong there's at least some accountability and there's not as much just complete overwhelm
and the overwhelm drives a kind of epistemic nihilism where people don't really even think they can
really make sense of it and then they're more just oriented to pick sides and defect towards
strongman leaders let's not skip over that that's a fascinating idea i haven't heard you mention before
because there's so much news coming out of so fast people get overwhelmed and feel like they
can't keep up though in fact they're just looking at you know a huge different many different facets
of similar news or fake news and and that becomes overwhelming to them and they feel sort of left
behind yeah i mean flooding problem you'll see interviews or polls where russians are asked
if they think putin lies to them in the news publicly and it's you know extremely high 70 90
percent say yes but then they also he has that high of an approval rating and in a situation where
they felt um their country was kind of drained after the wall by the way capitalism came in
nato's attacks on them whatever it was like having a strong man leader including having
to lie just existentially safer and i think in situations like current environment
people's ability to really make sense of climate change how long do we have how serious is it going
to be is like are we all just is my 401k even matter we all about to be completely screwed
and it seems like there are scientists who disagree on this and is china really close to
some kind of world domination plan or not it seems like there's very kind of different views on that
and hydroxychloroquine masks covid whatever right like disagreement on base reality across so many
things and the ability to say well let me look at all the science that really try to make sense
people don't have the time or the skill and so there is then just a place where they start to
resonate with both leaders and subgroups that are more like them and so epistemology gets replaced
by tribalism so it's similar to when under stress we revert to type you're saying when under an
overwhelming amount of information we still revert to type overwhelming amount of information and
dissonance of information and this is where fud becomes a strategy right so fear uncertainty
and doubt on purpose because then since people can't make sense of it then rhetoric works better
and then have the strong rhetoric and and people don't want to be outgrouped and they do want to
be part of an in group whose rhetoric appeals to the aesthetics of that in group you'll notice that
the way that the demo left-leaning a left-leaning politician will kind of stir up the crowd
doesn't appeal to people on the right like as an aesthetic they're like i don't care if you call
me racist right now and i'm not like saw climate change doesn't move me and whatever and similarly
the way that someone on the right talking that about national security or protecting our borders
whatever doesn't appeal to the people on the left so there's and it's it's a belief system but it's
all the way down to almost like a cultural aesthetic that the rhetoric can move people who
share a cultural aesthetic beyond the actual epistemology beyond them saying well what are
the actual national security risks what is my basis for knowing and how clear am i on that or
what are the actual you know border issues or climate change issues so yes i would say
epistemology being replaced by tribalism is one of the really huge issues and so then
now we we're talking about the movement to decentralize media so let me let me stop you
and i'm going to do this a little bit so we can we can keep people from losing you
so flooding becomes a strategy i think that's a fantastic insight there's no longer a shared
reality there's no longer a modern name Walter Cronkite social media and others are limbically
hijacking us they know precisely how to do it our monkey brains throughout the entire process are
being driven back to tribalism is there a threshold beyond which it's impossible to reel the public
back into a shared reality is there a point where people are so disillusioned and warped by
misinformation disinformation that they can no longer be reached by even our best efforts and
if so are we getting to a point where too many people in this country are are thereby lost
if we keep the things that are conditioning people and increasingly polarized directions in
place yes we get to a place where interventions would be very hard but like no matter how riled
up somebody is on on the left or the right about whatever like ready to take to the
street with guns about it all they have to do is just scroll instagram for a while folk where
political stuff isn't occurring but just social pictures are and engage in entertainment a little
bit and they'll mostly forget about it because there's such a flood of other kinds of stimuli
the reason why they don't forget about is because that media stimuli is continuing to come through
the instagram and the facebook repeat and the whatever it is pretty often if we could change the
media environment because i think basically it's there's a it's not just that it was in culture
and now it's the case especially given how little time most people spend in embodied space with each
other and how much social interaction has become virtualized through a screen and how much of it
is then the artifact of this of the social media platforms
so do i think that if we were able to change the kind of media environment that people were in
that we could actually and change where people are taking into their minds that we could change it
relatively reasonably yes i do now how to do that's quite a hard problem
i don't remember the word you used rp but when you think about sort of this the social media
limbic thing is because they got good at figuring out how to draw your attention right
but there's another part of that where it's almost like the marketplace
of algorithms that's just going to do what it's going to do right and i know they can control
it to a certain point but basically they're they're going to distract they're going to
they're going to make that limbic stuff get all limbic-y right because that's what they're learning
how to do right in what it with whatever method they may use and so okay so that's just one side
of the equation all i'm trying to say there is like it's almost like a benign evil that's going on
over there to a certain extent and you know there's also all kinds of you know incentive-based reasons
why they may not want to fix any of those things but then i even wonder to what extent they even
could but let's let's put that aside for one second on the other side of the equation
and i think we're all gonna marvel at this one day some of us already do this guy trump
is outrageous like this guy's the biggest media star in the history of the planet bar none i mean
that guy's name has showed up in more places in more parts of this world more times than any human
ever right it's just outrageous what a big kind of media star this is so what what he has is a certain
kind of charisma whatever you want to call it you use a different word i don't really care i don't
want anyone to think it's a compliment or not all i'm trying to say is like this guy puts on a show
like nobody we've ever seen and if you think of the last two presidents we've had we went from a
big time rock star superstar which was barack obama and that's when we were kind of moving
out of the old days and we came into whatever you call this guy the biggest circus performer in
the history of the world i don't know and you just imagine like imagine if trump was like
a little more regan-esque now i know those two things may not go together all i'm trying to say
is if he if he sought a more broad appeal of a certain kind like god imagine what he might do
now you may not have the capability of doing that kind of a thing anyway i'm getting verbose here
but the thing i wonder is in the end might our best hope be
charisma tied to reason like i just don't know what other things what other person what other
group other than maybe that because let's let one other thing i want to say before i stop
if you think about what joe biden is i mean you're talking about an old white guy like really old
like will be the oldest president of all time who is anyone really voting for joe biden i mean
really when it comes right down to it i understand lots and lots and lots of people are voting
against donald trump i get it they're voting for a certain democratic platform but in the end like
wow are we at an interesting time and at a minimum like just put yourself in let's say
biden wins and now it's august of 2021 what's going on is he really the charismatic leader that's
changing this world is that really what's going to happen or is it just going to be noise city
just all kinds of new kinds of noises that are coming from all these other weird places
based on this new reality that maybe biden for the first time will teach us just how wild it is
because this sort of calm older guy sitting at the middle of it and it's still not orderly
that's what i fear anyway i just said a lot yeah so what i kind of hear you saying is um
that the charisma of a person speaking is its own limbic hijack in addition wherever it is that
the algorithms do and then you have an interplay between those right between you have the limbic
hijack of what goes out on the media and then you have the limbic hijack of which of that is
specially selected on my news feed based on my interaction with it and obviously the news feed
can't limbically hijack me if it doesn't have content to put in there that has that effect
right so the you end up getting this reinforcement dynamic and you mentioned a benign evil so i'm
going to just address the social media thing for a minute and come back to the uh the the president
chrism a thing yes the social media algorithms whether we're talking about youtube's recommended
video algorithm or facebook's news feed algorithm when they drive political polarization or ideologic
entrenchment it's not their intention like there there is nobody there saying we want to make
you know antipa whatever um but in so far as they have to pick metrics to optimize and the
thing is just as powerful as it is yeah and time on site is a good metric to optimize for and because
of lots of reasons the advertising model is going to be relevant to how much time on site and how
many people are coming but even beyond just the pay and the advertising model it's their way of
sensing how much are people liking this thing right uh people's life is not that good spending
that much time on facebook or youtube their life would be better to get off and to the degree that
they're clear right that they're in their kind of executive function prefrontal cortex they would
check in quickly say i want to spend 15 minutes and then go about doing other things but if once
they've been scrolling for two hours that happened because they weren't in their executive function
right it happened because either they're fear of missing out or their desire for social cues
because there's lonely and there's lots of faces on there and largely photoshop faces or because of
their political outrage whatever it is but it's it's appealing to the things it would actually have
someone spend a lot of time that is not really well used time for them and so that drives addiction
because that's a limbic hijack right but it also drives things that scare me things that anger me
and um because if i see things that really scare me i'm not going to leave i'm going to feel like
i need to know this but then if there's a billion pieces of news on a topic and there's no way i
could ever take them all in what the youtube algorithm recommends for me or what the facebook
feed curates for me is the ones that based on my previous interactions the ones that i shared and
clicked on whatever are most likely to have me share and click on them so that means that it appeals
to bias and it appeals to emotionality so when you have a population where everyone's bias and
emotionality is getting doubled down on then you get increasing in-group tribalism and increasing
out-group antipathy right and it's very strong and people don't know it's happening because
let's say that i'm going down the youtube recommended videos or i'm going down the news feed i can
scroll down the news feed forever and keep getting more of the same type of stuff so it seems like
that's the whole world and of course because what's gonna appeal to me there regarding talking about
the other side is going to be versions of the other side to get me fired up i'm going to keep
getting pejorative strawman versions of the other side and reinforcing versions of my side
which means that good faith endeavor to seek to understand is being broken right now because
that's what's being selected for on the facebook algorithm and that's where people are spending
time on site then the news agencies themselves have more incentive to make more salacious headlines
and shorter things that appeal to shorter attention spans and which means that they
can't possibly have complex or nuanced views because the complex nuanced views someone doesn't
have an attention span for yeah you can't run good sense making which also means you can't run
democracy with shorter attention spans you just can't right it it requires a larger bit size to
be able to understand something well enough to know what a good choice is and so the addiction of
new stimuli new stimuli i've been reading for five full seconds and i haven't got a new stimuli
that leads to the shortened attention span is itself fundamentally breaking down of the possibility
of participatory governance and so you get this feedback cycle right between what the algorithms
that are the digital environment which were consuming information about the world and the
producers of the content what their incentive is that will actually get paid attention to
and then the conditioning of the population and so we could intervene on any of those three
error error oh and then also the incentive of the politicians right so if a politician does
more salacious stuff that is automatically easier for the news to pick up that's also going to be
useful and so what we see is a set of reinforcement dynamics so then you're asking could we make a
politician who is charismatic enough but where the charisma is bound to good thinking we could ask
could we make news that tries to bind affected limbic hijacks to good thinking you can ask could
we change the social media algorithms in such a way that are still sticky but walking people in
the right direction and then at the end of it you could say could we educate the populace
to be more aware of how much the world is seeking to hijack their attention and that there is
feel good about any of those i feel good about a strategy that's working on all of them simultaneously
and i feel particularly good about the last one that i'm mentioning right now would it would it
would it not be perhaps easier if it was a malignant thing like might we be able to solve
the problem more directly if it were more malignant that's the thing that scares me
is that the technium actually is take playing a role here that that's just frightening to a
certain extent i mean i want to believe don't don't get me wrong like i i i have a predisposition
towards optimism but i don't know like even the first one though like we're talking because we're
talking about a certain kind of charisma which i'll give you an example so today
i watched chris haze and and uh what's her name uh rachel madow just laughing so hard about the
jeffrey tubin thing and like doing this kind of bow thing together with each other on the news
and i looked at it and i'm immature so i'm not judging them as humans but i am judging our news
like they were having more fun with jeffrey tubin and masturbation than just about anything
they could have had in a long time and i looked at them like this is like the world we live in
right now like there's no way cronkite was doing that and there's something to that that by the way
from a business perspective apparently doesn't work very well because if it did there'd be people
doing it but from a cultural perspective it scares the hell out of me when you say would it be easier
if it was more malignant um the thing the the deepest underlying things that are driving the
problems in the world are not a clear bad guy it's not nazis um people want to focus on uh
a clear bad guy and so they actually over norm things to that but why political left right
polarization moved in the direction it has or why a facebook why tiktok became more sticky than
facebook did because of an incentive war that even if you change one platform there's other
platforms emerging um the the underlying dynamics are the are are kind of like an invisible hand
themselves and they're a bunch of hyperobjects hyperobjects uh is an important concept which is
we evolved to perceive things with our senses and to be able to
look at hear touch taste and ground to understand something to know how to respond to it because in
our evolutionary environment we were mostly responding to things like that were either direct
threats or direct opportunities that our senses could work with it's impossible to directly sense
climate change it's not something that you can sense i i can see snow melting somewhere but i
could always see snow melting i have to try to take statistics on snow melt year over year and ice
taps and things about co2 that i can't see that are invisible in the atmosphere so i can conceptualize
it but i can't sense it to have it feel viscerally real to me i can't sense the social media algorithms
i can't sense the the principles of narrative warfare or class dynamics or um any of those types
of things i can't sense arms races i can see there's a groan but i can't see all of the
drones and the arms races towards ai weapon that conceptualize it but it's very hard for us to
conceptualize a hyperobject emotionally as well as it is a real object particularly an agent
because the bad guy historically mostly looked like an agent that wanted to come attack us right
and so oh it's nazis it's terrorists it's republicans it's democrats it's you know whoever it is the
bad guy is great we're we're pretty good at that when we have problems that are hyperobjects that
are the result of collective behavioral dispositions right climate change is not the result of
nazis or communists or or republicans or democrats right it's the result of collective
behavioral dispositions it's very hard to make that the bad guy in a clear enough way that will
motivate different tribes that are against each other unifying against them and so the kind of
enemy hypothesis where people will orient to be more tribal and they'll only unify if they have
a shared enemy it's very hard to make the hyperobjects that really are the shared enemy of
everyone the felt shared enemy because evolutionary we're not that wired that way so it's much easier
to keep making each other enemies but when you keep making each other enemies where you have
increasing narrative weapons right the ability to put fake or at least spawn or conspiratorial
or whatever it is info out and spread it to billions of people and make it highly viral and
split test what makes it most viral when you have when you have also then decentralized real weapons
that are more catastrophic cyber weapons drone weapons whatever what happens when you keep running
conflict energy from of humans towards other humans with increasingly decentralized increasingly
catastrophic capability it good it goes bad right so we do have to figure out how to deal with that
thing let's get to that one second let me daniel let me try to i was thinking this morning about
can we channel the nationalist zeal that america has against china it is something that's actually
great for the growth of america like could we look at how china does long-range planning
and look at how they put their best and brightest into some of those long-range plans obviously
they have all sorts of other advantages we don't have so far as former government and use that as
a way to redesign aspects of america i asked that because i'm i'm i'm asked that in reflection
to what you guys are just describing about hyperobjects if can we use things like that can
we use things that stir us up as a people to motivate us to incentivize us towards positive
directions overall can we find things so punchline being how do we incentivize
people to pay attention to things that can't be sensed directly yeah so you have a couple
different answers the the only enduring and effective answer that i know is much deeper
and wider education so that's more people understand the hyperobjects well enough and
can actually make choices from executive function that they're not just needing an enemy hypothesis
that they viscerally feel outside of that any solution i can give where i'm saying okay here's
how i manipulate the populist that don't understand stuff there will always be a that's a that drives
armed races whenever i'm doing war you always get armed races you never get to create a weapon and
not have a counter weapon from some group they want something else where they learn what was
effective about your weapon iterate on it so it's kind of like and i think this is something that
i've seen the political left recently in the us be particularly not cognizant of so if you
use shame as a social tool called people racist and islamic phobics and transphobics and whatever
to kind of like um shame them into a particular kind of uh political view or political correctness
that shame as a weapon as a narrative weapon creates a counter weapon and the counter weapon is
not giving a shit about those titles at all that's one of the counter weapons right so at a
certain point it's like oh that just stops working call me a racist fuck off and um another one of
the counter weapons is if okay let's let's have to the degree that academia and left establishment
started to have some alignment more than we can say was fully unbiasedly warranted and so there was a
people on the political right feeling like there were academic arguments they couldn't argue
that didn't feel true to them or that didn't feel like it took their concerns to mind well so this
would be things like social sciences critical race theory whatever it is or some of the
environmental sciences that didn't that addressed and even whether they're wrong or whether they're
just partial but all didn't also partially address the things that other people had lived experience
of anti-intellectualism becomes a counter weapon to weaponize academia where they're like i trust
my gut and i'm i'm sticking with the bible or i trust my gut and i'm sticking with trump or whatever
it is um so it's always important to think about if we're not talking about really educating people
where they can think well about what's true and we're talking about well okay they're they're too
dumb to do that so how do we effectively use some kind of narrative control mechanisms on them other
groups will also be doing that to the degree that that's effective and then you have to deal with
the escalation the arms race of narrative warfare with exponentiating narrative warfare technology
now start to see what happens when they're putting on the vr headsets and being in these environments
and on and on some of so we've done a pretty good job probably describing some of the challenge set
in which we find ourselves in this civilization in this brain inside this media environment
and when i jumped in before that last question you were beginning to talk about some of the
modern day risks or consequences so i'm i'm trying to show a chapter separation here for our listeners
of you know what what i think we were to sort or learned about before is part of how hard it is to
come to solutions being who we are and where we are but i'd love to hear a little more from you
about why it matters that we deal with solutions well now and one quote that i heard you say i thought
was was quite illuminating was we're running through a forest increasingly fast and increasingly
blind right so what are these trees we may run into what are the risks what are the higher
consequence challenges that are in front of us right now that we may not be aware of
i don't i don't know that it's terribly useful for most people to study existential and catastrophic
risk well if they don't feel like they have some agency connected being able to make things better
because it just can stress them out and sometimes even make them nihilistic where they don't engage
the agency they could have and i i'm going to interrupt you and i i did i tell you the story
about and there is he's walked in about my 11 year old then nine year old when i was writing
warnings and the chapter on on the the control function artificial intelligence and one of the
parents of one of his friends called me up and was like what are you teaching your kids at home
because you've terrified one of my children so i agree we uh evolution selected for all animals
including us for sensory mechanisms information processing to process that sense information
and then actuator output to act on it in a closed loop right um if i could sense something but i
couldn't make sense of it there'd be no evolutionary adaptive value to that and it wouldn't have been
selected for if i could make sense of it but i couldn't act on it or if i could act in a way
that wasn't informed by sensing the environment none of those would be adaptive so what's selected
for is the closed loop between those technologies kind of broken that loop open for humans where
i can sense things that i'm not directly sensing through the internet news i can hear what's happening
in dc or portland or bangladesh or whatever but i can't actually make sense of is that true is
it the whole truth what's going on because i'm getting very partial sensing and on things too
complex so my i can sense stuff but not make sense of it to the degree i feel like i can make sense
of something large-scale things like climate change or whatever i don't feel like i can act on
because i don't have the agency like what do i do about that and to the degree that i can that i am
acting on things i'm acting through largely decentralized distributed process i'm buying
something that had supply chains that took six continents and all kinds of activity to make
the thing happen so i'm having effects right my action is actually through supply chains having
a globalized effect but i can't sense it so i can't really make appropriate choices and as a
result as a result the the binding of sense making an agency is very broken and i want to
rebind those because if someone is hearing about problems that they feel like they can't do anything
about oftentimes there's just overwhelm and shut down let's go to entertainment or whatever it is
or sometimes even worse is something like nihilism sets it and so i can talk about what are some of
the catastrophic risks but the context i'm trying to set first is i think for most people
them being more aware of their local news what's really going on and how they can help out with the
animal shelter the pta the integrity of local governments the things where they feel like
they actually have some agency to do it they should invest more of their sense making in
places where they can do something about it because they'll actually then do positive things
and they will increase their sense of agency which will then allow them to start sensing
larger things and being able to take steps with it well i i sign up to that but at the same time you
and others and i to maybe some extent have to make sure we are really looking at these existential
risks as well and i think that's probably a pretty wise direction for this conversation where you're
going where we find ourselves with this challenge of incentivizing accurate information disincentivizing
false information i'm using your words can make a request i would like you guys just quickly just
name five i mean i'm sitting here like i wonder what the fuck these guys think is existential
because i got my list so i'm guessing your list is better than mine and there and others so just
give us five something to think about don't want to take too much right daniel you start with number
one so some people categorize it by like uh exponential technologies who's can't you're
doing two you have to do one i don't have a taxonomy that i would wait that way and so i was going to
do a meta comment on maybe you want to share your top five and then i will make some comments on that
i don't know my top five i would say i mean we kind of covered it pretty well but i would probably
start with the control function on superintelligence um i would then probably talk about and of course
this gets to your concept about about self-recursive technologies i would then get to um uh crisper
castinine and gene editing and then i would probably get to and obviously the use for that
in biological weapons um i think there's i mean i think there's a societal disruption
probably coming from sudden global uh sudden global sea level rise i don't think i put it
as high up at my list and i feel like i'm kind of missing something that we were talking about
earlier which is about just the dissolution of society it's not existential but so the
dissolution of society the end of pox americana the end of the ability for america to offer any
sort of goodness to global world order that the taking over that mantle by a country that
has shown great disregard for human rights which is china i i don't find that's obviously not
existential but i think that's a category risk so i don't know there's my quick shot so so what's
not on your list is war not for existential so yeah that's cool but by the way tom i think
that's a good one too by the way it's a good one too i think that i think the the risk of um global
nuclear winner from even a much smaller nuclear exchange than the one that we thought about in
the cold war like a north kray us exchange or an india pakistan exchange as described by dr allen
robach is a very serious risk as well and that's a gigadeth risk not an existential risk meaning
millions and billions of people would die but perhaps not the end of civilization
but cheery so yeah if we define existential as the end of all sapiens and there's even worse
forms of the end of all mammals or all hydrocarbon life on earth or something like that um there are
not that many scenarios that take us there uh and but if we talk about catastrophic risk of losing
the improvements of quality of life that have been happening and losing a huge amount of the
collective knowledge and wisdom and industrial capacity and like that as well as a tremendous
amount of life there's quite a lot more scenarios where that happens um and i know rp you've had
nick bostrom come speak in group before everybody should study boscow's work if they want to have
a good insight into existential risk um reading uval harari's second book yep global catastrophic risks
is a good slightly easier intro to the topic um so i'll talk about catastrophic
non existential risk that i'm particularly more concerned by is something that involves
cascades between a bunch of different categories where none of them on their own if you're just
modeling if i'm just modeling nuclear risk or just modeling climate change or just poverty by itself
i don't get this but if i start to look at climate change not as something that makes a
venusified uninhabitable planet but something that makes increasing droughts that destroy crops and
going along with decreasing groundwater start to create massive unlivable areas in india and
vangladesh and various places like that that lead to human migration and very large human
migration that then leads to resource pressures and resource wars that then lead to war escalation
on existing political fault lines that can then lead to increasing participation on multiple
sides of that and more scaled war that can lead to breakdowns of critical infrastructure and
supply chains now you nationalist government structures so you know i think that uh you know
like with with covid and covid was just a big enough catastrophe to start setting off a bunch of
the systemic fragilities um i'll just i'll share one way of thinking about this the idea of human
induced real catastrophic risk wasn't even a reasonable idea until world war two in the bomb
because we didn't have technology big enough to mess everything up we just weren't that powerful
and then and so the major empires always warred throughout all of history like we don't have
any real knowledge of how to be at peace with each other um historically for very long periods of
time only for relatively short periods and so now all of a sudden with the nuclear bomb and the
consequence of it the major empires aren't allowed to war with each other anymore and so we got this
Bretton Woods global globalization world that said okay let's be so economically interdependent
on each other that it is and focus on massive GDP growth for the whole world that everyone gets to
be part of a positive sum game and we don't need to kill each other over who gets the scarce resource
because it's not zero sum people growing total GDP through globalization extraction so fast and
we're so dependent on each other bombing each other's a bad idea and that gave us a relatively
long period of at least the major empires not actually doing kinetic war they did cold war
and they did proxy war and there was an insurgency wars and i would say that that world that Bretton
Woods set of agreements is largely broken down and is in final stages of breaking down and what
replaces it is a really big question here but since then we went from you know call it two superpowers
with nukes to a lot more countries with nukes but also a lot more total types of catastrophe weapons
as we're talking about cyber weapons can be catastrophe weapons now by taking out infrastructure
and drone weapons are easy and unlike nukes that take nation state level capacity because
uranium enrichment is hard drone weapons don't take nation state level so non-state actors can
have them which means you can't do mutually assured destruction so mutually assured destruction
only worked when you had two superpowers one catastrophe weapon now you've got dozens of
catastrophe weapons and many dozens of actors that haven't and you can't keep up the same gdp
globalization growth because we're hitting limits of growth in terms of fundamental resources and
you know biosphere issues okay so now what do we do here so the globalization that that Bretton
Woods world caused also caused a lot of fragility because what it meant was the world was so
interconnected that if things broke down in one area you could start getting cascading breakdowns
because of supply chains and so the world got to see oh wow we're very dependent on China for
production of lots of things so what happens if a breakdown occurs in China right so one of the
things that I saw covid did and covid is nowhere near as bad as the pandemics that could happen
following in terms of virality or lethality so it was kind of like just bad enough to show us
how much we're not prepared for catastrophic risk pandemics or anything um which hopefully we take
the lesson of right now we have not yet we have not started to increase effective global coordination
towards this which is why sense making this is critical but um okay so covid's an issue so
we're going to shut down travel to stop the movement of the virus well in doing that we
also shut down critical supply chains that included things like fertilizers and pesticides that were
necessary for the way that agriculture works in many areas of the world to increase food insecurity
and increase poverty type dynamics and this is what I mean by the way we solve problems causes
additional or worse problems we think too myopically if we're trying to solve this but not what will
the unintended consequence of this in a very very connected and increasingly fragile world be so
the food insecurity in Nigeria of 26 million people who were food insecure who are now way
more food insecure which means Boko Haram rises and things like that got way worse and in India
we've got a few hundred million people in relatively serious food insecurity on top of climate change
already making hotter drier summers and an erosion of groundwater so now in the next few summers where
you can have massive die off of crop as a result of the heat so then you know when it's 52 Celsius
in the heat waves and there's no food and water people don't die peacefully does that work over
resource cleave along muslim hindu lines if it does does it become an india pakistan war like
this is where you start getting to see the ability for just the normal stuff that is happening
to start to really cascade and it doesn't take a big thing to turn into a big thing it can take a
little thing and the set of cascades in a very fragile environment to turn into a very big thing
yeah the um the um two quick thoughts so one is not to disagree with anything you said because I
agree with that entirely and this might seem flippant but I do have this thought that if
cv19 was a little more lethal or killed younger people we would have taken it more seriously and
it would have ultimately killed less people but your point about how it's kind of laid bare the
fragility of our infrastructure the just in time world we live in is absolutely real and to put a
very harsh point on that the world food program says it was actually a few months ago they said it
I think things are getting worse that 265 million people may starve in the next uh 24 months or less
because of the disruption caused by this you know relatively mild disease you know put differently
what's fascinating about this disease is that it's individually not that lethal but in a community
in a national level it's quite destructive um so I just wanted to have this for a minute
that's a quarter of a billion people right that was half of the entire population of the world
at the beginning of the industrial revolution like just to just have a sense of scale there
and then typically people don't just die peacefully if they see that other people have resources
and so then the question is can insurgencies that don't have comparable weapons cause problems
and I think we're all very clear now yes they definitely can and and and they can without
really good drones and crisper bioweapons but they especially
