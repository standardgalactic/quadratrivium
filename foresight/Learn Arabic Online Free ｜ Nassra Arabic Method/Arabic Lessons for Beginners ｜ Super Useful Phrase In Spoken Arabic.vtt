Hi guys, it's Omar speaking and today I will teach you a very important phrase in Arabic,

00:12.480 --> 00:18.720
especially if you are going to like you know to the Middle East or to Arabic country and

00:18.720 --> 00:24.880
you are learning Arabic but you are not really like that you know quite confident yet and you

00:24.880 --> 00:31.360
want to tell people that I only speak Arabic a little bit so they can actually slow down

00:31.360 --> 00:37.120
and you can understand them okay even here in London if you have Arabic friends and you wanted

00:37.120 --> 00:44.000
to speak with them Arabic and you want to tell them you know to slow down that you actually

00:44.000 --> 00:49.760
speak it with Arabic so they can slow down for you okay so the phrase is

00:55.840 --> 00:59.840
I speak Arabic a little bit

01:15.040 --> 01:20.800
the hitch is a throat letter so it's not soft one like in English so

01:25.680 --> 01:29.840
Arabic again here the iron is throat letter so

01:35.760 --> 01:43.280
a little bit is actually a phrase I mean like some some but the equivalent that

01:43.280 --> 01:49.520
in English is a little bit and actually we use it in different you know scenarios but for now

01:49.520 --> 01:55.280
just learn a little bit okay so one more time

02:01.840 --> 02:02.160
