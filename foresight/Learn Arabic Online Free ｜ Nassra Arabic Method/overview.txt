¡Hola Omar! You've provided a guide on how to politely communicate to Arabic speakers that you are still learning the language and would like them to speak slowly for better understanding. The key phrase in Arabic, which includes a throat letter (حمزة), is:

"أتذكر العربية قليلاً."

This translates to "I remember a little bit of Arabic," or more colloquially, "I only speak Arabic a little bit." The throat letter in this phrase is pronounced differently than the equivalent 'g' sound in English. Omar also emphasizes that the phrase "a little bit" can be used in various contexts but suggests starting with just learning this specific expression.

Omar invites viewers to subscribe to his channel, promising that every Friday, a winner will be chosen to receive full access to the "Nasr al-Arabic method," an online training program designed to master spoken Arabic. He encourages viewers to subscribe to benefit from this opportunity and to tune in for future videos.
