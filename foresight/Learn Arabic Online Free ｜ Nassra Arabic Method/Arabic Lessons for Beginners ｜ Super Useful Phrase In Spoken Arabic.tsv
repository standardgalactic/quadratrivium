12480	18720	especially if you are going to like you know to the Middle East or to Arabic country and
18720	24880	you are learning Arabic but you are not really like that you know quite confident yet and you
24880	31360	want to tell people that I only speak Arabic a little bit so they can actually slow down
31360	37120	and you can understand them okay even here in London if you have Arabic friends and you wanted
37120	44000	to speak with them Arabic and you want to tell them you know to slow down that you actually
44000	49760	speak it with Arabic so they can slow down for you okay so the phrase is
