0	8000	So what I'm going to do now is show you something beautiful, some beautiful mathematics.
8000	12000	We can't do much in physics or we can't start this discussion properly
12000	15000	as far as the gradients and Hamiltonians are concerned
15000	19000	if we don't understand the concept of the minimum.
19000	23000	Something is at a minimum and that is how nature decides what to do.
23000	27000	Nature decides that the shortest distance between two points
27000	30000	in a clean space is going to be a straight line.
30000	32000	How does it decide that?
32000	36000	There must be something underlying this decision in nature.
36000	41000	It's the concept of the minimum and you've got to understand it
41000	44000	through the concept of the calculus of variations.
44000	46000	So how do we do that?
46000	55000	There's going to be many boards and I'll have to wipe the board in between.
55000	57000	Let's just have a look at this.
57000	65000	I have the XY plane and I have two points which is a starting point
65000	71000	and a final point and there's various paths I can take through this.
71000	75000	So you could in space, there's my X and there's my Y.
75000	79000	I'm going to go from one point to the other point on some path.
79000	83000	You can imagine I can go to Andromeda Galaxy and back
83000	87000	and there will still be one path if Andromeda is there
87000	90000	at least if I could just go in a two dimensional plane.
90000	95000	There is many lines I can take between this
95000	99000	but I want the shortest possible distance between those two.
99000	102000	The shortest possible distance.
102000	107000	Now one way I can measure this, any of the paths
107000	113000	that I can possibly choose is just to divide it into tiny little segments
113000	118000	of say a specific length delta S.
118000	122000	So let's blow that up a little bit.
122000	128000	If I were to blow that up it's almost going to be a straight line.
128000	139000	Most lecturers would skip this but then go straight to the integral
139000	143000	but this is good so this is going to be this arc length.
143000	147000	It has a length but it will have from that point to that point
147000	150000	a delta Y and a delta X.
150000	155000	So the length of delta S is very nearly going to be what?
155000	159000	Well the square root of that per se, this is Pythagorean theorem.
159000	165000	So that will be delta X squared plus delta Y squared.
165000	172000	Very beautiful and we know if I can let delta X approach
172000	176000	the limit take the limit as this approaches zero,
176000	180000	this is going to become smaller, this line segment will become shorter
180000	187000	and right in the end I'm going to have this differential tiny little distance dS
187000	193000	which is going to be the square root of dx squared plus dy squared.
193000	199000	We can all see that and I can rewrite this.
199000	202000	Just want to show you how nice you can rewrite it of course.
202000	207000	You're going to say dS is going to equal the square root of,
207000	216000	I can take a dx squared out which will leave me one plus dy squared over dx squared.
216000	218000	It's beautiful.
218000	221000	I've just taken this out as a common factor.
221000	225000	If I were to multiply this back in there of course I'm going to line it back up there.
225000	231000	In other words dS I can write as the square root of one plus,
231000	236000	let's just call it Y prime, Y with respect to x squared
236000	239000	and that's very ugly, I should do that.
239000	244000	You can see as the whole it's dy squared and dx squared.
244000	248000	So that and I'm just calling it Y prime dx.
248000	249000	That's what I'm doing.
249000	254000	So that will be the length of an infinitesimally small little line segment there.
254000	261000	I've zoomed in so much that it actually is a straight line so I go from approximate to absolutely equal to
261000	264000	and that is in the limit as delta X goes to zero.
264000	266000	And what can I do?
266000	270000	How do we do integration if I have to just sum all of these together?
270000	272000	I take the integral of that.
272000	276000	So if I were to take the integral of both sides, what am I left with?
276000	282000	S, the total distance of this arc, so this is just a line integral,
282000	289000	is going to be this definite integral and going from x1 to x1 to x2
289000	296000	of the square root of 1 plus Y prime squared dx.
296000	299000	So there's my line integral.
299000	305000	And this is setting up distance, but this needn't be distance.
305000	308000	I can set up many things in physics.
308000	311000	I might want to know what the shortest time is.
311000	316000	So there's going to be some path chosen that represents the shortest time.
316000	318000	I can have many things in here.
318000	326000	I can have not just distance but shape what would be the minimum surface area of something.
326000	332000	And I can do that by just setting up an equation for surface area.
332000	338000	So what we do in calculation of various calculations of variations is
338000	343000	we're just going to call this I, that is this group for not only length
343000	346000	but surface area, time, anything.
346000	351000	It's going to be something that I can now plot on a,
351000	353000	so there's needn't be distance and distance.
353000	355000	We can have something else.
355000	358000	But it's going to go from some initial point which I'll call x sub 1
358000	361000	and some final point which I'll call x sub 2.
361000	366000	Just to refer to the fact that there's something on one of the axes
366000	370000	of some function and if I look at this function very carefully
370000	377000	it's actually a function of x, y and y prime with respect to that axis.
377000	380000	So it's from one point to another point on that axis.
380000	384000	So it's the f of x, y and y prime.
384000	388000	Now there's no x in there but that one might as well have been x to the power 0.
388000	392000	So there is and there's no y, just a normal y in there
392000	395000	but that might also have been y to the power 0.
395000	399000	In effect this is a distance one so there was no x and y in there
399000	401000	but there could be.
401000	403000	So there's a function of x, y and y prime.
403000	407000	So at any time we can set this up.
407000	410000	It's called a functional.
410000	413000	This is called a functional that I'm going to do something
413000	415000	and it's going to give me some scale of value.
415000	419000	And I'll clean the board and we're going to use this concept
419000	422000	to prove to you that in the Euclidean space,
422000	425000	and it's not some funny space, it's flat space,
425000	427000	that the shortest distance between that point and that point
427000	430000	is going to be a straight line, we're going to develop this
430000	434000	to prove that that is indeed so and through doing that
434000	437000	hopefully I'll show you that that is what nature does
437000	438000	and that's what we can do.
438000	441000	We're going to use the calculus of variation
441000	447000	to show that there is something in here that is a minimum distance
447000	451000	or a minimum time or a minimum surface area
451000	454000	and that is what nature chooses.
454000	456000	I'm going to clean the board and we'll carry on.
456000	458000	The board is clean, let's have a look.
458000	460000	So there we go.
460000	463000	Now imagine, I'm going to construct something.
463000	466000	So imagine I knew the answer.
466000	470000	The equation for that curve between the two points
470000	472000	which is the minimum.
472000	477000	Imagine I knew that and that solution was the y of x,
477000	480000	small y of x.
480000	482000	Now let's construct another function,
482000	484000	we'll call it capital y of x,
484000	488000	and that's going to include this small y of x
488000	491000	plus some constant multiple of a second function
491000	494000	called eta of x,
494000	497000	as most textbooks will do it this way.
497000	502000	And I'm going to pause the video here
502000	504000	and just insert another video I made
504000	510000	which is a screencast of how this is actually the absolute truth.
510000	513000	Before I do that I just want to make two things abundantly clear
513000	515000	and we're going to set this up.
515000	518000	This is like a magician setting up something specifically
518000	521000	so that it works out for him or her.
521000	523000	And we're going to set this situation up
523000	525000	so that it does work for us.
525000	528000	So this is my one point and my other point
528000	532000	and we all know intuitively this is going to end up being a straight line
532000	533000	but what if it isn't?
533000	536000	So I have this curve there
536000	539000	and right at this x sub 1
539000	542000	and right at this x sub 2
542000	544000	I'm going to choose another curve
544000	546000	and that's my curve,
546000	548000	eta of x
548000	551000	such that at these points x1 and x2
551000	554000	it has a y value of 0
554000	557000	and I can choose many of these
557000	560000	just by changing this constant multiple eta.
560000	562000	If eta is 1 this would be one curve
562000	564000	if eta is 1.5 it will be another curve
564000	567000	if eta is negative 3 this would be another curve
567000	571000	and this was my two answer which is a secret up till now
571000	573000	but imagine I knew what it was
573000	576000	and if I just add this at every point I just add these two
576000	578000	then I was going to have something like this
578000	582000	but you can imagine this capital Y of x
582000	587000	is just these two additives
587000	590000	but you imagine they are multiple
590000	592000	for every eta of x
592000	594000	I can choose any constant
594000	597000	which will give me an infinite number of these little curves
597000	600000	which means added to the real answer
600000	602000	I can get many others
602000	604000	and remember single variable
604000	606000	just normal variable calculus
606000	608000	if I just had a curve
608000	610000	if I had a curve
610000	614000	and I wanted to know the minimum of the maximum
614000	617000	well all these extreme points
617000	621000	extreme would be at spots where the derivative
621000	624000	the first derivative was going to be 0
624000	626000	that is a minimum or maximum
626000	628000	and I knew it was a minimum
628000	630000	if I took the second derivative
630000	632000	and if that answer was at that point was larger than 0
632000	634000	I knew that to be a minimum
634000	636000	and that's the same thing we're going to do to this
636000	638000	we want a minimum
638000	640000	the derivative of this
640000	642000	and set it equal to 0
642000	644000	remember this is how I set up my distance
644000	646000	I had s equals
646000	650000	a different integral from x1 to x2
650000	654000	of the square root of 1 plus y prime squared dx
654000	656000	that was my distance
656000	658000	I want to take the derivative of that
658000	660000	and I want to set it equal to 0
660000	662000	and if I do that
662000	664000	I'm going to get to the minimum point
664000	666000	and that's what we want
666000	670000	something that this line falls exactly on top of that line
670000	672000	because if I do that
672000	674000	there will be some minimum
674000	677000	and that will be the two result that I get there
677000	679000	I'm ahead of myself
679000	681000	so this is what we set up
681000	683000	I'm going to pause the video here
683000	685000	and insert that a little bit
685000	687000	just to show you that this is an actual fact
687000	689000	you can set this up
689000	691000	in many ways you can set this up
691000	695000	this is not some trickery here that is mathematically unsound
695000	697000	it's very sound
697000	699000	you can set this up and I'll show you in the video
699000	701000	so here we go
701000	703000	let me show you
703000	705000	I want to construct this capital Y of x
705000	707000	in terms of small y of x
707000	709000	plus some other function eta of x
709000	712000	and at eta of x I want to be able to multiply by some constant
712000	714000	so I've set some things up here
714000	716000	let's have a look at them
716000	719000	let's just take some of these away
719000	722000	and let's just bring them back
722000	724000	one by one
724000	726000	just that this is my y of x
726000	728000	I've made it a straight line
728000	730000	it needn't be a straight line
730000	732000	and here's my eta of x
732000	735000	and I'm just drawing in these two straight lines
735000	738000	just to note that I've constructed eta x
738000	741000	in this instance it is something here
741000	743000	there we go
743000	745000	there's my epsilon
745000	748000	which I've called in here
748000	750000	and it's this
750000	753000	minus x minus 4 squared plus 1
753000	756000	I'll show you now why I put the n in there
756000	758000	so what I'm saying is
758000	760000	one thing
760000	762000	I've got to construct this so that
762000	764000	at x1 and x2
764000	766000	which is this spot here
766000	768000	and that spot there
768000	770000	I want that to correspond
770000	772000	here to the same values
772000	774000	that's why I've got the two straight lines
774000	776000	and the fact that
776000	778000	the y value for eta of x
778000	780000	down here has got to be 0
780000	782000	and 0 at both points
782000	784000	that's the way I want to set this up
784000	786000	so what I have now
786000	788000	is the capital Y of x
788000	790000	and the capital Y of x
790000	792000	between x1 and x2
792000	794000	has got to be the addition of these two
794000	796000	and this is what we have right up here
796000	798000	this is this green
798000	800000	note though
800000	802000	that because eta of x is 0
802000	804000	at this point I'm not adding anything to
804000	806000	small y of x
806000	808000	and at that point I'm not adding anything to
808000	810000	small y of x
810000	812000	at these two curves
812000	814000	at every point on the x axis
814000	816000	between x1 and x2
816000	818000	if I added this value to that value
818000	820000	I was going to get that top value
820000	822000	that's what I'm saying
822000	824000	but look at this if I put eta in front of it
824000	826000	which here I've called n
826000	828000	it doesn't matter what size I make
828000	830000	eta
830000	832000	it's just some constant multiple
832000	834000	what epsilon I mean
834000	836000	my n here is epsilon
836000	838000	sorry for that
838000	840000	this value I make epsilon
840000	842000	it's a constant multiple
842000	844000	it is a constant multiple
844000	846000	of eta of x
846000	848000	and these points still
848000	850000	correspond to
850000	852000	my little y of x
852000	854000	and my little y of x there
854000	856000	so it doesn't matter
856000	858000	I now have this
858000	860000	almost well I can say
860000	862000	indefinite number of capital Y of x
862000	864000	every time that I change
864000	866000	epsilon
866000	868000	I'm going to have a different capital Y of x
868000	870000	look at the green curve
870000	872000	there are so many of them
872000	874000	look how many of them
874000	876000	there are
876000	878000	that means to get from
878000	880000	1.1
880000	882000	to .2
882000	884000	there are many many
884000	886000	paths that I can take
886000	888000	and I've got to find the
888000	890000	shortest one basically
890000	892000	that's why I'm setting up this problem
892000	894000	I want some minimum value
894000	896000	and the problem I'm going to deal with
896000	898000	obviously minimum arc length
898000	900000	between these two points
900000	902000	but just to show you
902000	904000	that I can construct
904000	906000	this capital Y of x
906000	908000	in the manner that I've done on the board
908000	910000	and it makes absolute sense
910000	912000	and you can just see it
912000	914000	beautifully in this illustration
916000	918000	good I hope you enjoyed that
918000	920000	now this is beautiful mathematics
920000	922000	stay with me you'll see where this is going
922000	924000	so what we're suggesting
924000	926000	and remember that was
926000	928000	my equation and I'm going to take the derivative
928000	930000	of that and set it equal to 0
930000	932000	that will give me the minimum value
932000	934000	that's all we're going to do
934000	936000	but I don't have this anymore
936000	938000	I've changed it
938000	940000	that refers to what I had in me
940000	942000	the real answer was going to come from that
942000	944000	was going to come from that
944000	946000	the real distance was going to have
946000	948000	some equation to it
948000	950000	some value to it
950000	952000	that in the actual fact that now
952000	954000	is a new function
954000	956000	in x capital Y
956000	958000	in capital Y prime
958000	960000	that is what I have now
960000	962000	so by constructing this addition
962000	964000	I've changed it from
964000	966000	x small y small y prime
966000	968000	to x large y y prime
968000	970000	so
970000	972000	some suggestion of this
972000	974000	will be remember that was
974000	976000	the square root of 1 plus y square
976000	978000	y prime squared
978000	980000	but if I do this to it
980000	982000	I'm going to have
982000	984000	this as my f of x
984000	986000	I have this
986000	988000	and I'm going to just do
988000	990000	some preliminary work
990000	992000	and you'll see shortly why I'm doing this preliminary work
992000	994000	if I
994000	996000	if I had this
996000	998000	function
998000	1000000	imagine let me just write it out
1000000	1002000	y of x
1002000	1004000	equals the y of x
1004000	1006000	plus
1006000	1008000	epsilon eta of x
1008000	1010000	what if I
1010000	1012000	were to take the derivative
1012000	1014000	of this with respect to this constant
1014000	1016000	can you take a derivative with respect
1016000	1018000	of constant of course you can because
1018000	1020000	what is 4
1020000	1022000	other than 4x to the power
1022000	1024000	0
1024000	1026000	if I were to take the derivative with respect
1026000	1028000	to x
1028000	1030000	I can still take the derivative here
1030000	1032000	with respect to x
1032000	1034000	that's probably not the best way
1034000	1036000	to explain it
1036000	1038000	let me rather do this
1038000	1040000	can I say
1040000	1042000	d y
1042000	1044000	capital Y of x
1044000	1046000	d epsilon
1046000	1048000	can I say that
1048000	1050000	now I don't necessarily want to do that
1050000	1052000	it's going to be a bit difficult
1052000	1054000	let's do the partial derivative
1058000	1060000	partial derivative with respect
1060000	1062000	to that constant
1062000	1064000	appear there
1064000	1066000	so that's going to equal 0
1066000	1068000	and
1068000	1070000	as I said I could have written this
1070000	1072000	with an x to the power 0
1072000	1074000	and what you can see this as
1074000	1076000	basically I suppose
1076000	1078000	is just the product of two functions
1078000	1080000	so I can take the derivative of this
1080000	1082000	times that
1082000	1084000	and this times the derivative of that
1084000	1086000	so I can actually have the
1086000	1088000	d epsilon
1088000	1090000	d epsilon
1090000	1092000	eta x
1092000	1094000	plus eta times
1094000	1096000	d
1096000	1098000	del
1098000	1100000	whichever way you want to pronounce it
1100000	1102000	of
1102000	1104000	eta x
1104000	1106000	so what are we going to have here
1106000	1108000	we're going to have the fact that
1108000	1110000	that's 0
1110000	1112000	that is 1
1112000	1114000	so we will
1114000	1116000	definitely have that
1116000	1118000	so that will be the eta of x
1118000	1120000	and there's no eta in there
1120000	1122000	so the partial derivative
1122000	1124000	of that with respect to epsilon
1124000	1126000	sorry is 0 0
1126000	1128000	times epsilon is 0
1128000	1130000	so the derivative of capital Y of x
1130000	1132000	with respect to epsilon is just
1132000	1134000	eta of x
1134000	1136000	let's take y prime
1136000	1138000	of x
1138000	1140000	well it's just going to be that
1140000	1142000	prime
1142000	1144000	and you can put the examples in here
1144000	1146000	and just show it to yourself
1146000	1148000	and what is going to happen here
1148000	1150000	well it's with respect to
1150000	1152000	x that I'm taking
1152000	1154000	that I'm taking this derivative
1154000	1156000	that is a function of x
1156000	1158000	so this is very easy this is going to be
1158000	1160000	epsilon eta prime
1160000	1162000	of x
1162000	1164000	in what way to happen if I took the
1164000	1166000	partial derivative of y prime
1166000	1168000	with respect to
1168000	1170000	epsilon
1170000	1172000	there's definitely a partial derivative
1172000	1174000	there's nothing in there that's going to be a 0
1174000	1176000	exactly the same thing has happened there
1176000	1178000	it's going to happen here
1178000	1180000	so we're just going to have eta prime of x
1180000	1182000	so that's all we're going to have
1182000	1184000	so these are the two equations
1184000	1186000	some preliminary work
1186000	1188000	I probably shouldn't have bought it in here
1188000	1190000	because you wonder why is he doing this
1190000	1192000	why is he doing this
1192000	1194000	let's clean the board and we'll carry on
1194000	1196000	let's carry on
1196000	1198000	now remember this thing
1198000	1200000	back I had my equation
1200000	1202000	which was this 1 plus y prime
1202000	1204000	square root of that
1204000	1206000	what were to happen if I
1206000	1208000	took the derivative of this
1208000	1210000	of this function
1210000	1212000	well I would have had to use the chain rule
1212000	1214000	so when I had the f of
1214000	1216000	x, y and y prime
1216000	1218000	I was going to have to use the chain rule
1218000	1220000	nothing changes if I have
1220000	1222000	this
1222000	1224000	if I have that function I'm also going to
1224000	1226000	have the chain rule
1226000	1228000	but because I have changed this
1228000	1230000	into that
1230000	1232000	I have a new
1232000	1234000	function i
1234000	1236000	which I now want to make a function
1236000	1238000	of epsilon
1238000	1240000	that is now going to be
1240000	1242000	x of 1 to x of 2
1242000	1244000	of the f of x
1244000	1246000	capital Y
1246000	1248000	capital Y prime dx
1248000	1250000	I have now changed
1250000	1252000	when I went from
1252000	1254000	my previous solution to this solution
1254000	1256000	I have now made this
1256000	1258000	a function of
1258000	1260000	eta because I could get
1260000	1262000	many y of x's
1262000	1264000	by simply just
1264000	1266000	changing this constant
1266000	1268000	so this now becomes a constant
1268000	1270000	of this function
1270000	1272000	and if I wanted to take the derivative
1272000	1274000	of this
1274000	1276000	if I wanted to take the derivative
1276000	1278000	of this with respect to
1278000	1280000	epsilon
1280000	1282000	why did I say eta all the time
1282000	1284000	you know what I mean when I write this
1284000	1286000	when I write this with respect to
1286000	1288000	with respect to epsilon
1288000	1290000	what is going to happen
1290000	1292000	now that is why I chose things
1292000	1294000	very carefully I also want to
1294000	1296000	do it at a point
1296000	1298000	where epsilon equals
1298000	1300000	0 and that's why I set things up
1300000	1302000	so remember when I showed you
1302000	1304000	on the screencast
1304000	1306000	that's why I chose things one of the reasons
1306000	1308000	and there's another reason there's sales
1308000	1310000	I wanted to because of that equals
1310000	1312000	0 then
1312000	1314000	my large y of x
1314000	1316000	this one will be exactly equal
1316000	1318000	to this one they'll fall on top of each other
1318000	1320000	and I'll have my solution
1320000	1322000	and another thing is
1322000	1324000	remember when I took the derivative
1324000	1326000	when f hat is 0
1326000	1328000	I have a minimum
1328000	1330000	so this is the secret
1330000	1332000	to this whole thing I'm going to take the derivative
1332000	1334000	so I've changed it to a function of eta
1334000	1336000	I'm going to take the derivative
1336000	1338000	with respect to eta exactly where eta
1338000	1340000	is 0
1340000	1342000	and if I set it equal to 0
1342000	1344000	that is the calculation
1344000	1346000	the calculus of variations
1346000	1348000	now just as we had
1348000	1350000	here I would have had to use the chain rule
1350000	1352000	let's use the chain rule
1352000	1354000	of this because if I
1354000	1356000	take the derivative of this
1356000	1358000	it's actually this
1358000	1360000	if I take the derivative of
1360000	1362000	I with respect to eta
1362000	1364000	it's the same as doing my integral
1364000	1366000	and taking the derivative of this inside
1366000	1368000	remember your first year calculus
1368000	1370000	so what we're saying here
1370000	1372000	they're just going to equal
1372000	1374000	the different integral going from this to that
1374000	1376000	and I'll have to apply the chain rule
1376000	1378000	so I'm actually going to have
1378000	1380000	d i f
1380000	1382000	d i small
1382000	1384000	let's do that
1384000	1386000	d i f d i capital Y times
1386000	1388000	del Y
1388000	1390000	del
1390000	1392000	epsilon plus
1392000	1394000	we must not make a mistake here
1394000	1396000	and I'm going to have f with respect to
1396000	1398000	y prime times
1398000	1400000	y prime
1400000	1402000	over epsilon
1402000	1404000	all of that
1404000	1406000	dx
1406000	1408000	so don't get confused here this is just the chain rule
1408000	1410000	of a function
1410000	1412000	of any function
1412000	1414000	remember if you were to take the chain rule
1414000	1416000	of something if you would take the first derivative
1416000	1418000	of something as simple as this
1418000	1420000	it would be very easy to do
1420000	1422000	this was going to be to the power half
1422000	1424000	you bring the half forward
1424000	1426000	and that becomes negative of half
1426000	1428000	the derivative of the inside function as well
1428000	1430000	which is going to be 2y prime
1430000	1432000	so it's easy to do
1432000	1434000	for any function f of x y
1434000	1436000	and y prime
1436000	1438000	I was going to use the chain rule
1438000	1440000	so yeah I'm also going to use the chain rule
1440000	1442000	nothing different and that's exactly
1442000	1444000	what I have there
1444000	1446000	and remember just the board before
1446000	1448000	I did this
1448000	1450000	and I did this so I know
1450000	1452000	what this is this was
1452000	1454000	remember what this was
1454000	1456000	or that was this
1456000	1458000	eta of x
1458000	1460000	remember that
1460000	1462000	rewind and you'll see and what was this
1462000	1464000	it was
1464000	1466000	eta prime of x
1466000	1468000	okay
1468000	1470000	so that works for me
1470000	1472000	and this has got to equal 0
1474000	1476000	because if I set it equal to 0
1476000	1478000	then I have a minimum
1478000	1480000	okay we know where it was
1480000	1482000	it's going to be an extreme
1482000	1484000	but let's call it a minimum for now
1484000	1486000	because that is exactly what it is
1486000	1488000	okay so we are there
1488000	1490000	what I want you to realize is one thing
1490000	1492000	I can do this
1492000	1494000	as integration by parts
1494000	1496000	remember the integration by parts
1496000	1498000	I just have to decide which one is u
1498000	1500000	and which one is v prime
1500000	1502000	and that's very easy to do
1502000	1504000	let's choose my v prime
1504000	1506000	equal to this
1506000	1508000	eta prime of x
1508000	1510000	that makes my v equal
1510000	1512000	to the prime eta of x
1512000	1514000	and if this was that
1514000	1516000	then that must mean
1516000	1518000	this one is u
1518000	1520000	by if
1520000	1522000	by capital Y prime
1522000	1524000	and that makes my u prime the d dx
1524000	1526000	of
1526000	1528000	by if
1528000	1530000	by y prime
1530000	1532000	now I can just simply do
1532000	1534000	integration by parts
1534000	1536000	remember that would be this times that
1536000	1538000	minus
1538000	1540000	the integral
1540000	1542000	of this one times that one
1542000	1544000	remember integration by parts
1544000	1546000	but I want to show you something
1546000	1548000	very specific here as well
1548000	1550000	and that's why I set things up
1550000	1552000	I was a magician and I set things up that they were
1552000	1554000	out specifically for me
1554000	1556000	I said I want to do this
1556000	1558000	around a point where eta equals 0
1558000	1560000	and what's going to happen
1560000	1562000	when eta equals 0
1562000	1564000	when eta equals 0
1564000	1566000	capital Y of x
1566000	1568000	and small y of x are going to be
1568000	1570000	exactly the same thing
1570000	1572000	they're going to be exactly the same thing
1572000	1574000	so what we're going to have
1574000	1576000	is the following so remember when I have
1576000	1578000	the integral
1578000	1580000	of the sum of two functions
1580000	1582000	I can just do them separately
1582000	1584000	so here I'm going to have
1584000	1586000	x sub 1 to x sub 2
1586000	1588000	of del f
1588000	1590000	del y
1590000	1592000	I'm making it a small y now because I'm setting
1592000	1594000	things up way epsilon equals
1594000	1596000	0 so then I will have
1596000	1598000	capital and lowercase
1598000	1600000	y of x is being exactly
1600000	1602000	the same times the eta
1602000	1604000	of x
1604000	1606000	del x
1606000	1608000	now for this side
1608000	1610000	I'm going to do this integration by parts
1610000	1612000	so it's u times v so it's d
1612000	1614000	these two so it's del f
1614000	1616000	del y prime times
1616000	1618000	eta
1618000	1620000	of x
1620000	1622000	from x sub 1 to x sub 2
1622000	1624000	minus
1624000	1626000	the integral of
1626000	1628000	going from x sub 1 to x sub 2
1628000	1630000	of these two
1630000	1632000	so it's
1632000	1634000	d dx of
1634000	1636000	del f
1636000	1638000	del y prime
1638000	1640000	eta
1640000	1642000	what was that
1642000	1644000	eta of x
1644000	1646000	dx and that's going to equal 0
1646000	1648000	I hope you can still see that
1648000	1650000	now remember also when I did here
1650000	1652000	I let these two
1652000	1654000	points be exactly the same
1654000	1656000	so if I were to plug
1656000	1658000	those into there
1658000	1660000	I was going to get 0
1660000	1662000	so this whole turn disappears
1662000	1664000	this whole turn disappears
1664000	1666000	and what am I left with
1666000	1668000	this integral
1668000	1670000	minus this integral
1670000	1672000	is going to equal 0 I can put them all together
1672000	1674000	in the same integral because this is
1674000	1676000	the difference between two functions
1676000	1678000	and I can take
1678000	1680000	these two out
1680000	1682000	is a common factor
1682000	1684000	and what am I going to be left with
1684000	1686000	going from x sub 1 to x sub 2
1686000	1688000	of what
1688000	1690000	well we're going to have
1690000	1692000	del f del y
1692000	1694000	minus
1694000	1696000	the dx of
1696000	1698000	del f
1698000	1700000	del y prime
1700000	1702000	all of that times
1702000	1704000	the eta of x
1704000	1706000	all of that dx is going to equal
1706000	1708000	0
1708000	1710000	and that low and behold
1710000	1712000	is the way we were trying to get this
1712000	1714000	is a thing of beauty
1714000	1716000	now I want to set this up
1716000	1718000	for any
1718000	1720000	eta of x
1720000	1722000	any eta of x
1722000	1724000	because for a different integral
1724000	1726000	to equal 0 that means this
1726000	1728000	inner part
1728000	1730000	this integrand has got to be 0
1730000	1732000	but I want it to be for any
1732000	1734000	function of 0 so
1734000	1736000	arbitrary function of eta
1736000	1738000	and so if that can't be 0
1738000	1740000	it's being multiplied by this
1740000	1742000	this has got to equal 0
1742000	1744000	and that
1744000	1746000	is the Euler
1746000	1748000	Lagrange function
1748000	1750000	and it states the following
1750000	1752000	that del f
1752000	1754000	del y
1754000	1756000	minus
1756000	1758000	the dx
1758000	1760000	of del f
1760000	1762000	del y prime
1764000	1766000	equals 0
1768000	1770000	there we are
1770000	1772000	that is the thing of beauty
1772000	1774000	and remember when my f was this
1776000	1778000	this was my f of xy and y prime
1780000	1782000	if I were to take the derivative
1782000	1784000	of this with respect to y
1784000	1786000	and I took the derivative
1786000	1788000	of this with respect to y prime
1788000	1790000	and then the derivative
1790000	1792000	of that
1792000	1794000	equal to 0 I was going to get
1794000	1796000	the answer
1796000	1798000	for the shortest distance between those two points
1798000	1800000	but I generalised it as I
1800000	1802000	so it might be the shortest time
1802000	1804000	it might be the shortest surface area
1804000	1806000	I can use the Euler Lagrange equation
1808000	1810000	to set up many physical
1810000	1812000	problems
1812000	1814000	if I can just through my physical problem
1814000	1816000	develop this
1816000	1818000	and we'll look at examples
1818000	1820000	in the next video I might just show you
1820000	1822000	how this distance between two points is a straight line
1822000	1824000	by solving
1824000	1826000	this Euler Lagrange
1826000	1828000	but this Euler Lagrange equation
1828000	1830000	right here is absolutely a
1830000	1832000	thing of beauty
1832000	1834000	and we set it up right from here
1834000	1836000	right from the start
1836000	1838000	we use the simple fact that the first derivative
1838000	1840000	if you set it to 0 you are going to get an extreme point
1840000	1842000	and that extreme point
1842000	1844000	is going to be a minimum
1844000	1846000	value for you
1846000	1848000	it's going to work out in this instance to be a minimum
1848000	1850000	instead of an extreme point
1850000	1852000	and you're going to land up
1852000	1854000	with this
1854000	1856000	this is a real
1856000	1858000	true a thing of mathematical
1858000	1860000	beauty
1860000	1862000	now
1862000	1864000	let me prove to you that the
1864000	1866000	shortest distance between two points on the Euclidean surface
1866000	1868000	is just a straight line
1868000	1870000	nature will always choose
1870000	1872000	a straight line
1872000	1874000	so you'll remember my equation for
1874000	1876000	using integration a line integral
1876000	1878000	for the length of
1878000	1880000	any arc
1880000	1882000	is that
1882000	1884000	this is my Euler Lagrange equation
1884000	1886000	so let's just do that
1886000	1888000	this is my F
1888000	1890000	this is my function F
1890000	1892000	function of x, y and y prime
1892000	1894000	let's get
1894000	1896000	iF times y
1896000	1898000	what is that going to equal
1898000	1900000	of this this bit well
1900000	1902000	there's no y in there so this is going to be 0
1902000	1904000	that was a simple one
1904000	1906000	y prime
1906000	1908000	well there's a y prime in there
1908000	1910000	so I better do this properly and I've got to do it
1910000	1912000	we said it before
1912000	1914000	I've got to do it
1914000	1916000	by
1916000	1918000	the following method
1918000	1920000	so what is that going to be
1920000	1922000	I'm going to bring the half forward so that was going to be a half
1922000	1924000	times
1924000	1926000	again we
1926000	1928000	we're still going to have this
1928000	1930000	squared to the power negative
1930000	1932000	for half and then I still have to multiply
1932000	1934000	by the inner
1934000	1936000	which is going to be 2 times y prime
1936000	1938000	that's really firstly a calculus
1938000	1940000	except that this is a partial derivative
1940000	1942000	but there is y prime in there
1942000	1944000	so these two are going to go
1944000	1946000	so what am I left with
1946000	1948000	I'm left with y prime over
1948000	1950000	the square root of 1 plus y prime
1950000	1952000	squared
1952000	1954000	that's what I'm left with
1954000	1956000	and so
1956000	1958000	they are left with 0 so I have
1958000	1960000	minus
1960000	1962000	dvx of
1962000	1964000	that which is now
1964000	1966000	just this
1966000	1968000	y prime over the
1968000	1970000	square root of 1 plus y prime
1970000	1972000	squared is going to equal
1972000	1974000	0
1974000	1976000	which I can multiply both sides
1976000	1978000	by negative 1 so this will disappear
1978000	1980000	simply
1980000	1982000	when is the derivative of
1982000	1984000	any function equal to 0
1984000	1986000	when that function is a constant
1986000	1988000	isn't it so all of this
1988000	1990000	is some constant
1990000	1992000	in other words
1992000	1994000	y prime equals
1994000	1996000	some constant times the square root of
1996000	1998000	1 plus y prime
1998000	2000000	squared
2000000	2002000	I can square both sides
2002000	2004000	if I square both sides
2004000	2006000	I get rid of this
2006000	2008000	and I square my constant
2008000	2010000	which leaves me with another constant
2010000	2012000	I can multiply this constant in there
2012000	2014000	so I'm going to see
2014000	2016000	some constant plus some constant
2016000	2018000	I can bring this over to one side
2018000	2020000	which means y prime
2020000	2022000	I can get on its own
2022000	2024000	which is then going to leave me
2024000	2026000	with 1 minus this
2026000	2028000	squared
2028000	2030000	remember I squared this now
2030000	2032000	to get rid of that
2032000	2034000	and that is going to
2034000	2036000	still equal some constant
2036000	2038000	I'm going to divide this into that side
2038000	2040000	which is giving me another constant
2040000	2042000	and in the end I'm going to
2042000	2044000	take the square root of that so y prime
2044000	2046000	is going to be some constant
2046000	2048000	just run through that
2048000	2050000	I'll be fishing
2050000	2052000	but just do it for yourself
2052000	2054000	you'll notice very quickly
2054000	2056000	that y prime
2056000	2058000	is equal to some constant
2058000	2060000	when is the derivative, how can a function of x
2060000	2062000	y prime of x
2062000	2064000	how can that be a constant
2064000	2066000	well the only way that that can be
2066000	2068000	is if the y of x
2068000	2070000	equals ax
2070000	2072000	plus b
2072000	2074000	if you take the derivative of that
2074000	2076000	that would come forward
2076000	2078000	so that's just my constant a
2078000	2080000	there's no x in there so that falls away
2080000	2082000	and what is that in the equation of
2082000	2084000	a straight line
2084000	2086000	proof that the shortest distance
2086000	2088000	between any two points in euclidean
2088000	2090000	two dimensional euclidean plane
2090000	2092000	is a straight line
2092000	2094000	how did I solve that
2094000	2096000	I set up my
2096000	2098000	differential
2098000	2100000	here
2100000	2102000	which is my
2102000	2104000	differential there
2104000	2106000	and I used the calculation of
2106000	2108000	the calculus of variations
2108000	2110000	to set up the Lagrange-Waley equation
2110000	2112000	I used the Lagrange-Waley equation
2112000	2114000	and I proved that the shortest distance is there
2114000	2116000	so if I set something else
2116000	2118000	of the any physical system
2118000	2120000	I'll have to set up this function f
2120000	2122000	and if I can set that function
2122000	2124000	of f with its time
2124000	2126000	with its surface area
2126000	2128000	I can use the Lagrange-Waley equation
2128000	2130000	to always give me the minimum
2130000	2132000	that is why I can set up a physical system
2132000	2134000	where I can look at time
2134000	2136000	what will be the shortest time
2136000	2138000	I can set up the surface area
2138000	2140000	and the most famous one of those
2140000	2142000	is if you have two rings
2142000	2144000	one smaller, one larger
2144000	2146000	and you put them in some of this
2146000	2148000	bubbly soapy water
2148000	2150000	and you bring them out and you'll separate them
2150000	2152000	and that will form a very specific
2152000	2154000	pattern between those two
2154000	2156000	soapy bubble circles
2156000	2158000	and there's a reason why you choose that
2158000	2160000	because that will give you the minimum surface area
2160000	2162000	that whole surface area
2162000	2164000	of the soapy fluid material
2164000	2166000	between these two
2166000	2168000	you've got to make that a minimum
2168000	2170000	and minimum and you can do it for volume as well
2170000	2172000	why is this one a volume
2172000	2174000	a sphere
2174000	2176000	in nature it does that because
2176000	2178000	it is a minimum
2178000	2180000	and some minimum is chosen
2180000	2182000	and lastly from that
2182000	2184000	who will come in this fact
2184000	2186000	a plane
2186000	2188000	that has to roll down
2188000	2190000	what is going to be the shortest time
2190000	2192000	for the ball to roll down
2192000	2194000	is it going to be a path that goes straight down
2194000	2196000	or is it going to be one of these
2196000	2198000	one of these paths
2198000	2200000	that is called the brachistochrome
2200000	2202000	problem
2202000	2204000	brachy which means short chrome
2204000	2206000	referring to time, shortest time
2206000	2208000	there's a reason why this ball
2208000	2210000	will roll down
2210000	2212000	will get from there to there faster
2212000	2214000	on the ball rolling down that path
2214000	2216000	there's a reason for that because nature
2216000	2218000	can choose the minimum time
2218000	2220000	that's what nature does, it wants to choose the minimum time
2220000	2222000	to get from there to there
2222000	2224000	and that is why it will choose a specific path
2224000	2226000	that will be the shortest path
2226000	2228000	to get down there
2228000	2230000	you just have to work out
2230000	2232000	an f of x
2232000	2234000	for this problem
2242000	2244000	you
