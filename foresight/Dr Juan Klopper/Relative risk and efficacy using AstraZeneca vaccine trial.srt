00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hi there, so this is a quite interesting video and I think it's very

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,800
topical. At the moment of course we get all these results from vaccine trials

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,920
and when you read these trials you'll see a lot of them expresses the

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,320
efficacy of the vaccine. Now in order for us to determine efficacy we look at the

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,040
relative risk. So this video I'm going to show you a notebook, two notebooks in

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,360
actual fact. I'm going to use R just to explain the language for

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,480
statistical computing just what relative risk is and how we then use it to

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,120
calculate efficacy and we're also going to look at a specific trial. In South

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,880
Africa there was a small trial as far as the AstraZeneca vaccine was concerned

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,440
and it showed very poor efficacy and because of that the vaccine was

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,280
withdrawn from South Africa which of course is a very big decision was the

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,960
first vaccine it was supposed to go to healthcare workers such as myself and

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,560
the vaccine was withdrawn because of the poor showing. So I'm going to show you

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,400
how they got to this very bad efficacy level of only 21% and of course

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,280
it's not only about that it's about this the confidence intervals around that

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,520
efficacy and that's what I want to explain. Now of course with drawing that

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,120
was a very difficult decision and it wasn't only the clinical data there was

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,520
some data as well and I'll talk a little bit about it about the neutralizing

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,880
antibodies etc a lot more went into the decision not to use the AstraZeneca

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,160
vaccine in South Africa. So it's all about relative risk and then this video

21
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,800
I'll show you just how a relative risk works how you can calculate it and how

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,880
from that we get the efficacy. So here we are on my art pub's website you can

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,920
view all the documents that I upload you can view them here and of course the

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,080
original the RMD files are available on GitHub and the links to all of these

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,720
things will be in the description down below. So we're just going to look at

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,240
uncertainty in relative risk. First what is risk what is relative risk and how do

27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,440
we express uncertainty in that and of course it's very topical with the

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,000
vaccines these days in the pandemic and we express the efficacy of these

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,040
vaccines. I want to show you just just how to do that. So in this first notebook

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,800
we're just going to talk about what risk is and what relative risk is and then

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,520
what efficacy is and then how can we express uncertainty just due to

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:19,320
randomness. We do one trial but there is a lot of other trials that if if we could

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,320
do it we could do it over and over and over again and this one trial that we

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,720
have is just one of the possible outcomes and we need to look at where the

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,880
actual efficacy lies and it'll be in some range that we can simulate around

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,680
this one this one study that we've done. So let's first have a look at what risk

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,320
is and you see there in equation one it's just a number of positive outcomes

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,240
divided by the total in the group. Now we've got to talk about what a positive

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,720
outcome is and we say positive outcome but it doesn't sentimentally have to be

40
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,600
positive. The outcome can be quite negative and in this instance it might

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,880
be well develop the disease and certainly that's not positive but we just

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,440
use this term that's the positive outcome that the outcome that we are

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,960
interested in and investigating. So if we have a bunch of participants in a

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,200
study a certain number of them will develop this positive outcome the

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,200
outcome that we're interested in as a set which might be quite a negative thing

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,200
but if we just take that ratio that fraction the number of positive outcomes

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,920
divided by the total number in the group that is the risk. Now if we've got two

48
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,360
groups one group for instance received a placebo intervention and one group

49
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,280
received a treatment intervention we can just look at this difference in the

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,240
risk between the two. So we'll calculate risk as per equation one for both of

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,560
them and we just take the difference so the risk in the control minus the risk

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,280
in the treatment and what we're assuming here is that the risk in the treatment

53
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,320
will be lower because the other name for risk difference is absolute risk

54
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,000
reduction ARR absolute risk reduction that's just the difference in the risk

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,880
and that's a very good way to express a difference in risk between a control

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,320
group receiving the placebo and the treatment group getting this active

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,200
intervention. So just that difference you've just got to just watch out if the

58
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,560
risk in the treatment ends up being higher than the risk in the control of

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
course then we cannot talk about absolute risk reduction or we still can't talk

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,560
about absolute risk reduction we just got to say that being in the placebo

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,160
group gives us a reduction in risk for this positive outcome that we're

62
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,920
talking about. You see there the number needed to treat that is just an equation

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,120
three there we're not going to discuss it I've just put that in for you so what

64
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,600
we really want to do is talk about relative risk. You'll see ARR risk ratio

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,520
relative risk that is the fraction of the risk of the intervention over the

66
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,760
risk of the control so we worked out the risk in both groups very simple

67
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,520
calculations the positive divided by the total the positive divided by the total

68
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,280
and for these two we'll just we'll just take the ratio. Now what we're hoping

69
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,480
for you of course is that the risk the positive outcomes that fraction will be

70
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,320
lower in the intervention or the treatment group than in the control group

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,560
and if that is so this fraction of course will be less than one and if it's

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,640
less than one it means the risk is lowered by being in the intervention or

73
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,000
treatment group. So that's when we express this idea of efficacy so let's

74
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,680
imagine here in this piecewise defined function on the top row here for

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,200
efficacy that the risk in the treatment group is lower than the risk in the

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,240
control group that it was good to develop this because fewer people

77
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,640
fraction wise for the individual groups was lower if you were in the treatment

78
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,560
group than in the control group. That means this relative risk will be less

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,400
than one it'll be a fraction of one and what we do is we subtract that relative

80
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,680
risk from one so one minus the relative risk and that gives us the efficacy. Now

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,200
I've put the second part in here but we really don't use the second part I just

82
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,960
want it's just to keep your mind or to to simulate your stimulate your mind a

83
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
little bit. Imagine that the risk in the treatment was higher then we can't really

84
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,760
talk about efficacy anymore and as much as if this positive outcome was a

85
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,040
negative thing and we want this treatment to lower that risk but now it's

86
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,600
going to increase that risk so we just say relative risk minus one but I warn

87
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
you there then we can't really talk about efficacy anymore the efficacy is

88
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
really just for that first line one minus the relative risk. So let's look at

89
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,480
some coding examples so we're going to simulate a study we're taking 41,100

90
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,320
people in our study which is when these vaccine trials were developed what is

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,640
the power we need to see how many people need to be in there so that we

92
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:12,240
reach a sufficient power to find the significant difference between the two.

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,200
So we say here in our control group there were 20,500 people and in our

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,200
treatment group there were 20,600 people and we're saying in this trial

95
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,840
350 people in the control group develop the positive outcome so this is just

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,120
thumbs up numbers not from a specific trial and 115 in the treatment group

97
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,080
develop the positive outcome so in the case of a vaccine we have 350 people in

98
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,400
the control group they just received a placebo they developed the disease and

99
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,480
only 115 in the treatment group who got the active vaccine developed the positive

100
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,720
outcome which is developing the disease so we're just saving that also as some

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
computer variables so we've got a underscore control and a underscore

102
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,840
treatment and if we just divide those 350 divided by 115 that's not something

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,120
that we would express but just for interstate then there are three times

104
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
more positive cases in the control group than the treatment group now there is no

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,360
denominator in here so if I had lots more people in the placebo group then

106
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,560
in the treatment group that value was going to change so that's not a valid

107
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,520
expression really of what is happening here it's just expressing in this nearly

108
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,160
equal groups that we had there were three times more positive cases in the

109
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,200
control group what we're interested though is is the risk so let's see what

110
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,760
the risk in the control group is which I'm going to call risk underscore control

111
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,360
here so that's a that's the control how many got the disease divided by how many

112
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,520
was in the control group so that's going to be the 350 divided by 20,500 and we

113
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,200
see a value of 0.017 now what you would commonly see is this multiplied by a

114
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,680
thousand so you can say that the risk of developing the disease would be if we

115
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,160
multiply that by a thousand the one two three that'll be 17 people per thousand

116
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,760
people so you'll always see that per thousand per ten thousand per hundred

117
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,160
thousand depending on what makes sense now let's do the same for the treatment

118
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,760
group so that's the a underscore treatment that's how many got the disease in

119
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,120
the treatment group and divided by how many there were that's just the risk and

120
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,680
we see a much lower risk here of 0.005 so there'll be five and a half people per

121
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,000
thousand people develop the disease was it the risk then of developing the

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,880
disease and now we're just going to do the relative risk so it's the risk of

123
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,400
the treatment of the risk of the control and now we see it's 0.32 multiplied by

124
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:55,240
100 that's about that's 32.7% so we want to express efficacy though so we're

125
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,600
going to subtract it from one so one minus that one minus the relative risk

126
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,600
and we get the efficacy 67% so we can say the efficacy of this of this vaccine

127
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,160
was 67% and that is how much it lowered the risk really that is what we're

128
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:20,600
expressing but as I said before that is just one study we did and if we started

129
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,280
a week later we would have had other people in our study if we could do this

130
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,640
over and over again we would get different results every time so this one

131
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,400
result this one efficacy that we found this is one of many possible ones and

132
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:40,400
what we are interested in is not only this 41,000 100 people in our study we

133
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,560
want to infer these results because it's just a sample on the larger

134
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,720
population so what is the true efficacy in the population as a whole because

135
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,280
eventually we want to inoculate everyone so we need to express a confidence

136
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,560
interval around this efficacy and how do we go about that you know so in

137
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,000
different papers you'll see different methods of doing this there are different

138
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,160
equations for doing this cloper Pearson there's some other ways of doing this as

139
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,760
well but what we're going to do here is something that I like to do and that is

140
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,080
just to do resampling from the results that we found and in that way we're going

141
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,200
to build up simulate a bunch we're going to do a thousand as if we're doing our

142
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,800
study a thousand times over that gives us a distribution of poor possible

143
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,840
efficacies and we can then calculate a 95% confidence interval now remember

144
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,000
what confidence interval means maybe I should keep quiet now when we get to

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,960
confidence intervals when we've calculated the confidence intervals I'll

146
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,240
just remind you exactly what that means so here in R we've created a little

147
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,800
function I'm going to call it simulate underscore group it is a function it

148
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,800
takes two parameters n and p now what we're going to do is create this local

149
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,440
variable inside of the function it doesn't exist in the global space so it's

150
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,320
just internal to our function I'm using the our unit function random uniform so

151
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,960
we're going to draw a random number from a uniform distribution a uniform

152
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,960
distribution remember is that every element in the sample space of of this

153
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,120
distribution has an equal likelihood of being chosen at every time we run the

154
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,560
experiment so the random uniform is going to draw from zero to one in that

155
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,140
interval on that interval zero to one it just draws a random value so it will

156
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,680
then throw that value back in the bin so that the next time around we do it that

157
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,320
number is as possible to draw that number again but every value from zero to

158
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,040
one has an equal likelihood of being chosen a uniform distribution it's not

159
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,640
bell shape that certain values are more likely to be chosen at random it's

160
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:05,400
uniform and now what we're going to do is we're going to look at this number that

161
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:14,800
is chosen and we're just going to sum them up if that value is less than p the

162
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,080
probability now that p that we're talking about here is actually the

163
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,960
risk remember there were a certain number of people who got the disease

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,960
inside of that sample of people and if you think about that that the risk that

165
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,520
is if we do that division the number got positive divided by how many there were

166
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,840
that's in essence a probability of this p that we're talking about here in our

167
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,560
function the parameter that we've called p so we're saying we're going to

168
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,840
simulate this and we're going to say that random person we're just

169
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,560
simulating this random person they get this random value and if that value is

170
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,200
less than this p p value now I'm not talking about a statistical p value not

171
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,240
the famous p value I'm just saying this risk if that was smaller than that when

172
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,880
then we're going to start summing them up and that's a simulation because anyone

173
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,680
can get from from 0 to 1 and this value that was chosen there and we only sum

174
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,120
them up we only sum it up when it is less than the numbers that are come out

175
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,920
less than this p value the risk in action in actual fact and what we're going

176
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:41,120
to return is this k divided by n the n that we supplied to the function the

177
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,880
sample size so let's let's look at that so I'm storing p now as in this instance

178
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,680
we're going to take the risk in the treatment group so the number got

179
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,040
positive and divided by the total number they were that's our p and now we're

180
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,280
going to run a single simulation so we're just going to say n treatment p and

181
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,920
we just run that and now we have not seeded the seed of random number generator

182
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,920
here so every time you run this code you're going to get a different value but

183
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,640
in this instance I got 0.0055 now we're going to use less comprehension and

184
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:23,720
you'll see early on this notebook I just I just loaded this comprehend R package

185
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,120
because it contains this function to VEC and it's going to allow us to do less

186
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,760
comprehension on this instance vector comprehension so I'm just going to

187
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,200
simulate this thousand values all in one go so that I just have this vector of a

188
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,680
thousand possible instances I'm going to store that as t so we're just going to

189
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,680
simulate this risk in actual fact over and over and over and over again so

190
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,320
sometimes the value is going to be more than p and it won't be summed and

191
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,360
sometimes it's less than p and it will be summed from what we've done way up

192
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,920
there so if we do that we get these thousand values and we can draw the

193
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,520
sconal density estimate plot and it shows us this distribution of risks

194
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,440
simulated risks there we go for these thousand times as if we could do the

195
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,400
study a thousand times over and there you see the distribution of risk a lot of

196
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:31,080
them here by 0.05 just over that open of 0.053 there abouts 4 and that was

197
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,440
just simulating that over and over again now one way that we can express this

198
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,520
sort of range of values the measures of dispersion would be standard error and

199
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,600
what we've done here is just to take the standard error that's the standard

200
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,720
deviation of t in this instance and we can see it there and because we've got

201
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:02,040
this distribution now we can we can calculate the from all these values

202
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,680
these t values we can calculate these cutoff values so for that I'm going to

203
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,920
use the quantile function and I'm just passing that 1000 values to it and I'm

204
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,640
saying calculate for us these intervals that will be 5% cutoff at the bottom

205
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,400
95% cutoff at the top so if you look at this basically it's going to cut

206
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:30,360
off the bottom 5% and cut off the top 5% and that gives us a 90% confidence

207
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,000
interval then and the values within this thousand values of ours that gave us

208
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,640
that was 0.00475 to 0.0064 so then we're saying a 90% confidence interval

209
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:55,840
around this around this risk of ours the mean risk was going to be these values

210
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,560
so you're not necessarily interested in this single one we want the relative

211
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,960
risk so we're going to create another little equation here another function I

212
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,980
should say and it's just going to do what we've done before twice for the

213
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,440
control group and for the treatment group this time so that we can have this

214
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,880
efficacy as 1 minus the relative risk risk 2 that's going to be the treatment

215
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,240
divided by risk 1 which is going to be the control so we've got to pass four

216
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,480
parameters there so the p-value that we are going to ask for it to count below

217
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,240
as the p1 will be the controls risk and the p2 will be the treatment arms risk

218
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,920
and then we just simulate that once and it'll give us back one possible

219
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:49,360
efficacy 65.9% now again using this two-vec function I'm going to create

220
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,120
this vector of a thousand efficacies all in one go calling this function of our

221
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,720
simulate trial and the simulate trial remember it calls the simulate underscore

222
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,680
group function twice one for each of these two groups of ours and if we plot

223
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,240
the kernel density estimate there we see that we have this range of values

224
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,480
possible values we just simulated so we've resampled based on this finding

225
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,640
that we had for this specific study and then we see the mean efficacy of the

226
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,800
1000 simulator trials was 0.67 our actual one was also 0.67 that's where it's

227
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,840
going to work out so if we want a 90% confidence interval for that we just

228
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,040
pass those thousand values to the quantile function and we set a probability

229
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,080
cut off the bottom 5% the top 5% what were the values within T2 which is where

230
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,360
we saved a thousand values would be 60.8 to 72.7 so we can say the

231
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,280
efficacy of this study for this drug or this vaccine was 67% 90 or 90%

232
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:07,280
confidence intervals 60 to 72 or about 61% to about 73% so that's 90% confidence

233
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
intervals and now let me just remind you what confidence intervals is we're not

234
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,520
saying that we are 90% confident that in the globe as a whole if we gave it to

235
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,760
everyone and that we are 90 it's not to say that we're 90% sure that the true

236
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,760
efficacy in the world population as a whole will be this no that's not what

237
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,080
it means it means if we ran the study 100 times over just imagine what that

238
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,560
would cost now long that would take but if we ran it a hundred times over every

239
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,320
time we're going to get slightly different confidence intervals in 90% of

240
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:47,720
those the true population will be true population efficacy will be within the

241
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,200
confidence intervals that we set so we're not saying that's true for the

242
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,360
specific one is if we could do it hundred times over in 90 of them 90 of

243
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:05,080
them will capture within its bounds the true population efficacy now that we've

244
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,640
done that let's go and see this trial that was done in South Africa with

245
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,320
AstraZeneca trial and now this trial I'm going to warn you I mean from the time

246
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,840
of this recording it's just on as a available the pre-printed was not not

247
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,600
accepted by a journal yet not peer reviewed yet and on the space on the

248
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,480
evidence of this very small study the the vaccine was withdrawn from South

249
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
Africa so there was about a million doses available this was the first

250
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,800
doses of any vaccine to land in South Africa it was ready to be distributed

251
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:46,120
amongst health care workers and it got pulled on the strength of the study now

252
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,920
the study has more than one component so what we're going to look at is just a

253
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,280
clinical side of it looking at the relative risk and the efficacy but it

254
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,640
was also about it was about more than that there was part of the analysis was

255
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,760
also on the neutralizing antibodies and whether they could were effective against

256
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,000
the variant that's prevalent within South Africa so it's not just based on

257
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,960
this but I want to show you what the what relative risk does in efficacy what

258
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,520
it would look like at least the uncertainty in the value when we're

259
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,240
dealing with a small trial and how difficult it becomes in a small trial

260
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,760
where the risk is relatively low so let's look at that so you can click on

261
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,960
the link there to find the pre-print of this article and there were some

262
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,680
important points so the primary endpoint and I've just listed them here the

263
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,960
primary endpoint was this efficacy of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 more than

264
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,080
14 days after the second dose so waited 14 days after the second dose then start

265
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,360
looking at whether people develop confirmed symptomatic COVID so the

266
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,400
primary for the primary efficacy analysis only per perperatical seronegative

267
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,400
participants were included and the vex vaccine efficacy VE was calculated as 1

268
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
minus the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated

269
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,320
using the clopper Pearson exact method as reported so that's not what we're doing

270
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,960
we are using resampling which is what I like to do there's a bunch of these

271
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,480
tests and they have their strengths and weaknesses and debate about you know

272
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,280
whether they work or not and when they should be used and when not my feeling

273
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,000
on the matter use use resampling so whether a thousand and ten participants

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,920
received vaccine and a thousand and eleven received placebo and in the end

275
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:48,040
there was a lot of exclusions you can read the papers to why in the end though

276
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,760
remember our simulated study before had over 40,000 people in them 20,000 more

277
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,280
than 20,000 each arm yeah there was only 715 in the vaccine group there was

278
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:08,200
analyzed and 750 vaccine and 717 in the placebo group so very small now and

279
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,160
other problems with the trial and I don't say that's problems the trial does

280
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,440
correctly done is this we want to infer that to a larger population the

281
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,920
population out there and of course the participants in the study were not

282
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,560
representative of the population as a whole it was only representative of

283
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,680
certain people in the population because the median age was very young was only

284
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:40,560
31 years 56 and a half percent were male and then there was a racial

285
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,560
distribution as well all 42 endpoint cases were graded as either mild or

286
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,160
moderate so there were no severe cases following this trial so even in the

287
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,480
placebo group there was no severe cases and we can see in the vaccine group

288
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:08,480
15 mild and 4 moderate and then 17 mild and 6 moderate so there are no cases of

289
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,520
severe disease or hospitalization in either arm so that makes it very

290
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,160
difficult because half of these people receive placebo to infer the results to

291
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,600
the larger population so let's just see how they you know if we do the relative

292
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,760
risk and we look specifically at the uncertainty around the relative risk

293
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,440
that's what this is all about so there was 717 in the control group 750 in the

294
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,600
treatment group 17 plus 6 that's the mild plus moderate got the disease in the

295
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,120
control group and 15 plus 4 that's in the treatment group so we're gonna work

296
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,440
out the risk in the control group which is just that very simple ratio and the

297
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,920
risk in the treatment group so that we can express the relative risk and the

298
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,800
relative risk as you can see there that was lower than one so we subtracted

299
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,160
from one and we get the efficacy and that was the headline it was only 21%

300
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:10,720
effective only 21% effective and of course mostly you'll see that we're

301
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,480
looking for at least 50% efficacy in these but here comes the problem we need

302
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,440
to express our uncertainty in this 21% efficacy and so again we're going to

303
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,160
create our two functions the one that just simulates again from a random

304
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,440
uniform distribution just as we did before only counting those that was

305
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,360
lower than this risk value and then we're going to simulate it at the two

306
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,600
risks and we express the efficacy again as one minus the risk two over risk one

307
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,000
so risk of the treatment divided by risk of the control group and our P values

308
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,200
again remember that just taken from the outcome of this actual study the two

309
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,080
risks and then we're going to simulate it and I've run a simulation just this

310
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:05,520
once and we get a negative value we get a negative value and now this becomes

311
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,200
very difficult to interpret and let me show you why because now we're going to

312
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,000
simulate it a thousand times using this two-vec function so we can do list or

313
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,560
vector comprehension so in one go we get our thousand values and here I've used

314
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,880
plotly and not the inbuilt r plotting so we can see here this distribution around

315
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:33,320
the around the efficacy and you can see how it tails off below zero now how do

316
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,800
we interpret that so I leave that for you in the comments to interpret that

317
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,160
because if you think about it we're actually back in the real or realm of

318
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,320
the vaccine actually increasing the risk okay and that's the way that their

319
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,320
values are going to come out and you can see this bump here right at the top it

320
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:02,800
is at about about 21, 22, 23 percent the efficacy and what we

321
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,680
interested now is the 95% confidence intervals so we said the efficacy of

322
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,320
this study of the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 21 percent and now you see the

323
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:25,400
95% confidence intervals around that from negative 50% to about 59% so it's

324
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:32,080
quite possible that the efficacy of this efficacy out in the population just

325
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
based on the study that the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine out in the

326
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,600
population is somewhere between there so this is bizarre on this side of course

327
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,040
and as I say leave your thoughts in the comment what this negative values would

328
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:52,240
really be but this is we're still within the 95% confidence intervals almost 60%

329
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,480
efficacy of the AstraZeneca so very difficult to make decisions based on a

330
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:06,520
small study like this where our risk is very low the risk was very low for

331
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,160
someone to develop the disease both in the placebo arm and in the treatment arm

332
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,440
and the efficacy they've the two risks were very close to each other meaning

333
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,400
the efficacy was only 21% because these values are so small and we simulate a

334
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,120
thousand of these when we express our uncertainty in this 21% you see that

335
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,280
this uncertainty is quite big and as I say this the idea behind the study was

336
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,960
not only looking at this to make the decision to withdraw the use of the

337
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,800
vaccine that's AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa because a part of the study

338
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,720
was also about neutralizing antibodies etc there's a whole other parts to that

339
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,520
but see how difficult it is or how difficult it can be if you've got

340
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,880
relatively small sample sizes and the risk is also small then you are going to

341
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,160
struggle to make a decision because your uncertainty in your efficacy is not

342
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,720
going to be very good there's going to be a wide confidence interval in the

343
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,680
efficacy so I hope this was interesting for you leave some comments down below

344
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:19,000
remember to like the video you can read this these notebooks here on our pubs

345
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,680
or follow the link down below to download the RMD files the our markdown files if

346
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,800
you've got our studio you can just import that and you can play around with

347
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,400
these values maybe simulate some more draw some pretty graphs etc and I hope

348
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,960
this really helped you to understand the idea a very relevant example of

349
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,600
understanding relative risk and efficacy

350
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,060
