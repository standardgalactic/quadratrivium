1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So what I'm going to do now is show you something beautiful, some beautiful mathematics.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We can't do much in physics or we can't start this discussion properly

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
as far as the gradients and Hamiltonians are concerned

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
if we don't understand the concept of the minimum.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Something is at a minimum and that is how nature decides what to do.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Nature decides that the shortest distance between two points

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in a clean space is going to be a straight line.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How does it decide that?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
There must be something underlying this decision in nature.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's the concept of the minimum and you've got to understand it

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
through the concept of the calculus of variations.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So how do we do that?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There's going to be many boards and I'll have to wipe the board in between.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's just have a look at this.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I have the XY plane and I have two points which is a starting point

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and a final point and there's various paths I can take through this.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So you could in space, there's my X and there's my Y.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm going to go from one point to the other point on some path.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can imagine I can go to Andromeda Galaxy and back

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and there will still be one path if Andromeda is there

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
at least if I could just go in a two dimensional plane.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There is many lines I can take between this

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but I want the shortest possible distance between those two.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The shortest possible distance.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now one way I can measure this, any of the paths

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that I can possibly choose is just to divide it into tiny little segments

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of say a specific length delta S.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So let's blow that up a little bit.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If I were to blow that up it's almost going to be a straight line.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Most lecturers would skip this but then go straight to the integral

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
but this is good so this is going to be this arc length.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It has a length but it will have from that point to that point

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
a delta Y and a delta X.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So the length of delta S is very nearly going to be what?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well the square root of that per se, this is Pythagorean theorem.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So that will be delta X squared plus delta Y squared.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Very beautiful and we know if I can let delta X approach

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the limit take the limit as this approaches zero,

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
this is going to become smaller, this line segment will become shorter

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and right in the end I'm going to have this differential tiny little distance dS

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
which is going to be the square root of dx squared plus dy squared.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We can all see that and I can rewrite this.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Just want to show you how nice you can rewrite it of course.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're going to say dS is going to equal the square root of,

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can take a dx squared out which will leave me one plus dy squared over dx squared.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's beautiful.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've just taken this out as a common factor.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If I were to multiply this back in there of course I'm going to line it back up there.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In other words dS I can write as the square root of one plus,

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
let's just call it Y prime, Y with respect to x squared

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and that's very ugly, I should do that.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can see as the whole it's dy squared and dx squared.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So that and I'm just calling it Y prime dx.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's what I'm doing.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So that will be the length of an infinitesimally small little line segment there.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've zoomed in so much that it actually is a straight line so I go from approximate to absolutely equal to

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and that is in the limit as delta X goes to zero.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And what can I do?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How do we do integration if I have to just sum all of these together?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I take the integral of that.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So if I were to take the integral of both sides, what am I left with?

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
S, the total distance of this arc, so this is just a line integral,

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
is going to be this definite integral and going from x1 to x1 to x2

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
of the square root of 1 plus Y prime squared dx.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So there's my line integral.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And this is setting up distance, but this needn't be distance.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can set up many things in physics.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I might want to know what the shortest time is.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So there's going to be some path chosen that represents the shortest time.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can have many things in here.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can have not just distance but shape what would be the minimum surface area of something.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I can do that by just setting up an equation for surface area.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So what we do in calculation of various calculations of variations is

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we're just going to call this I, that is this group for not only length

75
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
but surface area, time, anything.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's going to be something that I can now plot on a,

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
so there's needn't be distance and distance.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We can have something else.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But it's going to go from some initial point which I'll call x sub 1

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and some final point which I'll call x sub 2.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just to refer to the fact that there's something on one of the axes

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
of some function and if I look at this function very carefully

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it's actually a function of x, y and y prime with respect to that axis.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So it's from one point to another point on that axis.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So it's the f of x, y and y prime.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now there's no x in there but that one might as well have been x to the power 0.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So there is and there's no y, just a normal y in there

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
but that might also have been y to the power 0.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In effect this is a distance one so there was no x and y in there

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
but there could be.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So there's a function of x, y and y prime.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So at any time we can set this up.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's called a functional.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is called a functional that I'm going to do something

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and it's going to give me some scale of value.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And I'll clean the board and we're going to use this concept

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to prove to you that in the Euclidean space,

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
and it's not some funny space, it's flat space,

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that the shortest distance between that point and that point

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
is going to be a straight line, we're going to develop this

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
to prove that that is indeed so and through doing that

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
hopefully I'll show you that that is what nature does

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
and that's what we can do.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We're going to use the calculus of variation

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to show that there is something in here that is a minimum distance

106
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
or a minimum time or a minimum surface area

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and that is what nature chooses.

108
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to clean the board and we'll carry on.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The board is clean, let's have a look.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So there we go.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now imagine, I'm going to construct something.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So imagine I knew the answer.

113
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The equation for that curve between the two points

114
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which is the minimum.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Imagine I knew that and that solution was the y of x,

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
small y of x.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now let's construct another function,

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
we'll call it capital y of x,

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and that's going to include this small y of x

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
plus some constant multiple of a second function

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
called eta of x,

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
as most textbooks will do it this way.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I'm going to pause the video here

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and just insert another video I made

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
which is a screencast of how this is actually the absolute truth.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Before I do that I just want to make two things abundantly clear

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and we're going to set this up.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is like a magician setting up something specifically

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
so that it works out for him or her.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And we're going to set this situation up

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
so that it does work for us.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So this is my one point and my other point

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
and we all know intuitively this is going to end up being a straight line

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
but what if it isn't?

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I have this curve there

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and right at this x sub 1

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and right at this x sub 2

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to choose another curve

139
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and that's my curve,

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
eta of x

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
such that at these points x1 and x2

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
it has a y value of 0

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and I can choose many of these

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
just by changing this constant multiple eta.

145
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If eta is 1 this would be one curve

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
if eta is 1.5 it will be another curve

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
if eta is negative 3 this would be another curve

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and this was my two answer which is a secret up till now

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
but imagine I knew what it was

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and if I just add this at every point I just add these two

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
then I was going to have something like this

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but you can imagine this capital Y of x

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
is just these two additives

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but you imagine they are multiple

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
for every eta of x

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can choose any constant

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
which will give me an infinite number of these little curves

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
which means added to the real answer

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can get many others

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and remember single variable

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
just normal variable calculus

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
if I just had a curve

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
if I had a curve

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and I wanted to know the minimum of the maximum

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
well all these extreme points

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
extreme would be at spots where the derivative

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
the first derivative was going to be 0

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that is a minimum or maximum

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and I knew it was a minimum

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
if I took the second derivative

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and if that answer was at that point was larger than 0

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I knew that to be a minimum

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and that's the same thing we're going to do to this

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we want a minimum

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the derivative of this

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and set it equal to 0

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
remember this is how I set up my distance

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I had s equals

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
a different integral from x1 to x2

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
of the square root of 1 plus y prime squared dx

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
that was my distance

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to take the derivative of that

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and I want to set it equal to 0

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and if I do that

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to get to the minimum point

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and that's what we want

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
something that this line falls exactly on top of that line

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
because if I do that

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
there will be some minimum

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and that will be the two result that I get there

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm ahead of myself

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
so this is what we set up

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to pause the video here

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and insert that a little bit

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
just to show you that this is an actual fact

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
you can set this up

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
in many ways you can set this up

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
this is not some trickery here that is mathematically unsound

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's very sound

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you can set this up and I'll show you in the video

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
so here we go

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
let me show you

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I want to construct this capital Y of x

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
in terms of small y of x

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
plus some other function eta of x

206
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and at eta of x I want to be able to multiply by some constant

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
so I've set some things up here

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
let's have a look at them

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
let's just take some of these away

210
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and let's just bring them back

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
one by one

212
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
just that this is my y of x

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I've made it a straight line

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
it needn't be a straight line

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and here's my eta of x

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and I'm just drawing in these two straight lines

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
just to note that I've constructed eta x

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
in this instance it is something here

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
there we go

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
there's my epsilon

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
which I've called in here

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and it's this

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
minus x minus 4 squared plus 1

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll show you now why I put the n in there

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
so what I'm saying is

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
one thing

227
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've got to construct this so that

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
at x1 and x2

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
which is this spot here

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and that spot there

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want that to correspond

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
here to the same values

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
that's why I've got the two straight lines

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and the fact that

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the y value for eta of x

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
down here has got to be 0

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and 0 at both points

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that's the way I want to set this up

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
so what I have now

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
is the capital Y of x

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and the capital Y of x

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
between x1 and x2

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
has got to be the addition of these two

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and this is what we have right up here

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this is this green

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
note though

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
that because eta of x is 0

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
at this point I'm not adding anything to

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
small y of x

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and at that point I'm not adding anything to

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
small y of x

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
at these two curves

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
at every point on the x axis

254
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
between x1 and x2

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
if I added this value to that value

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was going to get that top value

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that's what I'm saying

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
but look at this if I put eta in front of it

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
which here I've called n

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
it doesn't matter what size I make

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
eta

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it's just some constant multiple

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
what epsilon I mean

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
my n here is epsilon

265
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
sorry for that

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
this value I make epsilon

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it's a constant multiple

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
it is a constant multiple

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
of eta of x

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and these points still

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
correspond to

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
my little y of x

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and my little y of x there

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
so it doesn't matter

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I now have this

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
almost well I can say

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
indefinite number of capital Y of x

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
every time that I change

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
epsilon

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to have a different capital Y of x

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
look at the green curve

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
there are so many of them

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
look how many of them

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
there are

285
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that means to get from

286
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
1.1

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to .2

288
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
there are many many

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
paths that I can take

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
and I've got to find the

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
shortest one basically

292
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
that's why I'm setting up this problem

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I want some minimum value

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and the problem I'm going to deal with

295
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
obviously minimum arc length

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
between these two points

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
but just to show you

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that I can construct

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
this capital Y of x

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in the manner that I've done on the board

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and it makes absolute sense

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and you can just see it

303
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
beautifully in this illustration

304
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
good I hope you enjoyed that

305
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
now this is beautiful mathematics

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
stay with me you'll see where this is going

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
so what we're suggesting

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
and remember that was

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
my equation and I'm going to take the derivative

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
of that and set it equal to 0

311
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that will give me the minimum value

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that's all we're going to do

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
but I don't have this anymore

314
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I've changed it

315
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
that refers to what I had in me

316
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the real answer was going to come from that

317
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
was going to come from that

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
the real distance was going to have

319
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
some equation to it

320
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
some value to it

321
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
that in the actual fact that now

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
is a new function

323
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
in x capital Y

324
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in capital Y prime

325
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that is what I have now

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
so by constructing this addition

327
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I've changed it from

328
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
x small y small y prime

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to x large y y prime

330
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
so

331
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
some suggestion of this

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
will be remember that was

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
the square root of 1 plus y square

334
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
y prime squared

335
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but if I do this to it

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going to have

337
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
this as my f of x

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have this

339
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and I'm going to just do

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
some preliminary work

341
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and you'll see shortly why I'm doing this preliminary work

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
if I

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
if I had this

344
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
function

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
imagine let me just write it out

346
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
y of x

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
equals the y of x

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
plus

349
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
epsilon eta of x

350
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
what if I

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
were to take the derivative

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
of this with respect to this constant

353
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
can you take a derivative with respect

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
of constant of course you can because

355
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
what is 4

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
other than 4x to the power

357
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
0

358
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
if I were to take the derivative with respect

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
to x

360
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can still take the derivative here

361
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
with respect to x

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
that's probably not the best way

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
to explain it

364
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
let me rather do this

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
can I say

366
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
d y

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
capital Y of x

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
d epsilon

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
can I say that

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
now I don't necessarily want to do that

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
it's going to be a bit difficult

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
let's do the partial derivative

373
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
partial derivative with respect

374
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to that constant

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
appear there

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
so that's going to equal 0

377
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and

378
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
as I said I could have written this

379
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
with an x to the power 0

380
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and what you can see this as

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
basically I suppose

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
is just the product of two functions

383
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
so I can take the derivative of this

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
times that

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and this times the derivative of that

386
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
so I can actually have the

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
d epsilon

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
d epsilon

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
eta x

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
plus eta times

391
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
d

392
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
del

393
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
whichever way you want to pronounce it

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
of

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
eta x

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
so what are we going to have here

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
we're going to have the fact that

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
that's 0

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that is 1

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
so we will

401
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
definitely have that

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so that will be the eta of x

403
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and there's no eta in there

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
so the partial derivative

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
of that with respect to epsilon

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
sorry is 0 0

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
times epsilon is 0

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
so the derivative of capital Y of x

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
with respect to epsilon is just

410
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
eta of x

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
let's take y prime

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
of x

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
well it's just going to be that

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
prime

415
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
and you can put the examples in here

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and just show it to yourself

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and what is going to happen here

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
well it's with respect to

419
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
x that I'm taking

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
that I'm taking this derivative

421
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that is a function of x

422
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
so this is very easy this is going to be

423
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
epsilon eta prime

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
of x

425
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
in what way to happen if I took the

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
partial derivative of y prime

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
with respect to

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
epsilon

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
there's definitely a partial derivative

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
there's nothing in there that's going to be a 0

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
exactly the same thing has happened there

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
it's going to happen here

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
so we're just going to have eta prime of x

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
so that's all we're going to have

435
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
so these are the two equations

436
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
some preliminary work

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I probably shouldn't have bought it in here

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
because you wonder why is he doing this

439
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
why is he doing this

440
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
let's clean the board and we'll carry on

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
let's carry on

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
now remember this thing

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
back I had my equation

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
which was this 1 plus y prime

445
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
square root of that

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
what were to happen if I

447
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
took the derivative of this

448
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
of this function

449
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
well I would have had to use the chain rule

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
so when I had the f of

451
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
x, y and y prime

452
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I was going to have to use the chain rule

453
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
nothing changes if I have

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
this

455
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
if I have that function I'm also going to

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
have the chain rule

457
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but because I have changed this

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
into that

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I have a new

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
function i

461
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
which I now want to make a function

462
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
of epsilon

463
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
that is now going to be

464
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
x of 1 to x of 2

465
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of the f of x

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
capital Y

467
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
capital Y prime dx

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I have now changed

469
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
when I went from

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
my previous solution to this solution

471
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I have now made this

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
a function of

473
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
eta because I could get

474
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
many y of x's

475
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
by simply just

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
changing this constant

477
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
so this now becomes a constant

478
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
of this function

479
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and if I wanted to take the derivative

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
of this

481
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
if I wanted to take the derivative

482
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
of this with respect to

483
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
epsilon

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
why did I say eta all the time

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
you know what I mean when I write this

486
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
when I write this with respect to

487
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
with respect to epsilon

488
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
what is going to happen

489
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
now that is why I chose things

490
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
very carefully I also want to

491
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
do it at a point

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
where epsilon equals

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
0 and that's why I set things up

494
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
so remember when I showed you

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
on the screencast

496
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
that's why I chose things one of the reasons

497
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and there's another reason there's sales

498
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I wanted to because of that equals

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
0 then

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
my large y of x

501
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
this one will be exactly equal

502
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
to this one they'll fall on top of each other

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and I'll have my solution

504
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
and another thing is

505
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
remember when I took the derivative

506
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
when f hat is 0

507
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I have a minimum

508
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
so this is the secret

509
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
to this whole thing I'm going to take the derivative

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
so I've changed it to a function of eta

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm going to take the derivative

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
with respect to eta exactly where eta

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
is 0

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and if I set it equal to 0

515
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
that is the calculation

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the calculus of variations

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
now just as we had

518
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
here I would have had to use the chain rule

519
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
let's use the chain rule

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
of this because if I

521
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
take the derivative of this

522
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
it's actually this

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
if I take the derivative of

524
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I with respect to eta

525
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it's the same as doing my integral

526
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and taking the derivative of this inside

527
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
remember your first year calculus

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
so what we're saying here

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
they're just going to equal

530
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
the different integral going from this to that

531
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
and I'll have to apply the chain rule

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
so I'm actually going to have

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
d i f

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
d i small

535
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
let's do that

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
d i f d i capital Y times

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
del Y

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
del

539
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
epsilon plus

540
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
we must not make a mistake here

541
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and I'm going to have f with respect to

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
y prime times

543
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
y prime

544
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
over epsilon

545
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
all of that

546
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
dx

547
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
so don't get confused here this is just the chain rule

548
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
of a function

549
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
of any function

550
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
remember if you were to take the chain rule

551
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
of something if you would take the first derivative

552
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
of something as simple as this

553
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
it would be very easy to do

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
this was going to be to the power half

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you bring the half forward

556
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and that becomes negative of half

557
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
the derivative of the inside function as well

558
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
which is going to be 2y prime

559
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
so it's easy to do

560
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
for any function f of x y

561
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and y prime

562
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was going to use the chain rule

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
so yeah I'm also going to use the chain rule

564
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
nothing different and that's exactly

565
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
what I have there

566
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and remember just the board before

567
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I did this

568
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and I did this so I know

569
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
what this is this was

570
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
remember what this was

571
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
or that was this

572
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
eta of x

573
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
remember that

574
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
rewind and you'll see and what was this

575
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
it was

576
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
eta prime of x

577
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
okay

578
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
so that works for me

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and this has got to equal 0

580
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
because if I set it equal to 0

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
then I have a minimum

582
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
okay we know where it was

583
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
it's going to be an extreme

584
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
but let's call it a minimum for now

585
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
because that is exactly what it is

586
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
okay so we are there

587
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
what I want you to realize is one thing

588
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I can do this

589
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
as integration by parts

590
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
remember the integration by parts

591
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I just have to decide which one is u

592
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
and which one is v prime

593
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and that's very easy to do

594
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
let's choose my v prime

595
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
equal to this

596
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
eta prime of x

597
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that makes my v equal

598
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
to the prime eta of x

599
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
and if this was that

600
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
then that must mean

601
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
this one is u

602
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
by if

603
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
by capital Y prime

604
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and that makes my u prime the d dx

605
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of

606
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
by if

607
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
by y prime

608
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
now I can just simply do

609
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
integration by parts

610
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
remember that would be this times that

611
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
minus

612
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
the integral

613
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
of this one times that one

614
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
remember integration by parts

615
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
but I want to show you something

616
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
very specific here as well

617
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and that's why I set things up

618
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I was a magician and I set things up that they were

619
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
out specifically for me

620
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I said I want to do this

621
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
around a point where eta equals 0

622
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and what's going to happen

623
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
when eta equals 0

624
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
when eta equals 0

625
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
capital Y of x

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
and small y of x are going to be

627
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
exactly the same thing

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
they're going to be exactly the same thing

629
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
so what we're going to have

630
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
is the following so remember when I have

631
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
the integral

632
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
of the sum of two functions

633
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I can just do them separately

634
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
so here I'm going to have

635
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
x sub 1 to x sub 2

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
of del f

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
del y

638
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm making it a small y now because I'm setting

639
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
things up way epsilon equals

640
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
0 so then I will have

641
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
capital and lowercase

642
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
y of x is being exactly

643
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
the same times the eta

644
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
of x

645
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
del x

646
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
now for this side

647
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm going to do this integration by parts

648
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
so it's u times v so it's d

649
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
these two so it's del f

650
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
del y prime times

651
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
eta

652
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
of x

653
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
from x sub 1 to x sub 2

654
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
minus

655
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
the integral of

656
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
going from x sub 1 to x sub 2

657
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
of these two

658
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so it's

659
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
d dx of

660
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
del f

661
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
del y prime

662
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
eta

663
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
what was that

664
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
eta of x

665
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
dx and that's going to equal 0

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I hope you can still see that

667
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
now remember also when I did here

668
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I let these two

669
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
points be exactly the same

670
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
so if I were to plug

671
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
those into there

672
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was going to get 0

673
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
so this whole turn disappears

674
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
this whole turn disappears

675
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and what am I left with

676
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
this integral

677
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
minus this integral

678
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
is going to equal 0 I can put them all together

679
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
in the same integral because this is

680
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
the difference between two functions

681
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and I can take

682
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
these two out

683
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
is a common factor

684
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and what am I going to be left with

685
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
going from x sub 1 to x sub 2

686
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
of what

687
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
well we're going to have

688
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
del f del y

689
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
minus

690
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
the dx of

691
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
del f

692
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
del y prime

693
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
all of that times

694
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
the eta of x

695
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
all of that dx is going to equal

696
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
0

697
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and that low and behold

698
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
is the way we were trying to get this

699
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
is a thing of beauty

700
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
now I want to set this up

701
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
for any

702
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
eta of x

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
any eta of x

704
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
because for a different integral

705
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
to equal 0 that means this

706
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
inner part

707
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
this integrand has got to be 0

708
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
but I want it to be for any

709
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
function of 0 so

710
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
arbitrary function of eta

711
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and so if that can't be 0

712
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
it's being multiplied by this

713
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
this has got to equal 0

714
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and that

715
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
is the Euler

716
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Lagrange function

717
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and it states the following

718
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
that del f

719
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
del y

720
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
minus

721
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
the dx

722
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
of del f

723
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
del y prime

724
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
equals 0

725
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
there we are

726
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
that is the thing of beauty

727
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
and remember when my f was this

728
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
this was my f of xy and y prime

729
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
if I were to take the derivative

730
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
of this with respect to y

731
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and I took the derivative

732
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
of this with respect to y prime

733
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and then the derivative

734
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
of that

735
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
equal to 0 I was going to get

736
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the answer

737
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
for the shortest distance between those two points

738
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
but I generalised it as I

739
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
so it might be the shortest time

740
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
it might be the shortest surface area

741
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I can use the Euler Lagrange equation

742
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to set up many physical

743
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
problems

744
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
if I can just through my physical problem

745
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
develop this

746
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and we'll look at examples

747
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
in the next video I might just show you

748
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
how this distance between two points is a straight line

749
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
by solving

750
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
this Euler Lagrange

751
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
but this Euler Lagrange equation

752
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
right here is absolutely a

753
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
thing of beauty

754
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and we set it up right from here

755
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
right from the start

756
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
we use the simple fact that the first derivative

757
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
if you set it to 0 you are going to get an extreme point

758
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and that extreme point

759
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
is going to be a minimum

760
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
value for you

761
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it's going to work out in this instance to be a minimum

762
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
instead of an extreme point

763
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and you're going to land up

764
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
with this

765
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
this is a real

766
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
true a thing of mathematical

767
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
beauty

768
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
now

769
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
let me prove to you that the

770
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
shortest distance between two points on the Euclidean surface

771
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
is just a straight line

772
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
nature will always choose

773
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
a straight line

774
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
so you'll remember my equation for

775
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
using integration a line integral

776
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
for the length of

777
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
any arc

778
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
is that

779
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
this is my Euler Lagrange equation

780
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
so let's just do that

781
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
this is my F

782
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
this is my function F

783
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
function of x, y and y prime

784
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
let's get

785
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
iF times y

786
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
what is that going to equal

787
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
of this this bit well

788
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
there's no y in there so this is going to be 0

789
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
that was a simple one

790
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
y prime

791
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
well there's a y prime in there

792
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
so I better do this properly and I've got to do it

793
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
we said it before

794
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I've got to do it

795
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
by

796
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
the following method

797
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
so what is that going to be

798
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm going to bring the half forward so that was going to be a half

799
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
times

800
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
again we

801
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
we're still going to have this

802
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
squared to the power negative

803
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
for half and then I still have to multiply

804
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
by the inner

805
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
which is going to be 2 times y prime

806
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that's really firstly a calculus

807
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
except that this is a partial derivative

808
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
but there is y prime in there

809
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
so these two are going to go

810
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
so what am I left with

811
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm left with y prime over

812
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
the square root of 1 plus y prime

813
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
squared

814
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
that's what I'm left with

815
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and so

816
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
they are left with 0 so I have

817
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
minus

818
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
dvx of

819
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
that which is now

820
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
just this

821
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
y prime over the

822
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
square root of 1 plus y prime

823
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
squared is going to equal

824
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
0

825
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
which I can multiply both sides

826
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
by negative 1 so this will disappear

827
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
simply

828
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
when is the derivative of

829
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
any function equal to 0

830
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
when that function is a constant

831
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
isn't it so all of this

832
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is some constant

833
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
in other words

834
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
y prime equals

835
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
some constant times the square root of

836
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
1 plus y prime

837
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
squared

838
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I can square both sides

839
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
if I square both sides

840
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I get rid of this

841
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and I square my constant

842
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
which leaves me with another constant

843
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I can multiply this constant in there

844
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
so I'm going to see

845
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
some constant plus some constant

846
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I can bring this over to one side

847
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
which means y prime

848
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I can get on its own

849
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
which is then going to leave me

850
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
with 1 minus this

851
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
squared

852
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
remember I squared this now

853
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
to get rid of that

854
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and that is going to

855
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
still equal some constant

856
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm going to divide this into that side

857
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
which is giving me another constant

858
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
and in the end I'm going to

859
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
take the square root of that so y prime

860
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
is going to be some constant

861
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
just run through that

862
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'll be fishing

863
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
but just do it for yourself

864
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
you'll notice very quickly

865
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that y prime

866
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
is equal to some constant

867
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
when is the derivative, how can a function of x

868
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
y prime of x

869
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
how can that be a constant

870
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
well the only way that that can be

871
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is if the y of x

872
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
equals ax

873
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
plus b

874
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
if you take the derivative of that

875
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
that would come forward

876
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
so that's just my constant a

877
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
there's no x in there so that falls away

878
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and what is that in the equation of

879
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
a straight line

880
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
proof that the shortest distance

881
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
between any two points in euclidean

882
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
two dimensional euclidean plane

883
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
is a straight line

884
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
how did I solve that

885
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I set up my

886
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
differential

887
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
here

888
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
which is my

889
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
differential there

890
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and I used the calculation of

891
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
the calculus of variations

892
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
to set up the Lagrange-Waley equation

893
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I used the Lagrange-Waley equation

894
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and I proved that the shortest distance is there

895
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
so if I set something else

896
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
of the any physical system

897
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll have to set up this function f

898
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and if I can set that function

899
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
of f with its time

900
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
with its surface area

901
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I can use the Lagrange-Waley equation

902
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
to always give me the minimum

903
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that is why I can set up a physical system

904
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
where I can look at time

905
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
what will be the shortest time

906
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I can set up the surface area

907
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and the most famous one of those

908
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
is if you have two rings

909
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
one smaller, one larger

910
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and you put them in some of this

911
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
bubbly soapy water

912
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
and you bring them out and you'll separate them

913
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
and that will form a very specific

914
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
pattern between those two

915
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
soapy bubble circles

916
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
and there's a reason why you choose that

917
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
because that will give you the minimum surface area

918
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
that whole surface area

919
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
of the soapy fluid material

920
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
between these two

921
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
you've got to make that a minimum

922
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and minimum and you can do it for volume as well

923
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
why is this one a volume

924
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a sphere

925
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
in nature it does that because

926
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
it is a minimum

927
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and some minimum is chosen

928
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and lastly from that

929
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
who will come in this fact

930
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
a plane

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
that has to roll down

932
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
what is going to be the shortest time

933
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
for the ball to roll down

934
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
is it going to be a path that goes straight down

935
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
or is it going to be one of these

936
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
one of these paths

937
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
that is called the brachistochrome

938
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
problem

939
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
brachy which means short chrome

940
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
referring to time, shortest time

941
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
there's a reason why this ball

942
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
will roll down

943
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
will get from there to there faster

944
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
on the ball rolling down that path

945
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
there's a reason for that because nature

946
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
can choose the minimum time

947
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that's what nature does, it wants to choose the minimum time

948
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
to get from there to there

949
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and that is why it will choose a specific path

950
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
that will be the shortest path

951
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
to get down there

952
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
you just have to work out

953
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
an f of x

954
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
for this problem

955
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you
