00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Hi there, so this is a quite interesting video and I think it's very

00:03.200 --> 00:06.800
topical. At the moment of course we get all these results from vaccine trials

00:06.800 --> 00:09.920
and when you read these trials you'll see a lot of them expresses the

00:09.920 --> 00:16.320
efficacy of the vaccine. Now in order for us to determine efficacy we look at the

00:16.320 --> 00:20.040
relative risk. So this video I'm going to show you a notebook, two notebooks in

00:20.040 --> 00:25.360
actual fact. I'm going to use R just to explain the language for

00:25.360 --> 00:29.480
statistical computing just what relative risk is and how we then use it to

00:29.480 --> 00:33.120
calculate efficacy and we're also going to look at a specific trial. In South

00:33.120 --> 00:37.880
Africa there was a small trial as far as the AstraZeneca vaccine was concerned

00:37.880 --> 00:42.440
and it showed very poor efficacy and because of that the vaccine was

00:42.440 --> 00:46.280
withdrawn from South Africa which of course is a very big decision was the

00:46.280 --> 00:49.960
first vaccine it was supposed to go to healthcare workers such as myself and

00:49.960 --> 00:54.560
the vaccine was withdrawn because of the poor showing. So I'm going to show you

00:54.560 --> 00:59.400
how they got to this very bad efficacy level of only 21% and of course

00:59.400 --> 01:03.280
it's not only about that it's about this the confidence intervals around that

01:03.280 --> 01:06.520
efficacy and that's what I want to explain. Now of course with drawing that

01:06.520 --> 01:10.120
was a very difficult decision and it wasn't only the clinical data there was

01:10.120 --> 01:13.520
some data as well and I'll talk a little bit about it about the neutralizing

01:13.520 --> 01:17.880
antibodies etc a lot more went into the decision not to use the AstraZeneca

01:17.880 --> 01:22.160
vaccine in South Africa. So it's all about relative risk and then this video

01:22.160 --> 01:26.800
I'll show you just how a relative risk works how you can calculate it and how

01:26.800 --> 01:32.880
from that we get the efficacy. So here we are on my art pub's website you can

01:32.880 --> 01:37.920
view all the documents that I upload you can view them here and of course the

01:37.920 --> 01:42.080
original the RMD files are available on GitHub and the links to all of these

01:42.080 --> 01:45.720
things will be in the description down below. So we're just going to look at

01:45.720 --> 01:50.240
uncertainty in relative risk. First what is risk what is relative risk and how do

01:50.240 --> 01:54.440
we express uncertainty in that and of course it's very topical with the

01:54.480 --> 02:00.000
vaccines these days in the pandemic and we express the efficacy of these

02:00.000 --> 02:04.040
vaccines. I want to show you just just how to do that. So in this first notebook

02:04.040 --> 02:08.800
we're just going to talk about what risk is and what relative risk is and then

02:08.800 --> 02:12.520
what efficacy is and then how can we express uncertainty just due to

02:12.520 --> 02:19.320
randomness. We do one trial but there is a lot of other trials that if if we could

02:19.320 --> 02:23.320
do it we could do it over and over and over again and this one trial that we

02:23.320 --> 02:29.720
have is just one of the possible outcomes and we need to look at where the

02:29.720 --> 02:35.880
actual efficacy lies and it'll be in some range that we can simulate around

02:35.880 --> 02:42.680
this one this one study that we've done. So let's first have a look at what risk

02:42.680 --> 02:47.320
is and you see there in equation one it's just a number of positive outcomes

02:47.320 --> 02:51.240
divided by the total in the group. Now we've got to talk about what a positive

02:51.240 --> 02:55.720
outcome is and we say positive outcome but it doesn't sentimentally have to be

02:55.720 --> 02:59.600
positive. The outcome can be quite negative and in this instance it might

02:59.600 --> 03:03.880
be well develop the disease and certainly that's not positive but we just

03:03.880 --> 03:07.440
use this term that's the positive outcome that the outcome that we are

03:07.440 --> 03:14.960
interested in and investigating. So if we have a bunch of participants in a

03:14.960 --> 03:19.200
study a certain number of them will develop this positive outcome the

03:19.360 --> 03:22.200
outcome that we're interested in as a set which might be quite a negative thing

03:22.200 --> 03:28.200
but if we just take that ratio that fraction the number of positive outcomes

03:28.200 --> 03:32.920
divided by the total number in the group that is the risk. Now if we've got two

03:32.920 --> 03:38.360
groups one group for instance received a placebo intervention and one group

03:38.360 --> 03:44.280
received a treatment intervention we can just look at this difference in the

03:44.280 --> 03:48.240
risk between the two. So we'll calculate risk as per equation one for both of

03:48.280 --> 03:52.560
them and we just take the difference so the risk in the control minus the risk

03:52.560 --> 03:56.280
in the treatment and what we're assuming here is that the risk in the treatment

03:56.280 --> 04:01.320
will be lower because the other name for risk difference is absolute risk

04:01.320 --> 04:06.000
reduction ARR absolute risk reduction that's just the difference in the risk

04:06.000 --> 04:10.880
and that's a very good way to express a difference in risk between a control

04:10.880 --> 04:14.320
group receiving the placebo and the treatment group getting this active

04:14.360 --> 04:19.200
intervention. So just that difference you've just got to just watch out if the

04:19.200 --> 04:22.560
risk in the treatment ends up being higher than the risk in the control of

04:22.560 --> 04:26.560
course then we cannot talk about absolute risk reduction or we still can't talk

04:26.560 --> 04:29.560
about absolute risk reduction we just got to say that being in the placebo

04:29.560 --> 04:34.160
group gives us a reduction in risk for this positive outcome that we're

04:34.160 --> 04:40.920
talking about. You see there the number needed to treat that is just an equation

04:40.920 --> 04:44.120
three there we're not going to discuss it I've just put that in for you so what

04:44.120 --> 04:50.600
we really want to do is talk about relative risk. You'll see ARR risk ratio

04:50.600 --> 04:56.520
relative risk that is the fraction of the risk of the intervention over the

04:56.520 --> 04:59.760
risk of the control so we worked out the risk in both groups very simple

04:59.760 --> 05:03.520
calculations the positive divided by the total the positive divided by the total

05:03.520 --> 05:11.280
and for these two we'll just we'll just take the ratio. Now what we're hoping

05:11.320 --> 05:16.480
for you of course is that the risk the positive outcomes that fraction will be

05:16.480 --> 05:20.320
lower in the intervention or the treatment group than in the control group

05:20.320 --> 05:26.560
and if that is so this fraction of course will be less than one and if it's

05:26.560 --> 05:31.640
less than one it means the risk is lowered by being in the intervention or

05:31.640 --> 05:37.000
treatment group. So that's when we express this idea of efficacy so let's

05:37.040 --> 05:41.680
imagine here in this piecewise defined function on the top row here for

05:41.680 --> 05:45.200
efficacy that the risk in the treatment group is lower than the risk in the

05:45.200 --> 05:49.240
control group that it was good to develop this because fewer people

05:49.240 --> 05:54.640
fraction wise for the individual groups was lower if you were in the treatment

05:54.640 --> 06:00.560
group than in the control group. That means this relative risk will be less

06:00.560 --> 06:05.400
than one it'll be a fraction of one and what we do is we subtract that relative

06:05.440 --> 06:11.680
risk from one so one minus the relative risk and that gives us the efficacy. Now

06:11.680 --> 06:16.200
I've put the second part in here but we really don't use the second part I just

06:16.200 --> 06:20.960
want it's just to keep your mind or to to simulate your stimulate your mind a

06:20.960 --> 06:25.600
little bit. Imagine that the risk in the treatment was higher then we can't really

06:25.600 --> 06:30.760
talk about efficacy anymore and as much as if this positive outcome was a

06:30.760 --> 06:35.040
negative thing and we want this treatment to lower that risk but now it's

06:35.080 --> 06:39.600
going to increase that risk so we just say relative risk minus one but I warn

06:39.600 --> 06:42.400
you there then we can't really talk about efficacy anymore the efficacy is

06:42.400 --> 06:46.960
really just for that first line one minus the relative risk. So let's look at

06:46.960 --> 06:53.480
some coding examples so we're going to simulate a study we're taking 41,100

06:53.480 --> 07:00.320
people in our study which is when these vaccine trials were developed what is

07:00.320 --> 07:05.640
the power we need to see how many people need to be in there so that we

07:05.640 --> 07:12.240
reach a sufficient power to find the significant difference between the two.

07:12.240 --> 07:18.200
So we say here in our control group there were 20,500 people and in our

07:18.200 --> 07:24.200
treatment group there were 20,600 people and we're saying in this trial

07:24.200 --> 07:28.840
350 people in the control group develop the positive outcome so this is just

07:29.040 --> 07:34.120
thumbs up numbers not from a specific trial and 115 in the treatment group

07:34.120 --> 07:41.080
develop the positive outcome so in the case of a vaccine we have 350 people in

07:41.080 --> 07:45.400
the control group they just received a placebo they developed the disease and

07:45.400 --> 07:51.480
only 115 in the treatment group who got the active vaccine developed the positive

07:51.480 --> 07:55.720
outcome which is developing the disease so we're just saving that also as some

07:55.720 --> 07:58.480
computer variables so we've got a underscore control and a underscore

07:58.480 --> 08:05.840
treatment and if we just divide those 350 divided by 115 that's not something

08:05.840 --> 08:09.120
that we would express but just for interstate then there are three times

08:09.120 --> 08:13.280
more positive cases in the control group than the treatment group now there is no

08:13.280 --> 08:18.360
denominator in here so if I had lots more people in the placebo group then

08:18.360 --> 08:23.560
in the treatment group that value was going to change so that's not a valid

08:23.600 --> 08:28.520
expression really of what is happening here it's just expressing in this nearly

08:28.520 --> 08:33.160
equal groups that we had there were three times more positive cases in the

08:33.160 --> 08:38.200
control group what we're interested though is is the risk so let's see what

08:38.200 --> 08:41.760
the risk in the control group is which I'm going to call risk underscore control

08:41.760 --> 08:48.360
here so that's a that's the control how many got the disease divided by how many

08:48.360 --> 08:53.520
was in the control group so that's going to be the 350 divided by 20,500 and we

08:53.520 --> 08:58.200
see a value of 0.017 now what you would commonly see is this multiplied by a

08:58.200 --> 09:02.680
thousand so you can say that the risk of developing the disease would be if we

09:02.680 --> 09:08.160
multiply that by a thousand the one two three that'll be 17 people per thousand

09:08.160 --> 09:12.760
people so you'll always see that per thousand per ten thousand per hundred

09:12.760 --> 09:18.160
thousand depending on what makes sense now let's do the same for the treatment

09:18.160 --> 09:22.760
group so that's the a underscore treatment that's how many got the disease in

09:22.760 --> 09:26.120
the treatment group and divided by how many there were that's just the risk and

09:26.120 --> 09:31.680
we see a much lower risk here of 0.005 so there'll be five and a half people per

09:31.680 --> 09:37.000
thousand people develop the disease was it the risk then of developing the

09:37.000 --> 09:40.880
disease and now we're just going to do the relative risk so it's the risk of

09:40.880 --> 09:46.400
the treatment of the risk of the control and now we see it's 0.32 multiplied by

09:46.440 --> 09:55.240
100 that's about that's 32.7% so we want to express efficacy though so we're

09:55.240 --> 09:59.600
going to subtract it from one so one minus that one minus the relative risk

09:59.600 --> 10:06.600
and we get the efficacy 67% so we can say the efficacy of this of this vaccine

10:06.600 --> 10:13.160
was 67% and that is how much it lowered the risk really that is what we're

10:13.160 --> 10:20.600
expressing but as I said before that is just one study we did and if we started

10:20.600 --> 10:25.280
a week later we would have had other people in our study if we could do this

10:25.280 --> 10:29.640
over and over again we would get different results every time so this one

10:29.640 --> 10:34.400
result this one efficacy that we found this is one of many possible ones and

10:34.400 --> 10:40.400
what we are interested in is not only this 41,000 100 people in our study we

10:40.400 --> 10:44.560
want to infer these results because it's just a sample on the larger

10:44.560 --> 10:48.720
population so what is the true efficacy in the population as a whole because

10:48.720 --> 10:55.280
eventually we want to inoculate everyone so we need to express a confidence

10:55.280 --> 11:00.560
interval around this efficacy and how do we go about that you know so in

11:00.560 --> 11:05.000
different papers you'll see different methods of doing this there are different

11:05.080 --> 11:11.160
equations for doing this cloper Pearson there's some other ways of doing this as

11:11.160 --> 11:14.760
well but what we're going to do here is something that I like to do and that is

11:14.760 --> 11:21.080
just to do resampling from the results that we found and in that way we're going

11:21.080 --> 11:26.200
to build up simulate a bunch we're going to do a thousand as if we're doing our

11:26.200 --> 11:30.800
study a thousand times over that gives us a distribution of poor possible

11:31.280 --> 11:37.840
efficacies and we can then calculate a 95% confidence interval now remember

11:37.840 --> 11:42.000
what confidence interval means maybe I should keep quiet now when we get to

11:42.000 --> 11:44.960
confidence intervals when we've calculated the confidence intervals I'll

11:44.960 --> 11:50.240
just remind you exactly what that means so here in R we've created a little

11:50.240 --> 11:54.800
function I'm going to call it simulate underscore group it is a function it

11:54.800 --> 12:00.800
takes two parameters n and p now what we're going to do is create this local

12:00.800 --> 12:06.440
variable inside of the function it doesn't exist in the global space so it's

12:06.440 --> 12:13.320
just internal to our function I'm using the our unit function random uniform so

12:13.320 --> 12:16.960
we're going to draw a random number from a uniform distribution a uniform

12:16.960 --> 12:22.960
distribution remember is that every element in the sample space of of this

12:22.960 --> 12:28.120
distribution has an equal likelihood of being chosen at every time we run the

12:28.120 --> 12:35.560
experiment so the random uniform is going to draw from zero to one in that

12:35.560 --> 12:41.140
interval on that interval zero to one it just draws a random value so it will

12:41.140 --> 12:44.680
then throw that value back in the bin so that the next time around we do it that

12:44.680 --> 12:49.320
number is as possible to draw that number again but every value from zero to

12:49.320 --> 12:54.040
one has an equal likelihood of being chosen a uniform distribution it's not

12:54.040 --> 12:57.640
bell shape that certain values are more likely to be chosen at random it's

12:57.640 --> 13:05.400
uniform and now what we're going to do is we're going to look at this number that

13:05.400 --> 13:14.800
is chosen and we're just going to sum them up if that value is less than p the

13:14.800 --> 13:19.080
probability now that p that we're talking about here is actually the

13:19.080 --> 13:23.960
risk remember there were a certain number of people who got the disease

13:23.960 --> 13:29.960
inside of that sample of people and if you think about that that the risk that

13:29.960 --> 13:35.520
is if we do that division the number got positive divided by how many there were

13:35.520 --> 13:40.840
that's in essence a probability of this p that we're talking about here in our

13:40.840 --> 13:45.560
function the parameter that we've called p so we're saying we're going to

13:45.560 --> 13:50.840
simulate this and we're going to say that random person we're just

13:50.840 --> 13:55.560
simulating this random person they get this random value and if that value is

13:55.560 --> 14:01.200
less than this p p value now I'm not talking about a statistical p value not

14:01.200 --> 14:08.240
the famous p value I'm just saying this risk if that was smaller than that when

14:08.240 --> 14:12.880
then we're going to start summing them up and that's a simulation because anyone

14:12.920 --> 14:20.680
can get from from 0 to 1 and this value that was chosen there and we only sum

14:20.680 --> 14:28.120
them up we only sum it up when it is less than the numbers that are come out

14:28.120 --> 14:32.920
less than this p value the risk in action in actual fact and what we're going

14:32.920 --> 14:41.120
to return is this k divided by n the n that we supplied to the function the

14:41.120 --> 14:47.880
sample size so let's let's look at that so I'm storing p now as in this instance

14:47.880 --> 14:50.680
we're going to take the risk in the treatment group so the number got

14:50.680 --> 14:57.040
positive and divided by the total number they were that's our p and now we're

14:57.040 --> 15:01.280
going to run a single simulation so we're just going to say n treatment p and

15:01.280 --> 15:05.920
we just run that and now we have not seeded the seed of random number generator

15:05.920 --> 15:08.920
here so every time you run this code you're going to get a different value but

15:08.920 --> 15:14.640
in this instance I got 0.0055 now we're going to use less comprehension and

15:14.640 --> 15:23.720
you'll see early on this notebook I just I just loaded this comprehend R package

15:23.720 --> 15:29.120
because it contains this function to VEC and it's going to allow us to do less

15:29.120 --> 15:32.760
comprehension on this instance vector comprehension so I'm just going to

15:32.760 --> 15:38.200
simulate this thousand values all in one go so that I just have this vector of a

15:38.200 --> 15:44.680
thousand possible instances I'm going to store that as t so we're just going to

15:44.680 --> 15:49.680
simulate this risk in actual fact over and over and over and over again so

15:49.680 --> 15:54.320
sometimes the value is going to be more than p and it won't be summed and

15:54.320 --> 15:59.360
sometimes it's less than p and it will be summed from what we've done way up

15:59.360 --> 16:03.920
there so if we do that we get these thousand values and we can draw the

16:03.920 --> 16:10.520
sconal density estimate plot and it shows us this distribution of risks

16:10.520 --> 16:16.440
simulated risks there we go for these thousand times as if we could do the

16:16.440 --> 16:21.400
study a thousand times over and there you see the distribution of risk a lot of

16:21.400 --> 16:31.080
them here by 0.05 just over that open of 0.053 there abouts 4 and that was

16:31.080 --> 16:37.440
just simulating that over and over again now one way that we can express this

16:37.440 --> 16:44.520
sort of range of values the measures of dispersion would be standard error and

16:44.520 --> 16:48.600
what we've done here is just to take the standard error that's the standard

16:48.600 --> 16:54.720
deviation of t in this instance and we can see it there and because we've got

16:54.720 --> 17:02.040
this distribution now we can we can calculate the from all these values

17:02.040 --> 17:06.680
these t values we can calculate these cutoff values so for that I'm going to

17:06.680 --> 17:12.920
use the quantile function and I'm just passing that 1000 values to it and I'm

17:12.920 --> 17:18.640
saying calculate for us these intervals that will be 5% cutoff at the bottom

17:18.640 --> 17:23.400
95% cutoff at the top so if you look at this basically it's going to cut

17:23.400 --> 17:30.360
off the bottom 5% and cut off the top 5% and that gives us a 90% confidence

17:30.360 --> 17:37.000
interval then and the values within this thousand values of ours that gave us

17:37.000 --> 17:44.640
that was 0.00475 to 0.0064 so then we're saying a 90% confidence interval

17:44.640 --> 17:55.840
around this around this risk of ours the mean risk was going to be these values

17:55.840 --> 18:00.560
so you're not necessarily interested in this single one we want the relative

18:00.560 --> 18:06.960
risk so we're going to create another little equation here another function I

18:06.960 --> 18:10.980
should say and it's just going to do what we've done before twice for the

18:10.980 --> 18:14.440
control group and for the treatment group this time so that we can have this

18:14.440 --> 18:21.880
efficacy as 1 minus the relative risk risk 2 that's going to be the treatment

18:21.880 --> 18:25.240
divided by risk 1 which is going to be the control so we've got to pass four

18:25.240 --> 18:30.480
parameters there so the p-value that we are going to ask for it to count below

18:30.480 --> 18:36.240
as the p1 will be the controls risk and the p2 will be the treatment arms risk

18:36.240 --> 18:41.920
and then we just simulate that once and it'll give us back one possible

18:41.920 --> 18:49.360
efficacy 65.9% now again using this two-vec function I'm going to create

18:49.360 --> 18:55.120
this vector of a thousand efficacies all in one go calling this function of our

18:55.120 --> 19:00.720
simulate trial and the simulate trial remember it calls the simulate underscore

19:00.720 --> 19:07.680
group function twice one for each of these two groups of ours and if we plot

19:07.680 --> 19:13.240
the kernel density estimate there we see that we have this range of values

19:13.240 --> 19:18.480
possible values we just simulated so we've resampled based on this finding

19:18.480 --> 19:23.640
that we had for this specific study and then we see the mean efficacy of the

19:23.640 --> 19:28.800
1000 simulator trials was 0.67 our actual one was also 0.67 that's where it's

19:28.800 --> 19:33.840
going to work out so if we want a 90% confidence interval for that we just

19:33.840 --> 19:39.040
pass those thousand values to the quantile function and we set a probability

19:39.040 --> 19:45.080
cut off the bottom 5% the top 5% what were the values within T2 which is where

19:45.080 --> 19:51.360
we saved a thousand values would be 60.8 to 72.7 so we can say the

19:51.360 --> 19:57.280
efficacy of this study for this drug or this vaccine was 67% 90 or 90%

19:57.280 --> 20:07.280
confidence intervals 60 to 72 or about 61% to about 73% so that's 90% confidence

20:07.280 --> 20:11.200
intervals and now let me just remind you what confidence intervals is we're not

20:11.200 --> 20:16.520
saying that we are 90% confident that in the globe as a whole if we gave it to

20:16.520 --> 20:21.760
everyone and that we are 90 it's not to say that we're 90% sure that the true

20:21.760 --> 20:25.760
efficacy in the world population as a whole will be this no that's not what

20:25.760 --> 20:32.080
it means it means if we ran the study 100 times over just imagine what that

20:32.080 --> 20:35.560
would cost now long that would take but if we ran it a hundred times over every

20:35.560 --> 20:39.320
time we're going to get slightly different confidence intervals in 90% of

20:39.320 --> 20:47.720
those the true population will be true population efficacy will be within the

20:47.720 --> 20:52.200
confidence intervals that we set so we're not saying that's true for the

20:52.200 --> 20:57.360
specific one is if we could do it hundred times over in 90 of them 90 of

20:57.360 --> 21:05.080
them will capture within its bounds the true population efficacy now that we've

21:05.080 --> 21:08.640
done that let's go and see this trial that was done in South Africa with

21:08.640 --> 21:14.320
AstraZeneca trial and now this trial I'm going to warn you I mean from the time

21:14.320 --> 21:18.840
of this recording it's just on as a available the pre-printed was not not

21:18.880 --> 21:24.600
accepted by a journal yet not peer reviewed yet and on the space on the

21:24.600 --> 21:30.480
evidence of this very small study the the vaccine was withdrawn from South

21:30.480 --> 21:34.080
Africa so there was about a million doses available this was the first

21:34.080 --> 21:39.800
doses of any vaccine to land in South Africa it was ready to be distributed

21:39.800 --> 21:46.120
amongst health care workers and it got pulled on the strength of the study now

21:46.120 --> 21:49.920
the study has more than one component so what we're going to look at is just a

21:49.920 --> 21:54.280
clinical side of it looking at the relative risk and the efficacy but it

21:54.280 --> 21:58.640
was also about it was about more than that there was part of the analysis was

21:58.640 --> 22:03.760
also on the neutralizing antibodies and whether they could were effective against

22:03.760 --> 22:09.000
the variant that's prevalent within South Africa so it's not just based on

22:09.000 --> 22:15.960
this but I want to show you what the what relative risk does in efficacy what

22:15.960 --> 22:21.520
it would look like at least the uncertainty in the value when we're

22:21.520 --> 22:25.240
dealing with a small trial and how difficult it becomes in a small trial

22:25.240 --> 22:30.760
where the risk is relatively low so let's look at that so you can click on

22:30.760 --> 22:35.960
the link there to find the pre-print of this article and there were some

22:35.960 --> 22:39.680
important points so the primary endpoint and I've just listed them here the

22:39.680 --> 22:46.960
primary endpoint was this efficacy of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 more than

22:46.960 --> 22:52.080
14 days after the second dose so waited 14 days after the second dose then start

22:52.080 --> 22:59.360
looking at whether people develop confirmed symptomatic COVID so the

22:59.360 --> 23:04.400
primary for the primary efficacy analysis only per perperatical seronegative

23:04.440 --> 23:10.400
participants were included and the vex vaccine efficacy VE was calculated as 1

23:10.400 --> 23:14.080
minus the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated

23:14.080 --> 23:18.320
using the clopper Pearson exact method as reported so that's not what we're doing

23:18.320 --> 23:23.960
we are using resampling which is what I like to do there's a bunch of these

23:23.960 --> 23:28.480
tests and they have their strengths and weaknesses and debate about you know

23:28.480 --> 23:33.280
whether they work or not and when they should be used and when not my feeling

23:33.280 --> 23:38.000
on the matter use use resampling so whether a thousand and ten participants

23:38.000 --> 23:42.920
received vaccine and a thousand and eleven received placebo and in the end

23:42.920 --> 23:48.040
there was a lot of exclusions you can read the papers to why in the end though

23:48.040 --> 23:54.760
remember our simulated study before had over 40,000 people in them 20,000 more

23:54.760 --> 23:59.280
than 20,000 each arm yeah there was only 715 in the vaccine group there was

23:59.280 --> 24:08.200
analyzed and 750 vaccine and 717 in the placebo group so very small now and

24:08.200 --> 24:13.160
other problems with the trial and I don't say that's problems the trial does

24:13.160 --> 24:18.440
correctly done is this we want to infer that to a larger population the

24:18.440 --> 24:22.920
population out there and of course the participants in the study were not

24:22.920 --> 24:27.560
representative of the population as a whole it was only representative of

24:27.840 --> 24:33.680
certain people in the population because the median age was very young was only

24:33.680 --> 24:40.560
31 years 56 and a half percent were male and then there was a racial

24:40.560 --> 24:46.560
distribution as well all 42 endpoint cases were graded as either mild or

24:46.560 --> 24:52.160
moderate so there were no severe cases following this trial so even in the

24:52.160 --> 24:58.480
placebo group there was no severe cases and we can see in the vaccine group

24:58.480 --> 25:08.480
15 mild and 4 moderate and then 17 mild and 6 moderate so there are no cases of

25:08.480 --> 25:12.520
severe disease or hospitalization in either arm so that makes it very

25:12.520 --> 25:18.160
difficult because half of these people receive placebo to infer the results to

25:18.160 --> 25:24.600
the larger population so let's just see how they you know if we do the relative

25:24.600 --> 25:29.760
risk and we look specifically at the uncertainty around the relative risk

25:29.760 --> 25:34.440
that's what this is all about so there was 717 in the control group 750 in the

25:34.440 --> 25:40.600
treatment group 17 plus 6 that's the mild plus moderate got the disease in the

25:40.600 --> 25:46.120
control group and 15 plus 4 that's in the treatment group so we're gonna work

25:46.120 --> 25:50.440
out the risk in the control group which is just that very simple ratio and the

25:50.440 --> 25:54.920
risk in the treatment group so that we can express the relative risk and the

25:54.920 --> 25:58.800
relative risk as you can see there that was lower than one so we subtracted

25:58.800 --> 26:03.160
from one and we get the efficacy and that was the headline it was only 21%

26:03.160 --> 26:10.720
effective only 21% effective and of course mostly you'll see that we're

26:10.720 --> 26:15.480
looking for at least 50% efficacy in these but here comes the problem we need

26:15.520 --> 26:22.440
to express our uncertainty in this 21% efficacy and so again we're going to

26:22.440 --> 26:26.160
create our two functions the one that just simulates again from a random

26:26.160 --> 26:30.440
uniform distribution just as we did before only counting those that was

26:30.440 --> 26:36.360
lower than this risk value and then we're going to simulate it at the two

26:36.360 --> 26:43.600
risks and we express the efficacy again as one minus the risk two over risk one

26:43.640 --> 26:48.000
so risk of the treatment divided by risk of the control group and our P values

26:48.000 --> 26:53.200
again remember that just taken from the outcome of this actual study the two

26:53.200 --> 26:57.080
risks and then we're going to simulate it and I've run a simulation just this

26:57.080 --> 27:05.520
once and we get a negative value we get a negative value and now this becomes

27:05.520 --> 27:09.200
very difficult to interpret and let me show you why because now we're going to

27:09.200 --> 27:14.000
simulate it a thousand times using this two-vec function so we can do list or

27:14.000 --> 27:18.560
vector comprehension so in one go we get our thousand values and here I've used

27:18.560 --> 27:24.880
plotly and not the inbuilt r plotting so we can see here this distribution around

27:24.880 --> 27:33.320
the around the efficacy and you can see how it tails off below zero now how do

27:33.320 --> 27:36.800
we interpret that so I leave that for you in the comments to interpret that

27:37.200 --> 27:41.160
because if you think about it we're actually back in the real or realm of

27:41.160 --> 27:47.320
the vaccine actually increasing the risk okay and that's the way that their

27:47.320 --> 27:53.320
values are going to come out and you can see this bump here right at the top it

27:53.320 --> 28:02.800
is at about about 21, 22, 23 percent the efficacy and what we

28:02.800 --> 28:07.680
interested now is the 95% confidence intervals so we said the efficacy of

28:07.680 --> 28:14.320
this study of the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 21 percent and now you see the

28:14.320 --> 28:25.400
95% confidence intervals around that from negative 50% to about 59% so it's

28:25.400 --> 28:32.080
quite possible that the efficacy of this efficacy out in the population just

28:32.080 --> 28:35.440
based on the study that the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine out in the

28:35.440 --> 28:40.600
population is somewhere between there so this is bizarre on this side of course

28:40.600 --> 28:45.040
and as I say leave your thoughts in the comment what this negative values would

28:45.040 --> 28:52.240
really be but this is we're still within the 95% confidence intervals almost 60%

28:52.240 --> 28:58.480
efficacy of the AstraZeneca so very difficult to make decisions based on a

28:58.480 --> 29:06.520
small study like this where our risk is very low the risk was very low for

29:06.520 --> 29:12.160
someone to develop the disease both in the placebo arm and in the treatment arm

29:12.160 --> 29:19.440
and the efficacy they've the two risks were very close to each other meaning

29:19.440 --> 29:24.400
the efficacy was only 21% because these values are so small and we simulate a

29:24.480 --> 29:29.120
thousand of these when we express our uncertainty in this 21% you see that

29:29.120 --> 29:35.280
this uncertainty is quite big and as I say this the idea behind the study was

29:35.280 --> 29:37.960
not only looking at this to make the decision to withdraw the use of the

29:37.960 --> 29:41.800
vaccine that's AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa because a part of the study

29:41.800 --> 29:46.720
was also about neutralizing antibodies etc there's a whole other parts to that

29:46.720 --> 29:51.520
but see how difficult it is or how difficult it can be if you've got

29:51.560 --> 29:56.880
relatively small sample sizes and the risk is also small then you are going to

29:56.880 --> 30:03.160
struggle to make a decision because your uncertainty in your efficacy is not

30:03.160 --> 30:07.720
going to be very good there's going to be a wide confidence interval in the

30:07.720 --> 30:11.680
efficacy so I hope this was interesting for you leave some comments down below

30:11.680 --> 30:19.000
remember to like the video you can read this these notebooks here on our pubs

30:19.280 --> 30:24.680
or follow the link down below to download the RMD files the our markdown files if

30:24.680 --> 30:28.800
you've got our studio you can just import that and you can play around with

30:28.800 --> 30:35.400
these values maybe simulate some more draw some pretty graphs etc and I hope

30:35.400 --> 30:39.960
this really helped you to understand the idea a very relevant example of

30:39.960 --> 30:44.600
understanding relative risk and efficacy

30:49.000 --> 30:51.060
