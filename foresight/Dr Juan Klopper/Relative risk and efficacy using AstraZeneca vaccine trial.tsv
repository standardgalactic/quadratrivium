0	3200	Hi there, so this is a quite interesting video and I think it's very
3200	6800	topical. At the moment of course we get all these results from vaccine trials
6800	9920	and when you read these trials you'll see a lot of them expresses the
9920	16320	efficacy of the vaccine. Now in order for us to determine efficacy we look at the
16320	20040	relative risk. So this video I'm going to show you a notebook, two notebooks in
20040	25360	actual fact. I'm going to use R just to explain the language for
25360	29480	statistical computing just what relative risk is and how we then use it to
29480	33120	calculate efficacy and we're also going to look at a specific trial. In South
33120	37880	Africa there was a small trial as far as the AstraZeneca vaccine was concerned
37880	42440	and it showed very poor efficacy and because of that the vaccine was
42440	46280	withdrawn from South Africa which of course is a very big decision was the
46280	49960	first vaccine it was supposed to go to healthcare workers such as myself and
49960	54560	the vaccine was withdrawn because of the poor showing. So I'm going to show you
54560	59400	how they got to this very bad efficacy level of only 21% and of course
59400	63280	it's not only about that it's about this the confidence intervals around that
63280	66520	efficacy and that's what I want to explain. Now of course with drawing that
66520	70120	was a very difficult decision and it wasn't only the clinical data there was
70120	73520	some data as well and I'll talk a little bit about it about the neutralizing
73520	77880	antibodies etc a lot more went into the decision not to use the AstraZeneca
77880	82160	vaccine in South Africa. So it's all about relative risk and then this video
82160	86800	I'll show you just how a relative risk works how you can calculate it and how
86800	92880	from that we get the efficacy. So here we are on my art pub's website you can
92880	97920	view all the documents that I upload you can view them here and of course the
97920	102080	original the RMD files are available on GitHub and the links to all of these
102080	105720	things will be in the description down below. So we're just going to look at
105720	110240	uncertainty in relative risk. First what is risk what is relative risk and how do
110240	114440	we express uncertainty in that and of course it's very topical with the
114480	120000	vaccines these days in the pandemic and we express the efficacy of these
120000	124040	vaccines. I want to show you just just how to do that. So in this first notebook
124040	128800	we're just going to talk about what risk is and what relative risk is and then
128800	132520	what efficacy is and then how can we express uncertainty just due to
132520	139320	randomness. We do one trial but there is a lot of other trials that if if we could
139320	143320	do it we could do it over and over and over again and this one trial that we
143320	149720	have is just one of the possible outcomes and we need to look at where the
149720	155880	actual efficacy lies and it'll be in some range that we can simulate around
155880	162680	this one this one study that we've done. So let's first have a look at what risk
162680	167320	is and you see there in equation one it's just a number of positive outcomes
167320	171240	divided by the total in the group. Now we've got to talk about what a positive
171240	175720	outcome is and we say positive outcome but it doesn't sentimentally have to be
175720	179600	positive. The outcome can be quite negative and in this instance it might
179600	183880	be well develop the disease and certainly that's not positive but we just
183880	187440	use this term that's the positive outcome that the outcome that we are
187440	194960	interested in and investigating. So if we have a bunch of participants in a
194960	199200	study a certain number of them will develop this positive outcome the
199360	202200	outcome that we're interested in as a set which might be quite a negative thing
202200	208200	but if we just take that ratio that fraction the number of positive outcomes
208200	212920	divided by the total number in the group that is the risk. Now if we've got two
212920	218360	groups one group for instance received a placebo intervention and one group
218360	224280	received a treatment intervention we can just look at this difference in the
224280	228240	risk between the two. So we'll calculate risk as per equation one for both of
228280	232560	them and we just take the difference so the risk in the control minus the risk
232560	236280	in the treatment and what we're assuming here is that the risk in the treatment
236280	241320	will be lower because the other name for risk difference is absolute risk
241320	246000	reduction ARR absolute risk reduction that's just the difference in the risk
246000	250880	and that's a very good way to express a difference in risk between a control
250880	254320	group receiving the placebo and the treatment group getting this active
254360	259200	intervention. So just that difference you've just got to just watch out if the
259200	262560	risk in the treatment ends up being higher than the risk in the control of
262560	266560	course then we cannot talk about absolute risk reduction or we still can't talk
266560	269560	about absolute risk reduction we just got to say that being in the placebo
269560	274160	group gives us a reduction in risk for this positive outcome that we're
274160	280920	talking about. You see there the number needed to treat that is just an equation
280920	284120	three there we're not going to discuss it I've just put that in for you so what
284120	290600	we really want to do is talk about relative risk. You'll see ARR risk ratio
290600	296520	relative risk that is the fraction of the risk of the intervention over the
296520	299760	risk of the control so we worked out the risk in both groups very simple
299760	303520	calculations the positive divided by the total the positive divided by the total
303520	311280	and for these two we'll just we'll just take the ratio. Now what we're hoping
311320	316480	for you of course is that the risk the positive outcomes that fraction will be
316480	320320	lower in the intervention or the treatment group than in the control group
320320	326560	and if that is so this fraction of course will be less than one and if it's
326560	331640	less than one it means the risk is lowered by being in the intervention or
331640	337000	treatment group. So that's when we express this idea of efficacy so let's
337040	341680	imagine here in this piecewise defined function on the top row here for
341680	345200	efficacy that the risk in the treatment group is lower than the risk in the
345200	349240	control group that it was good to develop this because fewer people
349240	354640	fraction wise for the individual groups was lower if you were in the treatment
354640	360560	group than in the control group. That means this relative risk will be less
360560	365400	than one it'll be a fraction of one and what we do is we subtract that relative
365440	371680	risk from one so one minus the relative risk and that gives us the efficacy. Now
371680	376200	I've put the second part in here but we really don't use the second part I just
376200	380960	want it's just to keep your mind or to to simulate your stimulate your mind a
380960	385600	little bit. Imagine that the risk in the treatment was higher then we can't really
385600	390760	talk about efficacy anymore and as much as if this positive outcome was a
390760	395040	negative thing and we want this treatment to lower that risk but now it's
395080	399600	going to increase that risk so we just say relative risk minus one but I warn
399600	402400	you there then we can't really talk about efficacy anymore the efficacy is
402400	406960	really just for that first line one minus the relative risk. So let's look at
406960	413480	some coding examples so we're going to simulate a study we're taking 41,100
413480	420320	people in our study which is when these vaccine trials were developed what is
420320	425640	the power we need to see how many people need to be in there so that we
425640	432240	reach a sufficient power to find the significant difference between the two.
432240	438200	So we say here in our control group there were 20,500 people and in our
438200	444200	treatment group there were 20,600 people and we're saying in this trial
444200	448840	350 people in the control group develop the positive outcome so this is just
449040	454120	thumbs up numbers not from a specific trial and 115 in the treatment group
454120	461080	develop the positive outcome so in the case of a vaccine we have 350 people in
461080	465400	the control group they just received a placebo they developed the disease and
465400	471480	only 115 in the treatment group who got the active vaccine developed the positive
471480	475720	outcome which is developing the disease so we're just saving that also as some
475720	478480	computer variables so we've got a underscore control and a underscore
478480	485840	treatment and if we just divide those 350 divided by 115 that's not something
485840	489120	that we would express but just for interstate then there are three times
489120	493280	more positive cases in the control group than the treatment group now there is no
493280	498360	denominator in here so if I had lots more people in the placebo group then
498360	503560	in the treatment group that value was going to change so that's not a valid
503600	508520	expression really of what is happening here it's just expressing in this nearly
508520	513160	equal groups that we had there were three times more positive cases in the
513160	518200	control group what we're interested though is is the risk so let's see what
518200	521760	the risk in the control group is which I'm going to call risk underscore control
521760	528360	here so that's a that's the control how many got the disease divided by how many
528360	533520	was in the control group so that's going to be the 350 divided by 20,500 and we
533520	538200	see a value of 0.017 now what you would commonly see is this multiplied by a
538200	542680	thousand so you can say that the risk of developing the disease would be if we
542680	548160	multiply that by a thousand the one two three that'll be 17 people per thousand
548160	552760	people so you'll always see that per thousand per ten thousand per hundred
552760	558160	thousand depending on what makes sense now let's do the same for the treatment
558160	562760	group so that's the a underscore treatment that's how many got the disease in
562760	566120	the treatment group and divided by how many there were that's just the risk and
566120	571680	we see a much lower risk here of 0.005 so there'll be five and a half people per
571680	577000	thousand people develop the disease was it the risk then of developing the
577000	580880	disease and now we're just going to do the relative risk so it's the risk of
580880	586400	the treatment of the risk of the control and now we see it's 0.32 multiplied by
586440	595240	100 that's about that's 32.7% so we want to express efficacy though so we're
595240	599600	going to subtract it from one so one minus that one minus the relative risk
599600	606600	and we get the efficacy 67% so we can say the efficacy of this of this vaccine
606600	613160	was 67% and that is how much it lowered the risk really that is what we're
613160	620600	expressing but as I said before that is just one study we did and if we started
620600	625280	a week later we would have had other people in our study if we could do this
625280	629640	over and over again we would get different results every time so this one
629640	634400	result this one efficacy that we found this is one of many possible ones and
634400	640400	what we are interested in is not only this 41,000 100 people in our study we
640400	644560	want to infer these results because it's just a sample on the larger
644560	648720	population so what is the true efficacy in the population as a whole because
648720	655280	eventually we want to inoculate everyone so we need to express a confidence
655280	660560	interval around this efficacy and how do we go about that you know so in
660560	665000	different papers you'll see different methods of doing this there are different
665080	671160	equations for doing this cloper Pearson there's some other ways of doing this as
671160	674760	well but what we're going to do here is something that I like to do and that is
674760	681080	just to do resampling from the results that we found and in that way we're going
681080	686200	to build up simulate a bunch we're going to do a thousand as if we're doing our
686200	690800	study a thousand times over that gives us a distribution of poor possible
691280	697840	efficacies and we can then calculate a 95% confidence interval now remember
697840	702000	what confidence interval means maybe I should keep quiet now when we get to
702000	704960	confidence intervals when we've calculated the confidence intervals I'll
704960	710240	just remind you exactly what that means so here in R we've created a little
710240	714800	function I'm going to call it simulate underscore group it is a function it
714800	720800	takes two parameters n and p now what we're going to do is create this local
720800	726440	variable inside of the function it doesn't exist in the global space so it's
726440	733320	just internal to our function I'm using the our unit function random uniform so
733320	736960	we're going to draw a random number from a uniform distribution a uniform
736960	742960	distribution remember is that every element in the sample space of of this
742960	748120	distribution has an equal likelihood of being chosen at every time we run the
748120	755560	experiment so the random uniform is going to draw from zero to one in that
755560	761140	interval on that interval zero to one it just draws a random value so it will
761140	764680	then throw that value back in the bin so that the next time around we do it that
764680	769320	number is as possible to draw that number again but every value from zero to
769320	774040	one has an equal likelihood of being chosen a uniform distribution it's not
774040	777640	bell shape that certain values are more likely to be chosen at random it's
777640	785400	uniform and now what we're going to do is we're going to look at this number that
785400	794800	is chosen and we're just going to sum them up if that value is less than p the
794800	799080	probability now that p that we're talking about here is actually the
799080	803960	risk remember there were a certain number of people who got the disease
803960	809960	inside of that sample of people and if you think about that that the risk that
809960	815520	is if we do that division the number got positive divided by how many there were
815520	820840	that's in essence a probability of this p that we're talking about here in our
820840	825560	function the parameter that we've called p so we're saying we're going to
825560	830840	simulate this and we're going to say that random person we're just
830840	835560	simulating this random person they get this random value and if that value is
835560	841200	less than this p p value now I'm not talking about a statistical p value not
841200	848240	the famous p value I'm just saying this risk if that was smaller than that when
848240	852880	then we're going to start summing them up and that's a simulation because anyone
852920	860680	can get from from 0 to 1 and this value that was chosen there and we only sum
860680	868120	them up we only sum it up when it is less than the numbers that are come out
868120	872920	less than this p value the risk in action in actual fact and what we're going
872920	881120	to return is this k divided by n the n that we supplied to the function the
881120	887880	sample size so let's let's look at that so I'm storing p now as in this instance
887880	890680	we're going to take the risk in the treatment group so the number got
890680	897040	positive and divided by the total number they were that's our p and now we're
897040	901280	going to run a single simulation so we're just going to say n treatment p and
901280	905920	we just run that and now we have not seeded the seed of random number generator
905920	908920	here so every time you run this code you're going to get a different value but
908920	914640	in this instance I got 0.0055 now we're going to use less comprehension and
914640	923720	you'll see early on this notebook I just I just loaded this comprehend R package
923720	929120	because it contains this function to VEC and it's going to allow us to do less
929120	932760	comprehension on this instance vector comprehension so I'm just going to
932760	938200	simulate this thousand values all in one go so that I just have this vector of a
938200	944680	thousand possible instances I'm going to store that as t so we're just going to
944680	949680	simulate this risk in actual fact over and over and over and over again so
949680	954320	sometimes the value is going to be more than p and it won't be summed and
954320	959360	sometimes it's less than p and it will be summed from what we've done way up
959360	963920	there so if we do that we get these thousand values and we can draw the
963920	970520	sconal density estimate plot and it shows us this distribution of risks
970520	976440	simulated risks there we go for these thousand times as if we could do the
976440	981400	study a thousand times over and there you see the distribution of risk a lot of
981400	991080	them here by 0.05 just over that open of 0.053 there abouts 4 and that was
991080	997440	just simulating that over and over again now one way that we can express this
997440	1004520	sort of range of values the measures of dispersion would be standard error and
1004520	1008600	what we've done here is just to take the standard error that's the standard
1008600	1014720	deviation of t in this instance and we can see it there and because we've got
1014720	1022040	this distribution now we can we can calculate the from all these values
1022040	1026680	these t values we can calculate these cutoff values so for that I'm going to
1026680	1032920	use the quantile function and I'm just passing that 1000 values to it and I'm
1032920	1038640	saying calculate for us these intervals that will be 5% cutoff at the bottom
1038640	1043400	95% cutoff at the top so if you look at this basically it's going to cut
1043400	1050360	off the bottom 5% and cut off the top 5% and that gives us a 90% confidence
1050360	1057000	interval then and the values within this thousand values of ours that gave us
1057000	1064640	that was 0.00475 to 0.0064 so then we're saying a 90% confidence interval
1064640	1075840	around this around this risk of ours the mean risk was going to be these values
1075840	1080560	so you're not necessarily interested in this single one we want the relative
1080560	1086960	risk so we're going to create another little equation here another function I
1086960	1090980	should say and it's just going to do what we've done before twice for the
1090980	1094440	control group and for the treatment group this time so that we can have this
1094440	1101880	efficacy as 1 minus the relative risk risk 2 that's going to be the treatment
1101880	1105240	divided by risk 1 which is going to be the control so we've got to pass four
1105240	1110480	parameters there so the p-value that we are going to ask for it to count below
1110480	1116240	as the p1 will be the controls risk and the p2 will be the treatment arms risk
1116240	1121920	and then we just simulate that once and it'll give us back one possible
1121920	1129360	efficacy 65.9% now again using this two-vec function I'm going to create
1129360	1135120	this vector of a thousand efficacies all in one go calling this function of our
1135120	1140720	simulate trial and the simulate trial remember it calls the simulate underscore
1140720	1147680	group function twice one for each of these two groups of ours and if we plot
1147680	1153240	the kernel density estimate there we see that we have this range of values
1153240	1158480	possible values we just simulated so we've resampled based on this finding
1158480	1163640	that we had for this specific study and then we see the mean efficacy of the
1163640	1168800	1000 simulator trials was 0.67 our actual one was also 0.67 that's where it's
1168800	1173840	going to work out so if we want a 90% confidence interval for that we just
1173840	1179040	pass those thousand values to the quantile function and we set a probability
1179040	1185080	cut off the bottom 5% the top 5% what were the values within T2 which is where
1185080	1191360	we saved a thousand values would be 60.8 to 72.7 so we can say the
1191360	1197280	efficacy of this study for this drug or this vaccine was 67% 90 or 90%
1197280	1207280	confidence intervals 60 to 72 or about 61% to about 73% so that's 90% confidence
1207280	1211200	intervals and now let me just remind you what confidence intervals is we're not
1211200	1216520	saying that we are 90% confident that in the globe as a whole if we gave it to
1216520	1221760	everyone and that we are 90 it's not to say that we're 90% sure that the true
1221760	1225760	efficacy in the world population as a whole will be this no that's not what
1225760	1232080	it means it means if we ran the study 100 times over just imagine what that
1232080	1235560	would cost now long that would take but if we ran it a hundred times over every
1235560	1239320	time we're going to get slightly different confidence intervals in 90% of
1239320	1247720	those the true population will be true population efficacy will be within the
1247720	1252200	confidence intervals that we set so we're not saying that's true for the
1252200	1257360	specific one is if we could do it hundred times over in 90 of them 90 of
1257360	1265080	them will capture within its bounds the true population efficacy now that we've
1265080	1268640	done that let's go and see this trial that was done in South Africa with
1268640	1274320	AstraZeneca trial and now this trial I'm going to warn you I mean from the time
1274320	1278840	of this recording it's just on as a available the pre-printed was not not
1278880	1284600	accepted by a journal yet not peer reviewed yet and on the space on the
1284600	1290480	evidence of this very small study the the vaccine was withdrawn from South
1290480	1294080	Africa so there was about a million doses available this was the first
1294080	1299800	doses of any vaccine to land in South Africa it was ready to be distributed
1299800	1306120	amongst health care workers and it got pulled on the strength of the study now
1306120	1309920	the study has more than one component so what we're going to look at is just a
1309920	1314280	clinical side of it looking at the relative risk and the efficacy but it
1314280	1318640	was also about it was about more than that there was part of the analysis was
1318640	1323760	also on the neutralizing antibodies and whether they could were effective against
1323760	1329000	the variant that's prevalent within South Africa so it's not just based on
1329000	1335960	this but I want to show you what the what relative risk does in efficacy what
1335960	1341520	it would look like at least the uncertainty in the value when we're
1341520	1345240	dealing with a small trial and how difficult it becomes in a small trial
1345240	1350760	where the risk is relatively low so let's look at that so you can click on
1350760	1355960	the link there to find the pre-print of this article and there were some
1355960	1359680	important points so the primary endpoint and I've just listed them here the
1359680	1366960	primary endpoint was this efficacy of confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 more than
1366960	1372080	14 days after the second dose so waited 14 days after the second dose then start
1372080	1379360	looking at whether people develop confirmed symptomatic COVID so the
1379360	1384400	primary for the primary efficacy analysis only per perperatical seronegative
1384440	1390400	participants were included and the vex vaccine efficacy VE was calculated as 1
1390400	1394080	minus the relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated
1394080	1398320	using the clopper Pearson exact method as reported so that's not what we're doing
1398320	1403960	we are using resampling which is what I like to do there's a bunch of these
1403960	1408480	tests and they have their strengths and weaknesses and debate about you know
1408480	1413280	whether they work or not and when they should be used and when not my feeling
1413280	1418000	on the matter use use resampling so whether a thousand and ten participants
1418000	1422920	received vaccine and a thousand and eleven received placebo and in the end
1422920	1428040	there was a lot of exclusions you can read the papers to why in the end though
1428040	1434760	remember our simulated study before had over 40,000 people in them 20,000 more
1434760	1439280	than 20,000 each arm yeah there was only 715 in the vaccine group there was
1439280	1448200	analyzed and 750 vaccine and 717 in the placebo group so very small now and
1448200	1453160	other problems with the trial and I don't say that's problems the trial does
1453160	1458440	correctly done is this we want to infer that to a larger population the
1458440	1462920	population out there and of course the participants in the study were not
1462920	1467560	representative of the population as a whole it was only representative of
1467840	1473680	certain people in the population because the median age was very young was only
1473680	1480560	31 years 56 and a half percent were male and then there was a racial
1480560	1486560	distribution as well all 42 endpoint cases were graded as either mild or
1486560	1492160	moderate so there were no severe cases following this trial so even in the
1492160	1498480	placebo group there was no severe cases and we can see in the vaccine group
1498480	1508480	15 mild and 4 moderate and then 17 mild and 6 moderate so there are no cases of
1508480	1512520	severe disease or hospitalization in either arm so that makes it very
1512520	1518160	difficult because half of these people receive placebo to infer the results to
1518160	1524600	the larger population so let's just see how they you know if we do the relative
1524600	1529760	risk and we look specifically at the uncertainty around the relative risk
1529760	1534440	that's what this is all about so there was 717 in the control group 750 in the
1534440	1540600	treatment group 17 plus 6 that's the mild plus moderate got the disease in the
1540600	1546120	control group and 15 plus 4 that's in the treatment group so we're gonna work
1546120	1550440	out the risk in the control group which is just that very simple ratio and the
1550440	1554920	risk in the treatment group so that we can express the relative risk and the
1554920	1558800	relative risk as you can see there that was lower than one so we subtracted
1558800	1563160	from one and we get the efficacy and that was the headline it was only 21%
1563160	1570720	effective only 21% effective and of course mostly you'll see that we're
1570720	1575480	looking for at least 50% efficacy in these but here comes the problem we need
1575520	1582440	to express our uncertainty in this 21% efficacy and so again we're going to
1582440	1586160	create our two functions the one that just simulates again from a random
1586160	1590440	uniform distribution just as we did before only counting those that was
1590440	1596360	lower than this risk value and then we're going to simulate it at the two
1596360	1603600	risks and we express the efficacy again as one minus the risk two over risk one
1603640	1608000	so risk of the treatment divided by risk of the control group and our P values
1608000	1613200	again remember that just taken from the outcome of this actual study the two
1613200	1617080	risks and then we're going to simulate it and I've run a simulation just this
1617080	1625520	once and we get a negative value we get a negative value and now this becomes
1625520	1629200	very difficult to interpret and let me show you why because now we're going to
1629200	1634000	simulate it a thousand times using this two-vec function so we can do list or
1634000	1638560	vector comprehension so in one go we get our thousand values and here I've used
1638560	1644880	plotly and not the inbuilt r plotting so we can see here this distribution around
1644880	1653320	the around the efficacy and you can see how it tails off below zero now how do
1653320	1656800	we interpret that so I leave that for you in the comments to interpret that
1657200	1661160	because if you think about it we're actually back in the real or realm of
1661160	1667320	the vaccine actually increasing the risk okay and that's the way that their
1667320	1673320	values are going to come out and you can see this bump here right at the top it
1673320	1682800	is at about about 21, 22, 23 percent the efficacy and what we
1682800	1687680	interested now is the 95% confidence intervals so we said the efficacy of
1687680	1694320	this study of the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 21 percent and now you see the
1694320	1705400	95% confidence intervals around that from negative 50% to about 59% so it's
1705400	1712080	quite possible that the efficacy of this efficacy out in the population just
1712080	1715440	based on the study that the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine out in the
1715440	1720600	population is somewhere between there so this is bizarre on this side of course
1720600	1725040	and as I say leave your thoughts in the comment what this negative values would
1725040	1732240	really be but this is we're still within the 95% confidence intervals almost 60%
1732240	1738480	efficacy of the AstraZeneca so very difficult to make decisions based on a
1738480	1746520	small study like this where our risk is very low the risk was very low for
1746520	1752160	someone to develop the disease both in the placebo arm and in the treatment arm
1752160	1759440	and the efficacy they've the two risks were very close to each other meaning
1759440	1764400	the efficacy was only 21% because these values are so small and we simulate a
1764480	1769120	thousand of these when we express our uncertainty in this 21% you see that
1769120	1775280	this uncertainty is quite big and as I say this the idea behind the study was
1775280	1777960	not only looking at this to make the decision to withdraw the use of the
1777960	1781800	vaccine that's AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa because a part of the study
1781800	1786720	was also about neutralizing antibodies etc there's a whole other parts to that
1786720	1791520	but see how difficult it is or how difficult it can be if you've got
1791560	1796880	relatively small sample sizes and the risk is also small then you are going to
1796880	1803160	struggle to make a decision because your uncertainty in your efficacy is not
1803160	1807720	going to be very good there's going to be a wide confidence interval in the
1807720	1811680	efficacy so I hope this was interesting for you leave some comments down below
1811680	1819000	remember to like the video you can read this these notebooks here on our pubs
1819280	1824680	or follow the link down below to download the RMD files the our markdown files if
1824680	1828800	you've got our studio you can just import that and you can play around with
1828800	1835400	these values maybe simulate some more draw some pretty graphs etc and I hope
1835400	1839960	this really helped you to understand the idea a very relevant example of
1839960	1844600	understanding relative risk and efficacy
