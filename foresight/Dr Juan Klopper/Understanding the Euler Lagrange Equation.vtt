00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So what I'm going to do now is show you something beautiful, some beautiful mathematics.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
We can't do much in physics or we can't start this discussion properly

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
as far as the gradients and Hamiltonians are concerned

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
if we don't understand the concept of the minimum.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Something is at a minimum and that is how nature decides what to do.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Nature decides that the shortest distance between two points

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
in a clean space is going to be a straight line.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
How does it decide that?

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
There must be something underlying this decision in nature.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
It's the concept of the minimum and you've got to understand it

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
through the concept of the calculus of variations.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
So how do we do that?

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
There's going to be many boards and I'll have to wipe the board in between.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Let's just have a look at this.

00:57.000 --> 01:05.000
I have the XY plane and I have two points which is a starting point

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
and a final point and there's various paths I can take through this.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
So you could in space, there's my X and there's my Y.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm going to go from one point to the other point on some path.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
You can imagine I can go to Andromeda Galaxy and back

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
and there will still be one path if Andromeda is there

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
at least if I could just go in a two dimensional plane.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
There is many lines I can take between this

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
but I want the shortest possible distance between those two.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
The shortest possible distance.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
Now one way I can measure this, any of the paths

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
that I can possibly choose is just to divide it into tiny little segments

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
of say a specific length delta S.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
So let's blow that up a little bit.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.000
If I were to blow that up it's almost going to be a straight line.

02:08.000 --> 02:19.000
Most lecturers would skip this but then go straight to the integral

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
but this is good so this is going to be this arc length.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
It has a length but it will have from that point to that point

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
a delta Y and a delta X.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
So the length of delta S is very nearly going to be what?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Well the square root of that per se, this is Pythagorean theorem.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
So that will be delta X squared plus delta Y squared.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
Very beautiful and we know if I can let delta X approach

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
the limit take the limit as this approaches zero,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
this is going to become smaller, this line segment will become shorter

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
and right in the end I'm going to have this differential tiny little distance dS

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
which is going to be the square root of dx squared plus dy squared.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
We can all see that and I can rewrite this.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
Just want to show you how nice you can rewrite it of course.

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
You're going to say dS is going to equal the square root of,

03:27.000 --> 03:36.000
I can take a dx squared out which will leave me one plus dy squared over dx squared.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It's beautiful.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I've just taken this out as a common factor.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
If I were to multiply this back in there of course I'm going to line it back up there.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
In other words dS I can write as the square root of one plus,

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
let's just call it Y prime, Y with respect to x squared

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
and that's very ugly, I should do that.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
You can see as the whole it's dy squared and dx squared.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
So that and I'm just calling it Y prime dx.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
That's what I'm doing.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
So that will be the length of an infinitesimally small little line segment there.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
I've zoomed in so much that it actually is a straight line so I go from approximate to absolutely equal to

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
and that is in the limit as delta X goes to zero.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And what can I do?

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
How do we do integration if I have to just sum all of these together?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I take the integral of that.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
So if I were to take the integral of both sides, what am I left with?

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
S, the total distance of this arc, so this is just a line integral,

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
is going to be this definite integral and going from x1 to x1 to x2

04:49.000 --> 04:56.000
of the square root of 1 plus Y prime squared dx.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
So there's my line integral.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
And this is setting up distance, but this needn't be distance.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I can set up many things in physics.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I might want to know what the shortest time is.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
So there's going to be some path chosen that represents the shortest time.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I can have many things in here.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
I can have not just distance but shape what would be the minimum surface area of something.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
And I can do that by just setting up an equation for surface area.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
So what we do in calculation of various calculations of variations is

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
we're just going to call this I, that is this group for not only length

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
but surface area, time, anything.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
It's going to be something that I can now plot on a,

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
so there's needn't be distance and distance.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
We can have something else.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
But it's going to go from some initial point which I'll call x sub 1

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
and some final point which I'll call x sub 2.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
Just to refer to the fact that there's something on one of the axes

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
of some function and if I look at this function very carefully

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
it's actually a function of x, y and y prime with respect to that axis.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
So it's from one point to another point on that axis.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
So it's the f of x, y and y prime.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Now there's no x in there but that one might as well have been x to the power 0.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
So there is and there's no y, just a normal y in there

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
but that might also have been y to the power 0.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
In effect this is a distance one so there was no x and y in there

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
but there could be.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So there's a function of x, y and y prime.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
So at any time we can set this up.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
It's called a functional.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
This is called a functional that I'm going to do something

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
and it's going to give me some scale of value.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
And I'll clean the board and we're going to use this concept

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
to prove to you that in the Euclidean space,

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
and it's not some funny space, it's flat space,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
that the shortest distance between that point and that point

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
is going to be a straight line, we're going to develop this

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
to prove that that is indeed so and through doing that

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
hopefully I'll show you that that is what nature does

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
and that's what we can do.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We're going to use the calculus of variation

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
to show that there is something in here that is a minimum distance

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
or a minimum time or a minimum surface area

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
and that is what nature chooses.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I'm going to clean the board and we'll carry on.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
The board is clean, let's have a look.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So there we go.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Now imagine, I'm going to construct something.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
So imagine I knew the answer.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
The equation for that curve between the two points

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
which is the minimum.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
Imagine I knew that and that solution was the y of x,

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
small y of x.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Now let's construct another function,

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
we'll call it capital y of x,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
and that's going to include this small y of x

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
plus some constant multiple of a second function

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
called eta of x,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
as most textbooks will do it this way.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
And I'm going to pause the video here

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and just insert another video I made

08:24.000 --> 08:30.000
which is a screencast of how this is actually the absolute truth.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Before I do that I just want to make two things abundantly clear

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
and we're going to set this up.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
This is like a magician setting up something specifically

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
so that it works out for him or her.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And we're going to set this situation up

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
so that it does work for us.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
So this is my one point and my other point

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
and we all know intuitively this is going to end up being a straight line

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
but what if it isn't?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So I have this curve there

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
and right at this x sub 1

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
and right at this x sub 2

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I'm going to choose another curve

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and that's my curve,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
eta of x

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
such that at these points x1 and x2

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
it has a y value of 0

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
and I can choose many of these

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
just by changing this constant multiple eta.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
If eta is 1 this would be one curve

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
if eta is 1.5 it will be another curve

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
if eta is negative 3 this would be another curve

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
and this was my two answer which is a secret up till now

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
but imagine I knew what it was

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
and if I just add this at every point I just add these two

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
then I was going to have something like this

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
but you can imagine this capital Y of x

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
is just these two additives

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
but you imagine they are multiple

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
for every eta of x

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I can choose any constant

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
which will give me an infinite number of these little curves

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
which means added to the real answer

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I can get many others

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and remember single variable

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
just normal variable calculus

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
if I just had a curve

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
if I had a curve

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
and I wanted to know the minimum of the maximum

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
well all these extreme points

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
extreme would be at spots where the derivative

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
the first derivative was going to be 0

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
that is a minimum or maximum

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
and I knew it was a minimum

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
if I took the second derivative

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
and if that answer was at that point was larger than 0

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I knew that to be a minimum

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and that's the same thing we're going to do to this

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
we want a minimum

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
the derivative of this

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and set it equal to 0

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
remember this is how I set up my distance

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I had s equals

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
a different integral from x1 to x2

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
of the square root of 1 plus y prime squared dx

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
that was my distance

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
I want to take the derivative of that

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and I want to set it equal to 0

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
and if I do that

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm going to get to the minimum point

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
and that's what we want

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
something that this line falls exactly on top of that line

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
because if I do that

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
there will be some minimum

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
and that will be the two result that I get there

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm ahead of myself

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
so this is what we set up

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
I'm going to pause the video here

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
and insert that a little bit

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
just to show you that this is an actual fact

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
you can set this up

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
in many ways you can set this up

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
this is not some trickery here that is mathematically unsound

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
it's very sound

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
you can set this up and I'll show you in the video

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
so here we go

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
let me show you

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I want to construct this capital Y of x

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
in terms of small y of x

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
plus some other function eta of x

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
and at eta of x I want to be able to multiply by some constant

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
so I've set some things up here

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
let's have a look at them

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
let's just take some of these away

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
and let's just bring them back

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
one by one

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
just that this is my y of x

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I've made it a straight line

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
it needn't be a straight line

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and here's my eta of x

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
and I'm just drawing in these two straight lines

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
just to note that I've constructed eta x

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
in this instance it is something here

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
there we go

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
there's my epsilon

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
which I've called in here

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
and it's this

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
minus x minus 4 squared plus 1

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
I'll show you now why I put the n in there

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
so what I'm saying is

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
one thing

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I've got to construct this so that

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
at x1 and x2

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
which is this spot here

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
and that spot there

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I want that to correspond

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
here to the same values

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
that's why I've got the two straight lines

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
and the fact that

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
the y value for eta of x

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
down here has got to be 0

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
and 0 at both points

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
that's the way I want to set this up

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
so what I have now

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
is the capital Y of x

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
and the capital Y of x

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
between x1 and x2

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
has got to be the addition of these two

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and this is what we have right up here

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
this is this green

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
note though

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
that because eta of x is 0

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
at this point I'm not adding anything to

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
small y of x

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
and at that point I'm not adding anything to

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
small y of x

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
at these two curves

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
at every point on the x axis

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
between x1 and x2

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
if I added this value to that value

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
I was going to get that top value

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
that's what I'm saying

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
but look at this if I put eta in front of it

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
which here I've called n

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
it doesn't matter what size I make

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
eta

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
it's just some constant multiple

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
what epsilon I mean

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
my n here is epsilon

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
sorry for that

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
this value I make epsilon

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
it's a constant multiple

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
it is a constant multiple

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
of eta of x

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and these points still

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
correspond to

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
my little y of x

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
and my little y of x there

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
so it doesn't matter

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I now have this

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
almost well I can say

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
indefinite number of capital Y of x

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
every time that I change

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
epsilon

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I'm going to have a different capital Y of x

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
look at the green curve

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
there are so many of them

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
look how many of them

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
there are

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
that means to get from

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
1.1

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
to .2

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
there are many many

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
paths that I can take

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
and I've got to find the

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
shortest one basically

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
that's why I'm setting up this problem

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I want some minimum value

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and the problem I'm going to deal with

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
obviously minimum arc length

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
between these two points

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
but just to show you

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
that I can construct

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
this capital Y of x

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
in the manner that I've done on the board

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
and it makes absolute sense

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
and you can just see it

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
beautifully in this illustration

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
good I hope you enjoyed that

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
now this is beautiful mathematics

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
stay with me you'll see where this is going

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
so what we're suggesting

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
and remember that was

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
my equation and I'm going to take the derivative

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
of that and set it equal to 0

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
that will give me the minimum value

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
that's all we're going to do

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
but I don't have this anymore

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
I've changed it

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
that refers to what I had in me

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
the real answer was going to come from that

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
was going to come from that

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
the real distance was going to have

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
some equation to it

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
some value to it

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
that in the actual fact that now

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
is a new function

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
in x capital Y

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
in capital Y prime

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
that is what I have now

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
so by constructing this addition

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I've changed it from

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
x small y small y prime

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
to x large y y prime

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
so

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
some suggestion of this

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
will be remember that was

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
the square root of 1 plus y square

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
y prime squared

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
but if I do this to it

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I'm going to have

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
this as my f of x

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
I have this

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
and I'm going to just do

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
some preliminary work

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
and you'll see shortly why I'm doing this preliminary work

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
if I

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
if I had this

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
function

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
imagine let me just write it out

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
y of x

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
equals the y of x

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
plus

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
epsilon eta of x

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
what if I

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
were to take the derivative

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
of this with respect to this constant

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
can you take a derivative with respect

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
of constant of course you can because

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
what is 4

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
other than 4x to the power

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
0

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
if I were to take the derivative with respect

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
to x

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I can still take the derivative here

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
with respect to x

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
that's probably not the best way

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
to explain it

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
let me rather do this

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
can I say

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
d y

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
capital Y of x

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
d epsilon

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
can I say that

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
now I don't necessarily want to do that

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
it's going to be a bit difficult

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
let's do the partial derivative

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
partial derivative with respect

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
to that constant

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
appear there

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
so that's going to equal 0

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
and

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
as I said I could have written this

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
with an x to the power 0

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
and what you can see this as

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
basically I suppose

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
is just the product of two functions

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
so I can take the derivative of this

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
times that

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
and this times the derivative of that

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
so I can actually have the

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
d epsilon

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
d epsilon

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
eta x

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
plus eta times

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
d

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
del

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
whichever way you want to pronounce it

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
of

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
eta x

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
so what are we going to have here

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
we're going to have the fact that

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
that's 0

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
that is 1

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
so we will

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
definitely have that

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
so that will be the eta of x

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
and there's no eta in there

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
so the partial derivative

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
of that with respect to epsilon

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
sorry is 0 0

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
times epsilon is 0

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
so the derivative of capital Y of x

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
with respect to epsilon is just

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
eta of x

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
let's take y prime

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
of x

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
well it's just going to be that

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
prime

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and you can put the examples in here

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
and just show it to yourself

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
and what is going to happen here

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
well it's with respect to

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
x that I'm taking

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
that I'm taking this derivative

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
that is a function of x

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
so this is very easy this is going to be

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
epsilon eta prime

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
of x

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
in what way to happen if I took the

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
partial derivative of y prime

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
with respect to

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
epsilon

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
there's definitely a partial derivative

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
there's nothing in there that's going to be a 0

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
exactly the same thing has happened there

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
it's going to happen here

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
so we're just going to have eta prime of x

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
so that's all we're going to have

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
so these are the two equations

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
some preliminary work

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I probably shouldn't have bought it in here

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
because you wonder why is he doing this

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
why is he doing this

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
let's clean the board and we'll carry on

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
let's carry on

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
now remember this thing

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
back I had my equation

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
which was this 1 plus y prime

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
square root of that

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
what were to happen if I

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
took the derivative of this

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
of this function

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
well I would have had to use the chain rule

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
so when I had the f of

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
x, y and y prime

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
I was going to have to use the chain rule

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
nothing changes if I have

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
this

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
if I have that function I'm also going to

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
have the chain rule

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
but because I have changed this

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
into that

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I have a new

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
function i

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
which I now want to make a function

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
of epsilon

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
that is now going to be

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
x of 1 to x of 2

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
of the f of x

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
capital Y

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
capital Y prime dx

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
I have now changed

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
when I went from

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
my previous solution to this solution

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I have now made this

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
a function of

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
eta because I could get

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
many y of x's

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
by simply just

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
changing this constant

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
so this now becomes a constant

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
of this function

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and if I wanted to take the derivative

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
of this

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
if I wanted to take the derivative

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
of this with respect to

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
epsilon

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
why did I say eta all the time

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
you know what I mean when I write this

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
when I write this with respect to

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
with respect to epsilon

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
what is going to happen

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
now that is why I chose things

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
very carefully I also want to

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
do it at a point

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
where epsilon equals

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
0 and that's why I set things up

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
so remember when I showed you

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
on the screencast

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
that's why I chose things one of the reasons

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
and there's another reason there's sales

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I wanted to because of that equals

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
0 then

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
my large y of x

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
this one will be exactly equal

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
to this one they'll fall on top of each other

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
and I'll have my solution

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
and another thing is

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
remember when I took the derivative

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
when f hat is 0

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I have a minimum

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
so this is the secret

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
to this whole thing I'm going to take the derivative

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
so I've changed it to a function of eta

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
I'm going to take the derivative

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
with respect to eta exactly where eta

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
is 0

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
and if I set it equal to 0

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
that is the calculation

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
the calculus of variations

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
now just as we had

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
here I would have had to use the chain rule

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
let's use the chain rule

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
of this because if I

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
take the derivative of this

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
it's actually this

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
if I take the derivative of

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I with respect to eta

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
it's the same as doing my integral

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
and taking the derivative of this inside

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
remember your first year calculus

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
so what we're saying here

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
they're just going to equal

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
the different integral going from this to that

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
and I'll have to apply the chain rule

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
so I'm actually going to have

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
d i f

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
d i small

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
let's do that

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
d i f d i capital Y times

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
del Y

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
del

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
epsilon plus

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
we must not make a mistake here

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and I'm going to have f with respect to

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
y prime times

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
y prime

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
over epsilon

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
all of that

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
dx

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
so don't get confused here this is just the chain rule

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
of a function

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
of any function

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
remember if you were to take the chain rule

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
of something if you would take the first derivative

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
of something as simple as this

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
it would be very easy to do

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
this was going to be to the power half

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
you bring the half forward

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
and that becomes negative of half

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
the derivative of the inside function as well

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
which is going to be 2y prime

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
so it's easy to do

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
for any function f of x y

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
and y prime

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I was going to use the chain rule

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
so yeah I'm also going to use the chain rule

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
nothing different and that's exactly

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
what I have there

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
and remember just the board before

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
I did this

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
and I did this so I know

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
what this is this was

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
remember what this was

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
or that was this

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
eta of x

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
remember that

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
rewind and you'll see and what was this

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
it was

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
eta prime of x

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
okay

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
so that works for me

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
and this has got to equal 0

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
because if I set it equal to 0

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
then I have a minimum

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
okay we know where it was

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
it's going to be an extreme

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
but let's call it a minimum for now

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
because that is exactly what it is

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
okay so we are there

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
what I want you to realize is one thing

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I can do this

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
as integration by parts

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
remember the integration by parts

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I just have to decide which one is u

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
and which one is v prime

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
and that's very easy to do

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
let's choose my v prime

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
equal to this

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
eta prime of x

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
that makes my v equal

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
to the prime eta of x

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
and if this was that

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
then that must mean

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
this one is u

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
by if

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
by capital Y prime

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
and that makes my u prime the d dx

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
of

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
by if

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
by y prime

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
now I can just simply do

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
integration by parts

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
remember that would be this times that

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
minus

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
the integral

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
of this one times that one

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
remember integration by parts

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
but I want to show you something

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
very specific here as well

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
and that's why I set things up

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I was a magician and I set things up that they were

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
out specifically for me

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I said I want to do this

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
around a point where eta equals 0

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and what's going to happen

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
when eta equals 0

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
when eta equals 0

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
capital Y of x

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
and small y of x are going to be

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
exactly the same thing

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
they're going to be exactly the same thing

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
so what we're going to have

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
is the following so remember when I have

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
the integral

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
of the sum of two functions

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I can just do them separately

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
so here I'm going to have

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
x sub 1 to x sub 2

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
of del f

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
del y

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
I'm making it a small y now because I'm setting

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
things up way epsilon equals

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
0 so then I will have

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
capital and lowercase

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
y of x is being exactly

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
the same times the eta

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
of x

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
del x

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
now for this side

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
I'm going to do this integration by parts

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
so it's u times v so it's d

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
these two so it's del f

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
del y prime times

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
eta

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
of x

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
from x sub 1 to x sub 2

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
minus

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
the integral of

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
going from x sub 1 to x sub 2

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
of these two

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
so it's

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
d dx of

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
del f

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
del y prime

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
eta

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
what was that

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
eta of x

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
dx and that's going to equal 0

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
I hope you can still see that

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
now remember also when I did here

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I let these two

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
points be exactly the same

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
so if I were to plug

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
those into there

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
I was going to get 0

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
so this whole turn disappears

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
this whole turn disappears

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
and what am I left with

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
this integral

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
minus this integral

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
is going to equal 0 I can put them all together

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
in the same integral because this is

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
the difference between two functions

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
and I can take

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
these two out

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
is a common factor

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
and what am I going to be left with

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
going from x sub 1 to x sub 2

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
of what

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
well we're going to have

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
del f del y

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
minus

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
the dx of

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
del f

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
del y prime

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
all of that times

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
the eta of x

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
all of that dx is going to equal

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
0

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
and that low and behold

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
is the way we were trying to get this

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
is a thing of beauty

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
now I want to set this up

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
for any

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
eta of x

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
any eta of x

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
because for a different integral

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
to equal 0 that means this

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
inner part

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
this integrand has got to be 0

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
but I want it to be for any

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
function of 0 so

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
arbitrary function of eta

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
and so if that can't be 0

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
it's being multiplied by this

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
this has got to equal 0

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
and that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
is the Euler

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Lagrange function

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and it states the following

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
that del f

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
del y

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
minus

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
the dx

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
of del f

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
del y prime

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
equals 0

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
there we are

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
that is the thing of beauty

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
and remember when my f was this

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
this was my f of xy and y prime

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
if I were to take the derivative

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
of this with respect to y

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
and I took the derivative

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
of this with respect to y prime

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
and then the derivative

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
of that

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
equal to 0 I was going to get

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
the answer

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
for the shortest distance between those two points

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
but I generalised it as I

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
so it might be the shortest time

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
it might be the shortest surface area

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I can use the Euler Lagrange equation

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
to set up many physical

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
problems

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
if I can just through my physical problem

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
develop this

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
and we'll look at examples

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
in the next video I might just show you

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
how this distance between two points is a straight line

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
by solving

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
this Euler Lagrange

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
but this Euler Lagrange equation

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
right here is absolutely a

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
thing of beauty

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and we set it up right from here

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
right from the start

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
we use the simple fact that the first derivative

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
if you set it to 0 you are going to get an extreme point

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
and that extreme point

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
is going to be a minimum

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
value for you

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
it's going to work out in this instance to be a minimum

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
instead of an extreme point

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and you're going to land up

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
with this

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
this is a real

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
true a thing of mathematical

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
beauty

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
now

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
let me prove to you that the

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
shortest distance between two points on the Euclidean surface

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
is just a straight line

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
nature will always choose

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
a straight line

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
so you'll remember my equation for

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
using integration a line integral

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
for the length of

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
any arc

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
is that

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
this is my Euler Lagrange equation

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
so let's just do that

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
this is my F

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
this is my function F

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
function of x, y and y prime

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
let's get

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
iF times y

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
what is that going to equal

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
of this this bit well

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
there's no y in there so this is going to be 0

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
that was a simple one

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
y prime

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
well there's a y prime in there

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
so I better do this properly and I've got to do it

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
we said it before

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I've got to do it

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
by

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
the following method

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
so what is that going to be

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm going to bring the half forward so that was going to be a half

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
times

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
again we

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
we're still going to have this

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
squared to the power negative

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
for half and then I still have to multiply

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
by the inner

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
which is going to be 2 times y prime

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
that's really firstly a calculus

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
except that this is a partial derivative

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
but there is y prime in there

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
so these two are going to go

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
so what am I left with

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
I'm left with y prime over

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
the square root of 1 plus y prime

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
squared

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
that's what I'm left with

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
and so

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
they are left with 0 so I have

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
minus

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
dvx of

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
that which is now

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
just this

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
y prime over the

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
square root of 1 plus y prime

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
squared is going to equal

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
0

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
which I can multiply both sides

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
by negative 1 so this will disappear

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
simply

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
when is the derivative of

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
any function equal to 0

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
when that function is a constant

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
isn't it so all of this

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
is some constant

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
in other words

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
y prime equals

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
some constant times the square root of

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
1 plus y prime

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
squared

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
I can square both sides

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
if I square both sides

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I get rid of this

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
and I square my constant

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
which leaves me with another constant

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
I can multiply this constant in there

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
so I'm going to see

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
some constant plus some constant

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I can bring this over to one side

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
which means y prime

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I can get on its own

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
which is then going to leave me

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
with 1 minus this

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
squared

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
remember I squared this now

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
to get rid of that

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
and that is going to

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
still equal some constant

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm going to divide this into that side

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
which is giving me another constant

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
and in the end I'm going to

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
take the square root of that so y prime

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
is going to be some constant

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
just run through that

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I'll be fishing

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
but just do it for yourself

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
you'll notice very quickly

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
that y prime

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
is equal to some constant

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
when is the derivative, how can a function of x

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
y prime of x

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
how can that be a constant

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
well the only way that that can be

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
is if the y of x

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
equals ax

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
plus b

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
if you take the derivative of that

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
that would come forward

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
so that's just my constant a

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
there's no x in there so that falls away

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
and what is that in the equation of

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
a straight line

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
proof that the shortest distance

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
between any two points in euclidean

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
two dimensional euclidean plane

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
is a straight line

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
how did I solve that

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
I set up my

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
differential

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
here

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
which is my

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
differential there

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and I used the calculation of

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
the calculus of variations

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
to set up the Lagrange-Waley equation

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
I used the Lagrange-Waley equation

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
and I proved that the shortest distance is there

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
so if I set something else

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
of the any physical system

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I'll have to set up this function f

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
and if I can set that function

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
of f with its time

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
with its surface area

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I can use the Lagrange-Waley equation

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
to always give me the minimum

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
that is why I can set up a physical system

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
where I can look at time

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
what will be the shortest time

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I can set up the surface area

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and the most famous one of those

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
is if you have two rings

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
one smaller, one larger

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
and you put them in some of this

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
bubbly soapy water

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
and you bring them out and you'll separate them

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
and that will form a very specific

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
pattern between those two

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
soapy bubble circles

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
and there's a reason why you choose that

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
because that will give you the minimum surface area

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
that whole surface area

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
of the soapy fluid material

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
between these two

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
you've got to make that a minimum

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
and minimum and you can do it for volume as well

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
why is this one a volume

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
a sphere

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
in nature it does that because

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
it is a minimum

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
and some minimum is chosen

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and lastly from that

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
who will come in this fact

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
a plane

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
that has to roll down

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
what is going to be the shortest time

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
for the ball to roll down

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
is it going to be a path that goes straight down

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
or is it going to be one of these

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
one of these paths

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
that is called the brachistochrome

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
problem

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
brachy which means short chrome

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
referring to time, shortest time

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
there's a reason why this ball

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
will roll down

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
will get from there to there faster

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
on the ball rolling down that path

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
there's a reason for that because nature

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
can choose the minimum time

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that's what nature does, it wants to choose the minimum time

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
to get from there to there

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
and that is why it will choose a specific path

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
that will be the shortest path

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
to get down there

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
you just have to work out

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
an f of x

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
for this problem

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
you
