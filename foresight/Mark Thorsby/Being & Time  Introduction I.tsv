0	3600	Hi, this is Phenomenology, and I'm Mark Thorsby.
3600	4600	Welcome back.
4600	5600	I hope you're doing well.
5600	9640	In this video, we're going to be taking a look at the introduction to Martin Heidegger's
9640	15080	seminal text, Being in Time, or in the German Sein und Zeit.
15080	16080	So welcome back, everyone.
16080	18560	I hope you're doing well.
18560	24360	So what we're going to be taking a look at here is, so far in this course, we've looked
24360	34680	at Edmund Husserl's text, Ideas 1, or an analysis of what pure phenomenology looks like.
34680	35680	And we've chosen that.
35680	41280	We chose that text, or I chose that text, because I wanted you to get a nice and a solid
41280	49160	understanding of what phenomenology is in its most basic and originary conception.
49160	51640	We're going to see here that really starting with this video is we're going to be looking
51640	54120	at phenomenology after Husserl.
54880	59960	Now, there's a lot of phenomenologists who follow Husserl, but probably the most important
59960	65200	and certainly the most impactful of these philosophers was Martin Heidegger.
65200	73160	Martin Heidegger not only studied directly with Husserl, but he even, his magnum opus
73160	78560	text, which here is Being in Time, he actually dedicates to Edmund Husserl, but we're going
78600	87600	to see that Heidegger, I think, really goes beyond Husserl and succeeds his master, as
87600	88600	it were.
88600	94800	And we're going to see that whereas Husserl's attitude and his philosophy we looked at was
94800	101120	really about the articulation of phenomenology and laying bare the science of phenomenology
101120	106920	as he saw it, in terms of what phenomenology does, how it operates, etc., etc., and what's
107000	111800	up in the principal themes and discoveries that phenomenology can offer us.
111800	116240	We're going to see here that for Heidegger, who's a phenomenologist, phenomenology becomes
116240	123240	a method for addressing the most important question for him, or the most forgotten question,
123560	125760	which is the question of Being.
125760	130960	And so we're going to see that he really radicalizes phenomenology in a way that is so pivotal
131080	134160	and so that really impacts a philosophy.
134160	140240	In many ways, I think, one could argue, indeed, people have argued that Heidegger is really
140240	145680	one of the most important, if not the most important, philosopher of the 20th century.
145680	148600	I don't know about the most important, but certainly I think he's up there at the top
148600	150200	too, in my view.
150200	154880	Him and Wittgenstein, I think, are the most important philosophers of the 20th century.
154880	160120	And so I'm really, really looking forward to Heidegger, these series of lectures.
160120	165200	And I hope that you'll be reading along with us as we go through these.
165200	169480	Now, I'm going to be honest with you, as we're reading Being in time, you're going to find
169480	172960	that Heidegger's language is very difficult.
172960	175840	I think it's difficult in a different way than Husserl.
175840	181000	Husserl, I think, part of his difficulty, or at least the part of the difficulty I have
181000	186640	when I read Husserl, just simply consists in terms of his terminological distinctions
186640	190680	and the many, many interrogative statements he seems to put in there.
190680	193920	I think Heidegger is a much cleaner writer.
193920	194920	It's much more beautiful.
194920	200280	But we're going to find that the difficulty with Heidegger's text concerns the very concepts
200280	204480	he's trying to lay bare, because Heidegger, we'll see especially in the introduction
204480	213320	here, believes that our understanding of phenomenology and ultimately our philosophical understanding
213320	219920	of being is itself hampered by all of the philosophical vocabulary and all of the philosophical
219920	227680	language that we become accustomed to that is sort of sedimented and accumulated over
227680	232280	the last couple centuries and over really a couple millennia.
232280	236000	So Heidegger has a more radical task, I think.
236000	242120	But I think you're going to see is that in one sense, once you're able to understand
242120	247120	what Heidegger is doing and being in time, it opens up and it actually becomes very clear
247120	248480	and I think quite beautiful.
248480	251640	So there's something really, really powerful of this philosophy and I think you're going
251640	252640	to enjoy it.
252640	254320	But you're going to have to struggle through it.
254320	256160	I'm not going to lie to you there.
256160	261560	So let's start off with a sort of quick introduction to Martin Heidegger and in terms of his life,
261560	265560	you see I sort of have put together a sort of brief timeline of some of the elements
265560	268200	of Heidegger's life just to give you a sense of who he is.
268200	269200	He lived from 1889.
269200	271720	Well, let me show you a picture of him here.
271720	272720	Here he is.
272720	278320	It's not the best quality picture, or at least the highest quality, but here is Heidegger.
278320	284040	You can see he's maybe not the most beautiful man, as it were, but he certainly looks like
284040	286120	a serious thinker.
286120	290320	Now his life, he lived from 1889 to 1976.
290320	298280	So really he spans the 20th century, most of the 20th century, his life and he actually
298280	302120	lived, of course he never met, but he lives in the same time.
302120	304560	He's born at the same time in which Nietzsche is alive.
304560	308480	And we'll see that although later on in the course here when we talk about the history
308480	313800	of philosophy, we'll see that Heidegger is strongly influenced or at least he recognizes
313800	316680	the importance of Nietzsche's philosophy.
316680	319080	Nietzsche died in 1901.
319080	325840	Now in 1909, Heidegger received his bachelor's degree.
325840	332720	And initially Heidegger had prepared, he was Catholic, and he was preparing to enter the
332720	336680	priesthood and he attended theological seminary.
336680	343760	It wasn't long after he began attending that he really became convinced that he didn't
343760	348400	really want to do theology, he was really interested in doing philosophy rather.
348400	357680	And by 1913, he pursues a doctorate in philosophy and in 1913 his doctoral exam is completed.
357680	365040	His doctoral exam was on the doctrine of judgment and psychologism.
365040	370000	So it's pretty interesting because when we read Husserl, if you recall, Husserl made
370000	376320	a sound critique of psychologism and he really, Husserl wanted to demarcate phenomenology
376320	382480	from psychology and Husserl, of course, was attacked for creating a sort of psychologism,
382480	390720	especially regarding the publication of the latter volumes of the logical investigations.
390720	395800	And there's a debate here, especially you can think here of Frege's critique of Husserl
395800	399760	as really providing sort of psychologism with mathematics.
399760	405400	So it's interesting here because Heidegger is sort of primed and ready in this sort of
405400	411120	discussion by studying psychologism and thinking about what it means to make judgments.
411120	419360	In 1915, Husserl, Heidegger, rather, completes his doctoral dissertation on the doctrine
419360	423720	of categories and the signification in Dunskotis.
423720	429720	Now many of you may not be aware of who Dunskotis was, but Dunskotis was a medieval philosopher
430160	436640	who in many ways begins to articulate an early conception of intentionality and he starts
436640	442320	to lay bare some early conceptions that bear a strong resemblance to phenomenology.
442320	447720	So there's something very, very interesting there in Heidegger's dissertation, though
447720	452040	by no means can talk about it really in this course.
452040	458040	In 1916, Heidegger meets Husserl and eventually begins to study with him and under him and
458040	460760	eventually later you'll see he succeeds Husserl.
460760	467760	In 1918, Heidegger became a private in the military for a year and but by 1919, Heidegger
469120	473880	became an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg.
473880	480320	In 1920, he begins teaching courses on phenomenology in particular and we'll see that like many
480320	485720	of the Greek philosophy, many of the German philosophers from his time, Heidegger is heavily
485760	491480	influenced by a classical reading of Greek philosophy.
491480	496040	You're gonna see as you read being in time, the Heidegger is consistently referring back
496040	498480	to the Greek here.
498480	502120	This course is not in Greek philosophy, so we're not going to spend too much time on
502120	507240	that, but I do encourage you to brush up a little bit on ancient Greek philosophy.
507240	511600	Take a look at, for instance, some of the lectures and metaphysics that I've posted of Aristotle's
511600	514840	metaphysics on the YouTube channel.
514960	519960	In 1923, Heidegger moves to the University of Marburg where he accepted a position at
519960	524960	the University, which is where Husserl was located.
524960	531960	In 1926, so in those three years, Heidegger is teaching vigorously and Heidegger becomes
532160	535480	very, very popular professor.
535480	538920	One of the things that was required though and still is required, you probably heard
539000	544400	of publisher perish at the universities, is that Heidegger wasn't really publishing
544400	547480	lots of books despite his enormous popularity.
547480	553480	You'll see his, not only does he follow in the footsteps of Husserl as a phenomenologist,
553480	559480	but he really begins to radicalize some of the problems that phenomenology can address.
559480	565960	In fact, one of the important lecture courses he gave, and eventually he gets published
566000	570480	and you can read it, is called History of the Concept of Time, which really is, if you
570480	573680	will, sort of first draft of being in time.
573680	578920	But Heidegger was, in the meantime, Heidegger was working on a draft of his sort of major
578920	582880	work called Zein und Zeit, Being in Time.
582880	587640	He was forced eventually by the university to publish it ahead of time.
587640	593320	One of the things interesting is that being in time was actually never fully finished,
593320	595560	which raises some interesting questions for us.
595680	602680	In 1926, Husserl, Heidegger presents Being in Time to Husserl at his 67th birthday party.
603200	609320	And in fact, the book itself is dedicated to Edmund Husserl, so the two are very, very
609320	612320	close friends in 1926.
612320	620320	Now, over the, between 1926 and 1933, there's a lot of amazing work that Heidegger would
620320	621320	do.
621320	626080	He needed to do really, I think, amazing philosophical work throughout most of his life.
626080	630960	But in 1933, he was elected director at the University of Freiburg.
630960	635400	But in the same year, Heidegger joined the National Socialist Party in Germany.
635400	641160	That is, he became a Nazi, and he joined the Nazi party.
641160	647360	And what's more than that, Heidegger actually gave a series of speeches and a series of
647360	651200	talks arguing in favor of the Nazi party.
651200	659680	And especially regarding his, Heidegger especially denounces the Jewish conspiracy in Germany.
659680	665400	And he supported the new laws that the Germans had passed, that had passed under the Nazis,
665400	675800	that it dismissed intellectuals, Jewish intellectuals from serving within academia at the university.
675800	680200	And it's at this time that Husserl is forced to retire for racial reasons.
680200	684960	Husserl was actually a Protestant in terms of his religious affiliation.
684960	691920	But he was Jewish in terms of, he was Jewish, and so he was forced to retire, really quite
691920	692920	tragic.
692920	698560	And unfortunately, there's a sort of, there's a lot, there's a big question here about Heidegger's
698560	705440	relationship to Husserl in 1933, which you really see a sort of breakdown, unfortunately.
705440	710600	And of course, I mean, I'm not, this isn't a course on German history, and so I won't
710600	716560	go into all of what happens between 1933 and of course, 44.
716560	720800	But everything basically goes wrong in German culture.
720800	727040	One of the philosophers who actually studied under, and who's also a phenomenologist who
727040	729720	studied under Martin Heidegger is Hannah Arendt.
729720	735160	And Hannah Arendt actually was also Heidegger's lover too.
735160	742960	She was Jewish, and she was also forced to flee Germany despite being German herself.
742960	747520	But she writes a book that I encourage you to take a look at called The Origins of Totalitarianism,
747520	753120	which she looks at, she gives a phenomenological reading to a certain degree.
753120	758200	She has more other texts, which are more phenomenological in nature, but she looks at the question of
758200	767040	what it means for the Germans to have moved into this sort of racial programming, essentially.
767040	769520	So take a look at that text, it's quite interesting.
769520	775520	Now in 1934, though, Heidegger actually resigned his rectorship, and he actually stopped taking
775520	777320	part in the Nazi Party meeting.
777320	782880	So after 34, Heidegger is not, he doesn't, he's not official, he's still an official
782880	787040	Nazi member of the party, or official member of the Nazi Party.
787040	793880	But Heidegger, his role in terms of the Nazis really diminished, and of course, this is
793880	801680	many, many years before the genocide of the Jewish people, and the genocide of others.
801680	806640	So we can't, we're not gonna associate Heidegger, at least I don't associate Heidegger with
806640	811800	the genocide, though it raises important ethical questions regarding his affiliation,
811800	816720	especially because Heidegger refused to recant his Nazi involvement, in fact, his entire
816720	817720	life.
817720	824440	He never regretted being Nazi, and it's hard not to be critical of Heidegger, and I think
824440	827840	we really should be critical in this regard.
827840	834240	Now in 1938, in the midst of World War II, or the beginnings of World War II, Husserl
834240	835240	dies.
835240	840560	And it's really quite tragic because Husserl was prolific writer, a prolific and important
840560	845440	philosopher, and he really created a whole realm of philosophy at the center of which
845440	846440	is Heidegger.
846440	852560	But when Husserl dies, only two professors attend his funeral.
852560	859440	He was really shunned because of his Jewish heritage, which is evil, I think, and tragic.
859440	863440	In 1945, Heidegger survived the war.
863440	868200	People weren't sure if he had survived the war, but he did survive the war.
868200	876000	And a series of denazification hearings begin, in which the Nazi party is disbanded in Germany.
876000	882520	Karl Jaspers, who's an important phenomenologist actually, and a contemporary of Heidegger's.
882520	889480	At one point, Heidegger and Karl Jaspers had had a series of correspondences, but Heidegger
889480	890880	dropped them off.
890880	901680	Well, Jaspers writes a report on Heidegger's involvement, detailing, you might say, Heidegger's
901680	907960	his anti-Jewish work and the sort of the negative things that Heidegger had done.
907960	913720	The University of Freiburg faculty debate Heidegger's involvement in 1945, and by 1946, Heidegger
913720	919480	actually suffers a nervous breakdown that year, but the University of Freiburg faculty
919480	925000	of the University of Freiburg ultimately decided to grant Heidegger faculty emeritus
925000	931640	status, which means that he's still a member of the faculty, retired, as it were.
931640	936400	But he's barred from teaching, so he's banned from teaching any more lectures.
936400	939160	And really, it's because of his involvement in the Nazi party.
939160	944120	By 1951, the ban on teaching is lifted, and Heidegger then begins to give a series of
944120	948040	lectures throughout his career, and throughout the rest of his life, he continued to give
948040	951600	a number of really important lectures that are worth reading.
951600	956320	Tragically, as I mentioned before, Heidegger, at least on my view it's tragic, Heidegger
956320	959760	refuses to recant his Nazi involvement.
959760	967960	In 1976, Heidegger dies, and just a couple days after Heidegger dies, Der Spiegel, which
967960	973320	is a very important publication in Germany, publishes an interview that they conducted
973320	974320	with Heidegger.
974600	979200	And one of the things in that interview was they asked Heidegger point blank whether or
979200	987680	not he regretted his involvement as a Nazi with the Nazi National Socialists.
987680	992200	And Heidegger says no, and it's shocking.
992200	998840	The question for us is, how could a philosopher who really provides us fabulous insight philosophically
998840	1005160	into the question of being, and really pushes phenomenology into a whole new domain and
1005160	1011320	becomes really so critical to the rest of the 20th century and 21st century philosophy,
1011320	1018840	how could such a philosopher become so blind so as not to even regret his involvement with
1018840	1025760	really one of the darkest stains in human history, politically and especially within
1025760	1026760	German history.
1027080	1029640	So it's quite shocking there.
1029640	1033920	I do think, and I don't really want to spend a lot of time talking about Nazis or National
1033920	1039400	Socialists in this video, but it raises for us some fundamental questions regarding is
1039400	1044000	there a relationship between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazism.
1044000	1047960	Heidegger actually claimed that there was a certain relationship regarding his conception
1047960	1048960	of historicity.
1048960	1055800	We're not going to go into that right now, but on the other hand, or is his philosophy
1055840	1057400	really separate from this.
1057400	1062160	I think it's important to recognize that Heidegger is not giving us Nazi philosophy.
1062160	1067080	I think that is a misreading of Heidegger's work, but that does raise for us ethical
1067080	1068080	questions.
1068080	1073280	And in the early 80s, French phenomenologists raised this question explicitly regarding
1073280	1081720	whether or not Heidegger's involvement with the Nazis, and especially Heidegger's involvement
1081800	1087840	regarding who's forced retirement, whether or not that's something we can forgive and
1087840	1089280	how we should understand that.
1089280	1093960	So there's something we're talking about here, and maybe at some point in these series
1093960	1097360	videos we'll talk about it, but you're going to see really what I want to do in these video
1097360	1103760	lectures is really just take a look at Heidegger's understanding of phenomenology and in his
1103760	1105760	introduction to being in time.
1105760	1108400	So let's sort of take a look at that.
1108400	1112640	We're going to focus really quite heavily on just giving a really detailed reading in
1112640	1116040	this video of the introduction to being in time.
1116040	1121400	I imagine this video is going to run long, so feel free to pause the video, take a break
1121400	1122400	as you go through.
1122400	1126240	Let me take a drink off here.
1126240	1133400	Now being in time, the German, of course, is Sein und Zeit, was first published in 1927
1133400	1140560	in the Jahrbuch für Phänomenologie und Phänomenologist Foschum, which is a journal that was actually
1140560	1152040	edited by Edmund Husserl, so being in time here is first published by Husserl, actually,
1152040	1153040	if you will.
1153040	1158920	Of course, the book is dedicated to Husserl, and I mentioned this previously, a key preparatory
1158920	1159920	text.
1159920	1165120	There is no doubt that being in time is a difficult text to read.
1165120	1170400	If you would like, I encourage you to take a look at Heidegger's lecture, a history of
1170400	1175200	the concept of time, which is now published, which really is, if you will, sort of first
1175200	1179080	draft of being in time, because one of the things you're going to see in being in time
1179080	1184560	is that Heidegger jettisons our ordinary philosophical vocabulary, and really jettisons
1184560	1192160	the language that we saw Husserl using completely in order to articulate a new and a fresh,
1192160	1198080	and I think a more originary conception of Phänomenology and the question of being in
1198080	1199080	particular.
1199080	1204760	There's a lot of other great texts that can help you, great texts and commentaries that
1204760	1207840	can help you understand the history of the concept of time.
1207840	1216120	My own, there's a great philosopher, contemporary philosopher, Simon Critchley, he's actually
1216120	1225120	the editor of the New York Times philosophy blog, called The Philosopher's Stone, but
1225120	1231320	Simon Critchley has a great text on Husserl that was published just a couple years back
1231320	1236400	on being in time, which really lays out, I think, a really, really fantastic explanation
1236400	1243360	and commentary of Heidegger, and of course, I was previously, I'm friends with Simon,
1243360	1250160	with Professor Critchley, and that's my reading of Husserl is very much influenced by Professor
1250160	1251160	Critchley.
1251160	1253400	So take a look at that, there's some great stuff in there.
1253400	1256200	Now, what's the structure of being in time?
1256200	1259880	Well the basic structure is there's an introduction, that's what we're going to be looking at in
1259880	1261040	this text.
1261040	1266440	Part one is called the interpretation of docile in terms of temporality, and the explication
1266440	1269640	of time is the transcendental horizon for the question of being.
1269640	1273800	By the end of today's video, you'll have an understanding of what this is talking about,
1273800	1277440	if you've never read or read Heidegger before.
1277440	1282960	And then the being in time is actually structured into two different divisions, the preparatory
1282960	1288200	fundamental analysis of docile, I'm sorry, part one is divided into two divisions, the
1288200	1293620	preparatory fundamental analysis of docile, and then division two is about docile and
1293620	1295920	temporality in particular.
1295920	1301240	Part two of being in time was actually never completed, in fact, the majority of this book
1301240	1306720	was never completed, partially because Heidegger was forced to rush this into publication in
1306720	1309920	order for his career, publisher, parish.
1309920	1316160	You're going to see that Heidegger really structures being in time in a very similar
1316160	1321800	and definitely a very Germanic way, similar to Husserl who got a series of sections.
1321800	1326240	Heidegger organized the text as a series of paragraphs and then sections within those.
1326240	1329920	And this is how Zion Insights is organized.
1329920	1334000	So let's sort of jump in here and you'll see that before the book even starts, there's
1334000	1337120	a brief title page in which there's this quotation.
1337120	1342320	And we're going to see that, although this is a course in phenomenology, Heidegger is
1342320	1344880	not writing a book on phenomenology.
1344880	1350920	He is interested in the most important question for him, which is the question of being.
1350920	1355280	And of course, we know that the philosophy is concerned with lots of things, but at
1355280	1361680	the core, philosophy is concerned with what it means to exist and what it means for us
1361680	1364280	to understand things in existence.
1364280	1368560	All of this ruminates around this concept of being, and we're going to see that this
1368560	1372040	is the most important question for Heidegger.
1372040	1375600	So let me tell you, I want to read this passage from you just because this is directly from
1375600	1381160	the title page here, or right after the title page before he begins the introduction.
1381160	1383720	And it's quite beautiful, but it sort of gets to the heart at it.
1383720	1385560	And so let me read this to you.
1385560	1391080	Heidegger writes, For manifestly, you have been aware of what you mean when you use the
1391080	1393160	expression being.
1393160	1398160	We however, who used to think we understood it, have now become perplexed.
1398160	1403360	Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word being?
1403360	1404440	Not at all.
1404440	1408640	So is it fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of being?
1408640	1416560	But are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression being?
1416560	1417560	Not at all.
1417560	1421000	So you can see here, he says that on the one hand, we don't even understand the question
1421000	1425960	of being, what we mean by this term being, but on the other hand, we don't even care,
1425960	1426960	right?
1426960	1431840	Our aim in the following treatise in Zang Un Zaitz is to work out the question of the
1431840	1435720	meaning of being and to do so concretely.
1435720	1441600	Our provisional aim is the interpretation of time as the possible horizon for any understanding
1441600	1443680	whatsoever of being.
1443680	1448920	But the reasons for making this our aim, the investigations, which such a purpose requires
1448920	1453880	and the path to its achievement, call for some introductory remarks.
1454000	1457640	So you're going to see this is the beginning of the introduction and you're going to see
1457640	1463480	that really Heidegger is interested in the question of what being is and he doesn't even
1463480	1467680	think we even understand what being means or we even know how to ask the question of
1467680	1468680	being.
1468680	1473680	And so really being in time is less about being and it's about what it means to ask
1473680	1477440	the question of the meaning of being itself.
1477440	1480920	So you're going to see him articulate all of this in the introduction.
1481280	1486000	I'm going to follow the introduction as closely as I can section by section.
1486000	1490280	I should emphasize that there's a lot to the introduction and there's a lot of arguments
1490280	1495000	that Heidegger makes that I'm not going to be talking about simply because I will run
1495000	1496000	out of time.
1496000	1499840	We're already 24 minutes into the video and we're only now getting to part one.
1499840	1504840	So I'm not going to cover everything and so I encourage you to read this carefully and
1504840	1509240	probably to get a commentary text to help you along as well.
1509240	1515360	Now the introduction begins with paragraph one which is the necessity for explicitly
1515360	1518320	restating the question of being.
1518320	1524200	Now the question of being here in the German is called the Zeinsfrage and that just means
1524200	1529920	question of being, right, the being question and what he wants to say is number one is
1529920	1533720	that the question of being is a forgotten question.
1533720	1537240	It's not even something that philosophers are talking about.
1537240	1542120	Just particularly that Edmund Husserl never really talks about this.
1542120	1547320	Husserl talks about ontological structures and this sort of stuff and Husserl talks about
1547320	1550800	existence and he talks about actuality.
1550800	1555240	Consider for instance how Husserl in our previous lectures here, he talks about the
1555240	1558960	suspension of our general positing of actuality.
1558960	1562760	Well, what is actuality?
1562760	1567200	That's not a question that Husserl asks and he doesn't think that any of the philosophers
1567520	1569280	are asking this.
1569280	1571280	This is a forgotten question.
1571280	1574440	So what exactly is the Zeinsfrage?
1574440	1579880	What is the question of the meaning of being, all right?
1579880	1584840	And Husserl starts off, I'm sorry, Heidegger starts off by saying that the question of
1584840	1592240	being is what is stimulating this ancient Greek research of Plato and Aristotle.
1593240	1602040	Here, of course, in our introduction to philosophy video series, I give a very sort of cursory
1602040	1606520	analysis of Plato's theory of the forms and in my history of philosophy course, we talk
1606520	1610000	a little bit more about Aristotle's metaphysics in more detail.
1610000	1613840	But we're going to see here that at the core of both Plato and Aristotle's, the question
1613840	1619720	of what it means to be, what it means to be and Heidegger actually would go on to give
1619720	1624560	very specific concrete lectures about Plato and Aristotle with regards to the question
1624560	1626000	of the meaning of being.
1626000	1631120	We're not going to really review those, but if you do, you will find that Heidegger has
1631120	1636200	a very, I think, unique analysis of Plato in particular.
1636200	1638360	He doesn't think that we understand Plato correctly.
1638360	1640440	Anyway, I'm not going to go into that.
1640440	1649320	But the meaning of being, the question of what it means to be is at the core of ancient
1650320	1651320	Greek philosophy.
1651320	1655280	But things are even worse than we realize because the original contribution of Greek
1655280	1661960	philosophy, Heidegger argues, has actually sanctioned the neglect of the question of
1661960	1662960	being.
1662960	1668120	That is, the Greek philosophy is generated out of this question of what it means to be.
1668120	1672960	But because we have all of these contributions from these Greek philosophers all the way
1673040	1681040	from the originary priests of cracks like Parmenides all the way up through Hegel, what we see
1681040	1684200	is that we've neglected the question of being.
1684200	1690320	Now, being on the one hand has been said as the most universal concepts, and here I encourage
1690320	1697760	you to take a look at the work of Thomas Aquinas, who actually focuses quite heavily
1697760	1702520	on the question of being, and Thomas Aquinas argues this too, is that being is on the one
1702600	1709080	hand the most universal concept, but it's also the most empty concept, because on the
1709080	1716360	one hand, everything that we experience and everything we see is a form of being, which
1716360	1718800	means that everything has been.
1718800	1722640	But since everything has been, we don't really know what we're talking about.
1722640	1726520	It's the sort of old idea that if something is everything, then in a certain way it's
1726520	1727520	nothing.
1728280	1733600	And that's to say that existence clearly is something, it's so universal, but because
1733600	1736520	of its universality, it's an empty concept.
1736520	1743360	In fact, it looks like being just simply resists every attempt at definition.
1743360	1749680	But everyone seems to use this term, and they seem to understand what being means, or as
1749680	1752760	Heidegger would say, there's so it would seem.
1752800	1758320	We don't really know what we're talking about, though we have some sort of general intuition.
1758320	1764400	We have some sort of provisional, obscure, average understanding, but it's insufficient
1764400	1766600	philosophically.
1766600	1770960	In section two, and by the way, in all of the video here, whenever I have a pagination,
1770960	1778720	I'm using the original Heideggerian pagination, and so it's page two here, Heidegger says,
1778720	1784800	in this way, that which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as something
1784800	1790200	obscure and hidden, has taken on a sort of clarity and self-evidence, such that if anyone
1790200	1795000	continues to ask about it, he's charged with an error of method.
1795000	1800600	So we sort of think that we know we have a handle on what existence and being means,
1800600	1805640	to the point that, for instance, if you ask a philosopher, they can rattle off a series
1805640	1807720	of arguments.
1807720	1811720	For instance, though Heidegger doesn't mention this at all, think about the ontological argument
1811720	1817640	for God's existence, and think about the use of existence and the use of being in that
1817640	1823720	discussion, in which it's taken as self-evident what it means for things to exist.
1823720	1828000	So philosophers are not really thinking about this question, especially when Heidegger is
1828000	1829000	writing.
1829000	1834480	Now, of course, we're going to see that phenomenology, as prepared by Edmund Husserl, provides
1834480	1838080	us a way in which to begin to access this question.
1838080	1842560	But consider the fact that all of the philosophical work that's going on really around the world
1842560	1849400	at this time, no one is asking this question, not in the way that Heidegger will ask it.
1849400	1853960	And Heidegger's argument here is that there's so many philosophical prejudices that we have
1853960	1855400	that they're really too numerous.
1855400	1860640	There's too many of them that we can adequately deal with at the beginning of being in time.
1860640	1864720	So we can't really start off and really understand what the meaning of being is, or even what
1864720	1870640	the question, the Zeinsfraga of being is, the question of being, because we just have
1870640	1873200	so many philosophical prejudices.
1873200	1876600	Recall when we looked at Edmund Husserl's work, Husserl talked about the idea that we
1876600	1881920	had to bracket off all of these theoretical concepts we become accustomed to, and we're
1881920	1886000	going to see that Heidegger not only agrees with Husserl, but he doesn't think we go far
1886000	1890480	enough because we can't really uncouple ourselves from them.
1890480	1894480	So all we really have is a clue to the question of being.
1894480	1898720	Now in the introduction of being in time, Heidegger begins by sort of signifying, we
1898720	1903880	have this clue about what the question of being is, but let's lay out what our prejudices
1903880	1906160	regarding being are.
1906160	1910400	The first prejudice here is the universal nature of being.
1910400	1916200	And that's when we say that, when, for instance, Thomas Aquinas says that being is the most
1916200	1919600	universal concept, well, what kind of, what does that mean here?
1919600	1926520	And Heidegger sees this as a prejudice, which makes it difficult, or really rather impossible,
1926520	1930960	for us to begin to think about what we're even talking about.
1930960	1938360	The first thing here is that Heidegger emphasizes that being is not a universal genus.
1938360	1944400	You'll recall that when we laid out the distinction between genus and species, the genus is always
1944400	1951600	a higher category that subsumes particular individual categories.
1951600	1955520	But the idea here is that when we say that being is universal, we don't mean that being
1955520	1956880	is a universal genus.
1956880	1959920	We're not talking about a category at all.
1959920	1961960	And this is the difficulty here.
1961960	1966320	For instance, Heidegger mentions that the medieval's refer to being, and they use the
1966320	1971480	term transcendus, or at least in the Latin formulation, I'm not giving you the Latin
1971600	1974600	here, but it transcends.
1974600	1976640	And of course, to transcend is to go beyond.
1976640	1983600	And it's important here to recognize that the being goes beyond categorization itself.
1983600	1988800	So being is not a categorical intuition as such.
1988800	1994960	Now he also mentions that, for instance, Aristotle understood the universality of being really
1994960	1997120	as a form of analogy.
1997160	2004640	So when we say that being is universal, we're saying something analogically, because being
2004640	2012640	is here, and we have genus and species, and universality is a type of genetic category.
2012640	2017320	But the idea here is that, for at least from Aristotle's perspective, is that this is
2017320	2023280	not saying it's not a genus, this is an analogical relation here.
2023280	2029760	And then in this section, as Heidegger discusses the universal nature of being, he talks about
2029760	2033680	Plato and Aristotle, and he really goes all the way up through Hegel, and talks about
2033680	2041240	how in Hegel, being becomes an indeterminate, something that's indeterminate in an immediate
2041240	2042240	sense.
2042240	2046280	And of course, I'm not going to go through Hegel's logic here, which is actually quite
2046280	2047480	complex here.
2047480	2050960	And also remember that Hegel has a work in phenomenology too.
2050960	2055360	Not the phenomenology that Husserl describes, but the phenomenology of spirit.
2055360	2059920	And so being is an important category within the phenomenology of spirit, but here it's
2059920	2062080	indeterminate in the medium.
2062080	2064080	What exactly does that mean?
2064080	2071160	Basically, Heidegger's contention is that we don't know, because the history of philosophy
2071160	2076840	is actually resulted in making being the darkest of all the concepts.
2076840	2080040	It's not just one genetic category among others.
2080040	2084080	It's something completely other than that, but the history of philosophy is essentially
2084080	2090960	shrouded our conception of being by making it a sort of genetic universal category.
2090960	2097160	Section number two, the second major prejudice here that Heidegger identifies is the indefinability
2097160	2099560	of being.
2099560	2103240	Think here about what he just mentioned about Hegel.
2103240	2107680	Here it's important to recognize that being is not an entity.
2107680	2109320	And this will become an important thing for us.
2109320	2116760	When we talk about the existence of something, the being of something, being in and of itself
2116760	2123400	is not a something at all, because every something is a something only in virtue of its having
2123400	2130000	being or participating in being or in some way being infused as a being.
2130000	2132200	But being itself is not an entity.
2132200	2136320	So we're not talking about a thing at all.
2136320	2140120	Being is on the one hand, it's not derived from some higher concepts, because if you
2140120	2144400	will, it's the most universal, right, but analogically.
2144400	2149280	But then on the second way, being is not presented through these lower concepts either, which
2149280	2158240	means that we can't uncover our concept of being by looking at conceptual relations.
2158240	2165440	So a taxonomy of concepts, or for instance, a logical analysis of conceptual relations
2165440	2170920	in terms of, will never give us insight into this problem of being, right?
2170920	2174440	There is no definition of being in the ontical sense.
2174440	2175440	This is a mistake here.
2175440	2176440	I apologize.
2176440	2180480	Let's just say ontical, and we'll talk about what that means in a moment here.
2180480	2184000	Heidegger will actually lay out specific definitions for these things.
2184000	2190640	And the idea here is that when we talk about the indefinability of being, right, indefinability
2190640	2196400	demands actually a thorough examination of being, because what is a philosopher to do
2196400	2198840	when a philosopher doesn't understand something?
2198840	2202440	It means that they should examine it even closer, right?
2202440	2207400	And we'll see that this is going to be Heidegger's insistent approach, right?
2207400	2212920	The third prejudice that Heidegger lays out regarding our inability to think about being
2212920	2215560	regards the self-evident nature of being, right?
2215560	2220600	When we talk about, in our experience about things having actuality, well, it just seems
2220600	2223560	that it's self-evident, right?
2223560	2229320	And what's important here is that the way in which we comport ourselves to being, or
2229320	2235680	let's put it this way, self-evident, when I look at something and say, oh, it's just
2235680	2238320	it exists, it's self-evident, right?
2238320	2243960	This actually takes us back to a way in which I'm organizing and comporting myself in consciousness
2243960	2245960	towards being, right?
2245960	2251160	And of course, a component here, a way in which we can talk about this is think about language.
2251160	2256360	We're constantly in our language referring to being, and here think about the copula.
2256360	2261240	A copula is a logical category, which is the category for being, right?
2261240	2267360	So for the example, the sky is blue, is, is the copula, and what is the copula?
2267360	2270800	Well, the copula is a demarcation of being, right?
2270800	2277800	So when I say that I am holding a coffee cup, M refers to being, right?
2277800	2282640	I'm saying that there's, that I'm saying that the coffee cup has being in my hand.
2282640	2287240	Well, what does it mean to demarcate being exactly?
2287240	2290440	What exactly are we talking about, right?
2290440	2295520	Obviously, I'm talking about a comportment in consciousness, but we're going to see significantly
2295520	2299120	every comportment is itself a form of being, right?
2299120	2304320	So the comportment towards entities always uses the concept of being, and this presents
2304320	2312160	us with what Heidegger calls an a priori enigma, that is, enigma that comes before our experience
2312160	2313160	itself, right?
2313160	2316000	A mystery that needs to be addressed.
2316000	2318840	So self-evidence here is a dubious procedure.
2318840	2324840	To say that something self-evident is really a way at avoiding the question and the mystery
2324840	2330960	of the demarcation and the significance of being, and it's a way to dubiously ignore
2330960	2334560	this a priori enigma, right?
2334560	2338880	Not only is there no answer to the question of being here, Heidegger says, well, not that
2338880	2342840	there's not an answer, but not only do we not have an answer to the question of being,
2342840	2346200	we don't even know what the question is, right?
2346200	2350480	And so, for instance, is if as I'm talking through this video lecture, you're thinking,
2350480	2351480	what is he talking about?
2351520	2356000	What does it mean to ask the question of what existence of being means?
2356000	2361520	You don't know because we don't even have a grasp on the question of being here itself.
2361520	2366360	And you're going to see this is in the introduction of being time, because being in time is meant
2366360	2374400	to give us really a path towards eventually being able to just understand what the question
2374400	2378600	of being is, just to get us to the point where we can understand what the Zeinsfraga is all
2378600	2379600	about.
2379720	2386360	Now, paragraph two of the introduction concerns the formal structure of the question of being,
2386360	2387360	right?
2387360	2390520	So, on the one hand, we don't know the content of the question of being.
2390520	2396400	We don't really know what we're asking, but we can recognize that to ask a question, every
2396400	2398800	question has a structure, right?
2398800	2402720	Because every question is something that always asks for an answer, right?
2402720	2408640	So, what is the, can we formulate this question, and then we can ask what belongs to the form
2408680	2410160	of any question?
2410160	2415840	Well, Heidegger says, right, is that every inquiry, because a question is to inquire,
2415840	2416840	right?
2416840	2420160	Every inquiry is a seeking, a sukin, right?
2420160	2425720	Every inquiry is a seeking, and every seeking is always guided by what is sought, right?
2425720	2428680	So imagine if I'm looking for my keys, right?
2428680	2434680	I'm seeking my keys throughout the room, looking, and what is guiding my seeking is what I'm
2434680	2436120	looking for, right?
2436120	2441560	So that means that the question of being, whatever it is, right, it's a seeking after
2441560	2445880	being, and it has to be guided by being itself, right?
2445880	2450880	So seeking for what being is, and that means we have to seek in regard to the manner of
2450880	2451880	being.
2451880	2456840	So, we can start to, as it were, so Heidegger's argument here isn't that the Zionsfrog is
2456840	2458520	an impossible question.
2458520	2463680	It's rather that we have to work our way out of our categories, and we can start by formally
2463680	2469160	understanding that the answer and the question of being itself ultimately has to be guided
2469160	2471600	by being, right?
2471600	2478360	So the form of a question always includes A, that which is interrogated.
2478360	2482120	This is what Heidegger does not use this term, and I think he would object to my using this
2482120	2483120	term.
2483120	2490000	What you might say is that the question always, right, moves towards, is looking for a specific
2490000	2491200	object, right?
2491200	2494840	It's guided, and it includes that which is interrogated, but it also includes that which
2494840	2497760	is found out, and here I want to talk about the essence here.
2497760	2502080	The reason I've included the object and essence here is because I want you to see that there
2502080	2509040	is a linkage between the Husserlian categories of phenomenology and ideas one in what Husserl
2509040	2510760	Heidegger is doing here.
2510760	2515880	Heidegger, for reasons we'll get to in a moment, specifically does not want to use this sort
2515880	2521160	of language, but it is, I think, helpful for us to, and for at least in this course, I
2521160	2527320	want you to see the lineage of what Heidegger is doing traces back to Husserl, right?
2527320	2533040	Now, inquiry to inquire itself is a particular manner of being for a being that inquires,
2533040	2534040	right?
2534040	2540360	So remember here is that since, so to just ask any question to inquire itself, only
2540360	2547240	beings which can inquire can ask questions, right?
2547240	2554200	And that means that as a being that can inquire, when I make an inquiry, I'm actually taking
2554200	2557160	on a particular manner of being, right?
2557160	2560240	I'm existing in a certain sort of way, right?
2560240	2564560	Here you can think about maybe Husserl's categories of noesis, it's a type of noema,
2564560	2566880	for instance, inquiry, right?
2566880	2573360	Now, Husserl is not, Heidegger is not going to follow Husserl along those lines, right?
2573360	2580360	And in a certain way, you can see here, there's a sort of tragedy regarding Husserl's view
2580360	2585160	of what phenology was to become, because in a certain way, it gets dismantled to some
2585160	2586520	degree by Heidegger, right?
2586520	2591760	But back to the point, inquiry itself is a particular manner of being for a being that
2591760	2592760	inquires.
2592760	2595200	Oops, let's go back there, right?
2595200	2600440	Now since we have some access to the concept of being, because we do have the copula, we
2600440	2605800	do use these concepts, that means that there must be a way to inquire about it.
2605800	2609400	You can see this is what Heidegger would call our average every day, of vague, I don't know
2609400	2610400	what it's right here.
2610400	2616840	This is what we call a vague average understanding, or an average every day understanding of being.
2616840	2618000	So what is being?
2618000	2623040	Well, Heidegger says, what we need to do is we need to know what the horizon for that
2623040	2625360	very question is, right?
2625360	2630400	And by horizon here, think about the language that Husserl used here to talk about, you
2630400	2634600	know, the conditions for the possibility of the question, right?
2634600	2640360	What we do know, for instance, about being is that being determines the entities as entities.
2640360	2645520	So anything can be an entity, everything from the coffee shop to the mirror behind me, to
2645520	2646680	me, right?
2646680	2653440	All of this is being, and we know that being is what determines an entity as an entity.
2653440	2657400	So you can't be an entity if you don't have being, right?
2657400	2661080	But being, like we said earlier, is not an entity in itself, right?
2661080	2662080	So what does this mean?
2662080	2669200	Well, it means that the Zeinsfraga is not a question, to address the Zeinsfraga, it's
2669200	2673160	not a question of trying to tell a story or trace an origin.
2673160	2674160	Why?
2674160	2677680	Because only entities have origins, right?
2677680	2684520	So we're not going to be trying to link it back to some sort of start with an entity
2684520	2687800	and work our way backwards to the question of being.
2687800	2693640	In a certain way, this is a way in which you might, for instance, understand the defunct
2693640	2700280	nature of the problems regarding first movers and all of this sort of stuff that you may
2700280	2706560	have heard of, or you can take a look at regarding, for instance, Thomas Aquinas' or Aristotle
2706560	2707560	here, right?
2707560	2710480	In which there's a sort of tracing towards origin.
2710480	2714640	Heinegger as explicit as we can't do that here, right?
2714640	2721240	On six, he says, hence being, as that which is asked about, must be exhibited in a way
2721240	2726840	of its own, and this is essentially different from the way in which entities themselves
2726840	2728280	are discovered, right?
2728280	2735560	So that means we need to find a way to understand being that is, that remains faithful or has
2735560	2738920	a fidelity towards being itself, right?
2738920	2742680	So that's why we can't tell a story because you can only tell stories of entities and
2742680	2745080	we have to be faithful to being as itself.
2745080	2748080	Now what are the different ways in which we recognize being?
2748080	2750920	Well, everything we talk about, right?
2750920	2755800	Everything we have in view, all of the things we comport ourselves towards, right?
2755800	2759840	We're being, how we are is being, right?
2759840	2763120	The inquiry itself is a manner of being.
2763120	2766920	When we talk about something having reality, we're talking about being, right?
2766920	2771360	And think here about, I can talk about the reality of that which is outside of me, but
2771360	2776440	I can also talk about the reality of the presentations I have in consciousness, for instance.
2776440	2780200	All of those are real, all of those have being, right?
2780200	2785040	That something is, and we're talking about reality, what is present hand, right, before
2785040	2786040	me?
2786040	2788240	What subsistence means?
2788240	2791880	Even validity is a way in which we recognize being.
2791880	2796520	And think here, if you want, take a look at my series on Introduction to Formal Logic,
2796880	2801000	and we talk about the validity of argumentative propositions, right?
2801000	2804320	Or for instance, quantificational validity.
2804320	2809240	To say that something is valid is to demarcate a form of being, right?
2809240	2812000	It's to say that something is, right?
2812000	2816400	So when we talk about there being something is, or we're talking about something given,
2816400	2818520	we're always recognizing being.
2818520	2824800	So whatever point of departure we're going to make towards being, we have to recognize
2824800	2827360	that these different manners, right?
2827360	2831880	So from which of the entities is the disclosure of being taken?
2831880	2832880	What has the priority?
2832880	2838600	Well, Heidegger says to understand being, we have to understand how we look at being.
2838600	2845840	In other words, we need to uncover the nature of the being that we ourselves are, right?
2845840	2852600	Because since being is something that's recognized by us, and that recognition is a form of being,
2852600	2859040	we can't understand what being is in itself, we have to first begin and uncover what being
2859040	2863720	means for the being, for whom being is a question, right?
2863720	2869560	We're going to see this as an explicit reference to an important concept of Heidegger's, okay?
2869560	2874960	Now this, and this is the concept, Dasein, right?
2874960	2879960	Heidegger writes on seven, this entity, which each of us is, is himself, and which includes
2879960	2885280	inquiring as one of the possibilities being, we're going to denote by the term Dasein.
2885280	2891040	Now in German, Dasein, you can see here, Zein is the term for being, and Da means to point,
2891040	2892040	right?
2892040	2895120	So here it means something like to point to being, and what he means to say is that we're
2895120	2897360	going to call ourselves Dasein.
2897360	2902280	Now later on, in just a minute, Heidegger's going to really say, and this is what I want
2902280	2907360	you to memorize here, is that whenever you say what is being, what is Dasein, Dasein
2907360	2911440	is the being, for whom being is an issue.
2911440	2916360	Now that means that all human beings who can ask the question of being, and who can recognize
2916360	2917440	being are Dasein.
2917440	2920920	So he's talking about us, Dasein is his term for the human.
2920920	2927240	Now he doesn't use the term human here, because by using the term Dasein, he's signifying
2927240	2932800	the, the being of the person who inquires after being, right?
2932800	2937200	So he's giving this new term, this new language.
2937200	2942920	In many ways, you're going to see that being in time operates almost lexinographically,
2942920	2948880	and it operates as a lexicon of concepts for thinking about how, what being is, and what
2948880	2949880	it means for us.
2949880	2954360	Now, Heidegger recognizes there might be a problem here, that is, is there a circularity?
2954360	2958040	Because are we really just saying we're going to understand being by understanding being,
2958040	2959040	right?
2959040	2965280	And, and Heidegger's response here is, well, that factically, there is no circle at all,
2965280	2966280	right?
2966360	2971040	Because when we look at the actuality of ourselves, the facticity of ourselves, and we'll see
2971040	2976720	later in the book, Heidegger will explicitly define facticity, though I'm not going to
2976720	2981760	do it now, is when we look to how we actually exist, we recognize that we can determine
2981760	2987200	the nature of an entity's being without first formulating the meaning of being itself, right?
2987200	2991640	That is, it's not circularity, but it's a relatedness between the backwards and the
2991640	2998240	forwardness of our inquiring nature of being as beings.
2998240	3000040	This stuff is difficult, I know.
3000040	3004680	So I hope this is helping, and I hope this, this is at least laying clear some of these
3004680	3005680	concepts.
3005680	3011760	Now, paragraph three is known as the ontological priority of the question of being.
3011760	3015440	Now, what he's going to argue here, and you'll see the ontology is going to play an important
3015440	3017480	role here, and we'll get to this in a minute.
3017480	3022600	Now, when we talk about this question of being, we can ask, is the Zeinsfrager the question
3022600	3027440	of being a matter of speculation, or is it a matter of the most basic and concrete of
3027440	3029320	all possible questions?
3029320	3034720	Of course, he doesn't think it's just speculation, he actually thinks it is a concrete question.
3034720	3041480	The problem is, it's a concrete question, but it's so concrete and so basic, and then
3041480	3046480	coupled on top of it with the history of our theoretical concepts and philosophy, we just
3046480	3051680	don't know what that concretizing thing is, right?
3051680	3057720	So the task here is to understand the constitution of entities, because every entity has being,
3057720	3065240	so the constitution of any entity ultimately must trace back to being, or as it were, right?
3065240	3069000	So the task is to understand the constitution of entities in their most basic sense, and
3069000	3072680	this is what a science is doing ultimately, right?
3072680	3075560	And Heidegger here actually discusses the role of the sciences.
3075560	3080720	He talks about the crisis of science in his day, or in I think would still be today, and
3080720	3085080	he mentions, for instance, the crisis in mathematics, we can talk about formalism and intuitionism,
3085080	3090120	but he goes on to talk about mathematics, physics, biology, the historical human sciences,
3090120	3093800	theology, and so forth.
3093800	3096120	All of these have a crisis, and what's the crisis?
3096120	3102760	The crisis refers to the idea that none of these sciences are able to articulate what
3102760	3107080	it means to evaluate the things themselves, right?
3107080	3111280	So for instance, mathematics is looking at mathematical concepts that have validity,
3111280	3112280	right?
3112280	3116280	That's a type of being, but what exactly is that mathematics can't tell us?
3116280	3119120	The same things with physics and center, right?
3119120	3124760	He has a quotation here on 10, quote, basic concepts determine the way in which we get
3124760	3129840	an understanding beforehand of the area of subject matter, underline all the objects
3129840	3135480	the science takes as its themes, and all the positive investigation is guided by this
3135480	3136480	understanding.
3136480	3141760	Only after this area itself has been explored beforehand in a corresponding manner do these
3141760	3145840	concepts become genuinely demonstrated as grounded.
3145840	3150160	So you can see here is that what he's going to say is that the sciences today are in crisis
3150160	3156960	because they have no grounding in their understanding of the copula, right, of being, of continuing
3156960	3157960	on.
3157960	3163720	And in every such area, every science is itself obtained from the domain of entities themselves.
3163720	3169400	This preliminary research from which the basic concepts are drawn signifies nothing else
3169400	3174960	than an interpretation of those entities with regard to their basic state of being.
3174960	3180440	Such research must run ahead of the positive sciences as Andy can.
3180440	3183520	Here the work of Plato and Aristotle's evidence enough, right?
3183520	3187520	You can see that Plato and Aristotle without any science, any conception of modern science
3187520	3193640	or any of the work that was laid out by the later scientists, right, they're able to begin
3193640	3194640	to address this.
3194640	3199760	So we can, in fact, begin to try to understand the grounding of the sciences by looking at
3199760	3204320	being other philosophers have done so, and we too can do it, right?
3204320	3207200	And this would hold for theology as well.
3207200	3213120	Now the crisis of the sciences require an examination of what it means for something
3213120	3215400	to be as they're given.
3215400	3219200	Now this is the discussion of ontology, right?
3219200	3224960	And in a really general sense, what you can say is that ontology is the, is, refers to
3224960	3229960	the logic of being, right, ontos being in Greek there, right?
3229960	3235440	And so what you might say is that ontology refers to the relations that beings have with
3235440	3236880	each other and with themselves.
3236880	3241600	Now Heidegger is doing a fundamental ontology at the, or he wants to get to a fundamental
3241600	3244120	ontology with designs froga.
3244120	3248960	Now Heidegger makes a distinction here between ontology versus what he calls the ontical,
3248960	3251480	or the ontic, right?
3251480	3255520	And this is sometimes referred to as the ontological distinction, right?
3255520	3262280	The ontology refers concerns being itself, whereas the ontical concerns entity, the being
3262280	3264520	of entities themselves, right?
3264520	3269760	So if we're talking about ontology in its most radical sense, we're talking about being
3269760	3270760	in and of itself.
3270880	3276960	If we're talking about ontics, we're talking about the being of specific sorts of entities.
3276960	3282320	So for instance, you can say that if we go back to Edmund Hustrel's discussion of consciousness,
3282320	3284040	all of that was ontical.
3284040	3288480	It wasn't ontology proper, right?
3288480	3297400	And the same thing would go for any number of philosophers we could name, right?
3297720	3303800	All ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at
3303800	3310000	its disposal, remains blind and is perverted from its own most aim.
3310000	3316840	If it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of being and conceived this clarification
3316840	3319040	as its fundamental task, right?
3319040	3324920	So all of the things that the ontologies we've seen previously were actually ontical because
3325320	3330440	the ontology itself, being itself, the meaning of being, is never answered or clarified.
3332200	3338440	OK, so now we're going to move to the paragraph four, where Heidegger discusses the
3338440	3342440	ontical priority of the question of being, right?
3343520	3350120	Now, science in general refers to the totality of established interconnections of true
3350120	3353160	propositions within a specific domain, right?
3353400	3354400	So that's what science is.
3354400	3359240	And you're going to see that the Heidegger is giving a science here, but he's giving
3359240	3362280	an originary conception of what a science means.
3362280	3367640	A science in general is this totality of established interconnections of true propositions.
3367640	3372640	The question of establishment here ultimately goes back to the type of science we're looking at,
3372640	3373160	right?
3373160	3378520	So how a chemist establishes true propositions in their interconnections differs from how
3378520	3380120	a mathematician does, right?
3380120	3384280	But they're both doing the same thing in a general level, as it were, right?
3384440	3388600	But the science of beings, but what about the science?
3388600	3396280	But science has the has the being of its entities, and that is every science ultimately also
3396280	3406440	includes the manner of being of which is the of which is the occurrence of the
3406440	3408280	inquire or the sciences themselves.
3408400	3417200	In other words, that the science has an ontical theme, which is determined by the
3417200	3421040	scientist, because the scientist is the person who's doing the inquiring.
3421040	3423760	So remember, we talked about inquiring as a manner of being.
3424000	3428960	Well, that filters into science, which means that the science has the being of its
3428960	3431720	entities that has its being of us or Dawson.
3432040	3439120	So what distinguishes Dawson ontically is that that is that being is an issue for it, right?
3439280	3442880	Or being in such a way that one has an understanding of being, right?
3443960	3448840	Now, the kind of being that Dawson can comport itself towards is designated by the term
3448840	3449440	existence.
3449440	3457840	So when I comport myself towards the coffee cup here, right, that comportment is designated
3457840	3459240	by existence, right?
3459240	3461520	That's what I mean by existence, right?
3461520	3466080	And think here about when if I don't know something exists, I don't know it exists
3466080	3471280	because I can't comport myself towards it, at least in a sort of kind of concrete
3471280	3471840	fashion.
3473480	3479600	Heidegger writes Dawson always understands itself in terms of its existence, in terms
3479600	3483040	of a possibility of itself to be itself or not itself.
3483240	3488040	Here, of course, I think of Shakespeare to be or not to be Dawson has either chosen
3488040	3494800	these possibilities itself or got itself into them or grown up in them already, right?
3494800	3499600	So, so how exactly Dawson gets in this, we're not sure, but there's these different ways.
3500160	3505080	Only the particular Dawson decides its existence, whether it does so by taking
3505080	3510520	hold or by neglecting the question of existence never gets straightened out, except
3510520	3512600	through existing itself.
3512960	3514520	And here's quite fascinating, right?
3514840	3522240	This is the idea here is that one cannot recognize existence, except through a manner
3522240	3524200	of existing, right?
3524680	3528360	You can see here, it's a similar sort of question to this problem of being.
3529120	3533960	Now, Heidegger is now going to start to give us a range of categories and lay out what
3533960	3534920	these categories are.
3535720	3540920	The understanding of oneself by existence is called what he calls the existential,
3541360	3542760	existential, right?
3543480	3544480	Let's see, let's move here.
3544760	3546440	And here's a list of categories, right?
3546680	3552120	So existence here refers to that which Dawson comports itself towards, right?
3552520	3556760	The existential is the understanding of itself by Dawson.
3557480	3564280	Existentiality refers to the structures of existence and existential refers to the
3564280	3567040	analytic of existentiality, right?
3567040	3571680	That refers to the analytic of the structures of existence and the understanding
3571720	3575800	of itself by Dawson is existential, right?
3576240	3581120	So he's sort of laying out these terms, which can be confusing, but I hope you'll see
3581120	3583880	there's a rigorous formulation to what he's doing here.
3584680	3589240	At the end of the day, what we can say is that being in the world is something that
3589240	3592760	belongs to Dawson existentially, right?
3592800	3600360	That is the analytic of the structure of existence for Dawson is that Dawson is a
3600360	3601960	being in the world.
3602400	3608080	All of us are always already thrown into the world as it were, right?
3608880	3612080	We're living in a world and we can't separate ourselves from that.
3612440	3618160	And so if we want to understand Dawson's existential, right?
3618440	3621920	Then we have to recognize that Dawson is a being in the world.
3622120	3626440	And we're going to see later on in subsequent videos that this will this this
3626520	3631400	insight of our being in the world as a preliminary structural category for
3631400	3638960	Dawson is going to allow Heidegger to lay out structurally his formal analysis of
3638960	3640640	Dawson, okay?
3641480	3645440	So on 13 he says, therefore fundamental ontology, right?
3646160	3650080	Remember the ontological distinction from which alone all other ontologies can take
3650080	3655080	their rise must be sought in the existential analytic of Dawson, right?
3655120	3661320	That has to be sought out in the way in which we are beings in the world.
3661320	3665320	The way in which we have, we're a manner of being towards things that exist, right?
3665600	3670840	Now that means that Dawson takes priority here in terms of articulating the meaning
3670840	3673080	of the question of being, right?
3673320	3676720	And so Heidegger lays out, he says, really when we talk about this priority,
3676720	3678600	there's three things that go along.
3679000	3683600	On the one hand, there's the ontical priority where Dawson is an entity whose
3683600	3687520	being has the determinant character of existence, right?
3687520	3692240	So Dawson is something that existing, but there's the ontological priority in
3692240	3696440	which Dawson is in itself ontological because existence is that's
3696440	3697840	determinative for it.
3698160	3701200	Remember Dawson is the being for whom being is an issue.
3701840	3707920	And then there's the ontico ontological priority in which Dawson also possesses as
3707920	3712240	constitutive for its understanding of existence, an understanding of the being
3712320	3717080	of all entities of a character other than its own, right?
3717200	3723480	So there's these sorts of three categories that Heidegger is going to use within the text.
3723760	3726840	Now, let me give you here this great quote from Heidegger here, which is quote,
3727320	3732720	if to interpret the meaning of being becomes our task, Dawson is not only the
3732720	3737760	primary entity to be interrogated, it is also the entity which already comports
3737760	3742680	itself and it's being towards what we're asking about when we ask this question.
3744760	3745840	So let's get moving here.
3746640	3747280	Okay.
3747800	3753280	Now, now this is section two of the introduction and I've already gone an hour.
3753280	3755680	So here's what I'm going to do as I'm going to stop right now.
3755960	3762320	And in the next video, I will complete our understanding are, I will complete the
3762320	3765480	video on the second part of the introduction of being in time.
3765720	3766720	Thanks again for watching.
3766720	3768080	I look forward to seeing you guys online.
