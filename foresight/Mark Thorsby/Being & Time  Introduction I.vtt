00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Hi, this is Phenomenology, and I'm Mark Thorsby.

00:03.600 --> 00:04.600
Welcome back.

00:04.600 --> 00:05.600
I hope you're doing well.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.640
In this video, we're going to be taking a look at the introduction to Martin Heidegger's

00:09.640 --> 00:15.080
seminal text, Being in Time, or in the German Sein und Zeit.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.080
So welcome back, everyone.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.560
I hope you're doing well.

00:18.560 --> 00:24.360
So what we're going to be taking a look at here is, so far in this course, we've looked

00:24.360 --> 00:34.680
at Edmund Husserl's text, Ideas 1, or an analysis of what pure phenomenology looks like.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
And we've chosen that.

00:35.680 --> 00:41.280
We chose that text, or I chose that text, because I wanted you to get a nice and a solid

00:41.280 --> 00:49.160
understanding of what phenomenology is in its most basic and originary conception.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.640
We're going to see here that really starting with this video is we're going to be looking

00:51.640 --> 00:54.120
at phenomenology after Husserl.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.960
Now, there's a lot of phenomenologists who follow Husserl, but probably the most important

00:59.960 --> 01:05.200
and certainly the most impactful of these philosophers was Martin Heidegger.

01:05.200 --> 01:13.160
Martin Heidegger not only studied directly with Husserl, but he even, his magnum opus

01:13.160 --> 01:18.560
text, which here is Being in Time, he actually dedicates to Edmund Husserl, but we're going

01:18.600 --> 01:27.600
to see that Heidegger, I think, really goes beyond Husserl and succeeds his master, as

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
it were.

01:28.600 --> 01:34.800
And we're going to see that whereas Husserl's attitude and his philosophy we looked at was

01:34.800 --> 01:41.120
really about the articulation of phenomenology and laying bare the science of phenomenology

01:41.120 --> 01:46.920
as he saw it, in terms of what phenomenology does, how it operates, etc., etc., and what's

01:47.000 --> 01:51.800
up in the principal themes and discoveries that phenomenology can offer us.

01:51.800 --> 01:56.240
We're going to see here that for Heidegger, who's a phenomenologist, phenomenology becomes

01:56.240 --> 02:03.240
a method for addressing the most important question for him, or the most forgotten question,

02:03.560 --> 02:05.760
which is the question of Being.

02:05.760 --> 02:10.960
And so we're going to see that he really radicalizes phenomenology in a way that is so pivotal

02:11.080 --> 02:14.160
and so that really impacts a philosophy.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.240
In many ways, I think, one could argue, indeed, people have argued that Heidegger is really

02:20.240 --> 02:25.680
one of the most important, if not the most important, philosopher of the 20th century.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.600
I don't know about the most important, but certainly I think he's up there at the top

02:28.600 --> 02:30.200
too, in my view.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.880
Him and Wittgenstein, I think, are the most important philosophers of the 20th century.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.120
And so I'm really, really looking forward to Heidegger, these series of lectures.

02:40.120 --> 02:45.200
And I hope that you'll be reading along with us as we go through these.

02:45.200 --> 02:49.480
Now, I'm going to be honest with you, as we're reading Being in time, you're going to find

02:49.480 --> 02:52.960
that Heidegger's language is very difficult.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.840
I think it's difficult in a different way than Husserl.

02:55.840 --> 03:01.000
Husserl, I think, part of his difficulty, or at least the part of the difficulty I have

03:01.000 --> 03:06.640
when I read Husserl, just simply consists in terms of his terminological distinctions

03:06.640 --> 03:10.680
and the many, many interrogative statements he seems to put in there.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.920
I think Heidegger is a much cleaner writer.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.920
It's much more beautiful.

03:14.920 --> 03:20.280
But we're going to find that the difficulty with Heidegger's text concerns the very concepts

03:20.280 --> 03:24.480
he's trying to lay bare, because Heidegger, we'll see especially in the introduction

03:24.480 --> 03:33.320
here, believes that our understanding of phenomenology and ultimately our philosophical understanding

03:33.320 --> 03:39.920
of being is itself hampered by all of the philosophical vocabulary and all of the philosophical

03:39.920 --> 03:47.680
language that we become accustomed to that is sort of sedimented and accumulated over

03:47.680 --> 03:52.280
the last couple centuries and over really a couple millennia.

03:52.280 --> 03:56.000
So Heidegger has a more radical task, I think.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.120
But I think you're going to see is that in one sense, once you're able to understand

04:02.120 --> 04:07.120
what Heidegger is doing and being in time, it opens up and it actually becomes very clear

04:07.120 --> 04:08.480
and I think quite beautiful.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.640
So there's something really, really powerful of this philosophy and I think you're going

04:11.640 --> 04:12.640
to enjoy it.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.320
But you're going to have to struggle through it.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.160
I'm not going to lie to you there.

04:16.160 --> 04:21.560
So let's start off with a sort of quick introduction to Martin Heidegger and in terms of his life,

04:21.560 --> 04:25.560
you see I sort of have put together a sort of brief timeline of some of the elements

04:25.560 --> 04:28.200
of Heidegger's life just to give you a sense of who he is.

04:28.200 --> 04:29.200
He lived from 1889.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.720
Well, let me show you a picture of him here.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.720
Here he is.

04:32.720 --> 04:38.320
It's not the best quality picture, or at least the highest quality, but here is Heidegger.

04:38.320 --> 04:44.040
You can see he's maybe not the most beautiful man, as it were, but he certainly looks like

04:44.040 --> 04:46.120
a serious thinker.

04:46.120 --> 04:50.320
Now his life, he lived from 1889 to 1976.

04:50.320 --> 04:58.280
So really he spans the 20th century, most of the 20th century, his life and he actually

04:58.280 --> 05:02.120
lived, of course he never met, but he lives in the same time.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.560
He's born at the same time in which Nietzsche is alive.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.480
And we'll see that although later on in the course here when we talk about the history

05:08.480 --> 05:13.800
of philosophy, we'll see that Heidegger is strongly influenced or at least he recognizes

05:13.800 --> 05:16.680
the importance of Nietzsche's philosophy.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.080
Nietzsche died in 1901.

05:19.080 --> 05:25.840
Now in 1909, Heidegger received his bachelor's degree.

05:25.840 --> 05:32.720
And initially Heidegger had prepared, he was Catholic, and he was preparing to enter the

05:32.720 --> 05:36.680
priesthood and he attended theological seminary.

05:36.680 --> 05:43.760
It wasn't long after he began attending that he really became convinced that he didn't

05:43.760 --> 05:48.400
really want to do theology, he was really interested in doing philosophy rather.

05:48.400 --> 05:57.680
And by 1913, he pursues a doctorate in philosophy and in 1913 his doctoral exam is completed.

05:57.680 --> 06:05.040
His doctoral exam was on the doctrine of judgment and psychologism.

06:05.040 --> 06:10.000
So it's pretty interesting because when we read Husserl, if you recall, Husserl made

06:10.000 --> 06:16.320
a sound critique of psychologism and he really, Husserl wanted to demarcate phenomenology

06:16.320 --> 06:22.480
from psychology and Husserl, of course, was attacked for creating a sort of psychologism,

06:22.480 --> 06:30.720
especially regarding the publication of the latter volumes of the logical investigations.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.800
And there's a debate here, especially you can think here of Frege's critique of Husserl

06:35.800 --> 06:39.760
as really providing sort of psychologism with mathematics.

06:39.760 --> 06:45.400
So it's interesting here because Heidegger is sort of primed and ready in this sort of

06:45.400 --> 06:51.120
discussion by studying psychologism and thinking about what it means to make judgments.

06:51.120 --> 06:59.360
In 1915, Husserl, Heidegger, rather, completes his doctoral dissertation on the doctrine

06:59.360 --> 07:03.720
of categories and the signification in Dunskotis.

07:03.720 --> 07:09.720
Now many of you may not be aware of who Dunskotis was, but Dunskotis was a medieval philosopher

07:10.160 --> 07:16.640
who in many ways begins to articulate an early conception of intentionality and he starts

07:16.640 --> 07:22.320
to lay bare some early conceptions that bear a strong resemblance to phenomenology.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.720
So there's something very, very interesting there in Heidegger's dissertation, though

07:27.720 --> 07:32.040
by no means can talk about it really in this course.

07:32.040 --> 07:38.040
In 1916, Heidegger meets Husserl and eventually begins to study with him and under him and

07:38.040 --> 07:40.760
eventually later you'll see he succeeds Husserl.

07:40.760 --> 07:47.760
In 1918, Heidegger became a private in the military for a year and but by 1919, Heidegger

07:49.120 --> 07:53.880
became an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg.

07:53.880 --> 08:00.320
In 1920, he begins teaching courses on phenomenology in particular and we'll see that like many

08:00.320 --> 08:05.720
of the Greek philosophy, many of the German philosophers from his time, Heidegger is heavily

08:05.760 --> 08:11.480
influenced by a classical reading of Greek philosophy.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.040
You're gonna see as you read being in time, the Heidegger is consistently referring back

08:16.040 --> 08:18.480
to the Greek here.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.120
This course is not in Greek philosophy, so we're not going to spend too much time on

08:22.120 --> 08:27.240
that, but I do encourage you to brush up a little bit on ancient Greek philosophy.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.600
Take a look at, for instance, some of the lectures and metaphysics that I've posted of Aristotle's

08:31.600 --> 08:34.840
metaphysics on the YouTube channel.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.960
In 1923, Heidegger moves to the University of Marburg where he accepted a position at

08:39.960 --> 08:44.960
the University, which is where Husserl was located.

08:44.960 --> 08:51.960
In 1926, so in those three years, Heidegger is teaching vigorously and Heidegger becomes

08:52.160 --> 08:55.480
very, very popular professor.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.920
One of the things that was required though and still is required, you probably heard

08:59.000 --> 09:04.400
of publisher perish at the universities, is that Heidegger wasn't really publishing

09:04.400 --> 09:07.480
lots of books despite his enormous popularity.

09:07.480 --> 09:13.480
You'll see his, not only does he follow in the footsteps of Husserl as a phenomenologist,

09:13.480 --> 09:19.480
but he really begins to radicalize some of the problems that phenomenology can address.

09:19.480 --> 09:25.960
In fact, one of the important lecture courses he gave, and eventually he gets published

09:26.000 --> 09:30.480
and you can read it, is called History of the Concept of Time, which really is, if you

09:30.480 --> 09:33.680
will, sort of first draft of being in time.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.920
But Heidegger was, in the meantime, Heidegger was working on a draft of his sort of major

09:38.920 --> 09:42.880
work called Zein und Zeit, Being in Time.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.640
He was forced eventually by the university to publish it ahead of time.

09:47.640 --> 09:53.320
One of the things interesting is that being in time was actually never fully finished,

09:53.320 --> 09:55.560
which raises some interesting questions for us.

09:55.680 --> 10:02.680
In 1926, Husserl, Heidegger presents Being in Time to Husserl at his 67th birthday party.

10:03.200 --> 10:09.320
And in fact, the book itself is dedicated to Edmund Husserl, so the two are very, very

10:09.320 --> 10:12.320
close friends in 1926.

10:12.320 --> 10:20.320
Now, over the, between 1926 and 1933, there's a lot of amazing work that Heidegger would

10:20.320 --> 10:21.320
do.

10:21.320 --> 10:26.080
He needed to do really, I think, amazing philosophical work throughout most of his life.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.960
But in 1933, he was elected director at the University of Freiburg.

10:30.960 --> 10:35.400
But in the same year, Heidegger joined the National Socialist Party in Germany.

10:35.400 --> 10:41.160
That is, he became a Nazi, and he joined the Nazi party.

10:41.160 --> 10:47.360
And what's more than that, Heidegger actually gave a series of speeches and a series of

10:47.360 --> 10:51.200
talks arguing in favor of the Nazi party.

10:51.200 --> 10:59.680
And especially regarding his, Heidegger especially denounces the Jewish conspiracy in Germany.

10:59.680 --> 11:05.400
And he supported the new laws that the Germans had passed, that had passed under the Nazis,

11:05.400 --> 11:15.800
that it dismissed intellectuals, Jewish intellectuals from serving within academia at the university.

11:15.800 --> 11:20.200
And it's at this time that Husserl is forced to retire for racial reasons.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.960
Husserl was actually a Protestant in terms of his religious affiliation.

11:24.960 --> 11:31.920
But he was Jewish in terms of, he was Jewish, and so he was forced to retire, really quite

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
tragic.

11:32.920 --> 11:38.560
And unfortunately, there's a sort of, there's a lot, there's a big question here about Heidegger's

11:38.560 --> 11:45.440
relationship to Husserl in 1933, which you really see a sort of breakdown, unfortunately.

11:45.440 --> 11:50.600
And of course, I mean, I'm not, this isn't a course on German history, and so I won't

11:50.600 --> 11:56.560
go into all of what happens between 1933 and of course, 44.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.800
But everything basically goes wrong in German culture.

12:00.800 --> 12:07.040
One of the philosophers who actually studied under, and who's also a phenomenologist who

12:07.040 --> 12:09.720
studied under Martin Heidegger is Hannah Arendt.

12:09.720 --> 12:15.160
And Hannah Arendt actually was also Heidegger's lover too.

12:15.160 --> 12:22.960
She was Jewish, and she was also forced to flee Germany despite being German herself.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.520
But she writes a book that I encourage you to take a look at called The Origins of Totalitarianism,

12:27.520 --> 12:33.120
which she looks at, she gives a phenomenological reading to a certain degree.

12:33.120 --> 12:38.200
She has more other texts, which are more phenomenological in nature, but she looks at the question of

12:38.200 --> 12:47.040
what it means for the Germans to have moved into this sort of racial programming, essentially.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.520
So take a look at that text, it's quite interesting.

12:49.520 --> 12:55.520
Now in 1934, though, Heidegger actually resigned his rectorship, and he actually stopped taking

12:55.520 --> 12:57.320
part in the Nazi Party meeting.

12:57.320 --> 13:02.880
So after 34, Heidegger is not, he doesn't, he's not official, he's still an official

13:02.880 --> 13:07.040
Nazi member of the party, or official member of the Nazi Party.

13:07.040 --> 13:13.880
But Heidegger, his role in terms of the Nazis really diminished, and of course, this is

13:13.880 --> 13:21.680
many, many years before the genocide of the Jewish people, and the genocide of others.

13:21.680 --> 13:26.640
So we can't, we're not gonna associate Heidegger, at least I don't associate Heidegger with

13:26.640 --> 13:31.800
the genocide, though it raises important ethical questions regarding his affiliation,

13:31.800 --> 13:36.720
especially because Heidegger refused to recant his Nazi involvement, in fact, his entire

13:36.720 --> 13:37.720
life.

13:37.720 --> 13:44.440
He never regretted being Nazi, and it's hard not to be critical of Heidegger, and I think

13:44.440 --> 13:47.840
we really should be critical in this regard.

13:47.840 --> 13:54.240
Now in 1938, in the midst of World War II, or the beginnings of World War II, Husserl

13:54.240 --> 13:55.240
dies.

13:55.240 --> 14:00.560
And it's really quite tragic because Husserl was prolific writer, a prolific and important

14:00.560 --> 14:05.440
philosopher, and he really created a whole realm of philosophy at the center of which

14:05.440 --> 14:06.440
is Heidegger.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.560
But when Husserl dies, only two professors attend his funeral.

14:12.560 --> 14:19.440
He was really shunned because of his Jewish heritage, which is evil, I think, and tragic.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.440
In 1945, Heidegger survived the war.

14:23.440 --> 14:28.200
People weren't sure if he had survived the war, but he did survive the war.

14:28.200 --> 14:36.000
And a series of denazification hearings begin, in which the Nazi party is disbanded in Germany.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.520
Karl Jaspers, who's an important phenomenologist actually, and a contemporary of Heidegger's.

14:42.520 --> 14:49.480
At one point, Heidegger and Karl Jaspers had had a series of correspondences, but Heidegger

14:49.480 --> 14:50.880
dropped them off.

14:50.880 --> 15:01.680
Well, Jaspers writes a report on Heidegger's involvement, detailing, you might say, Heidegger's

15:01.680 --> 15:07.960
his anti-Jewish work and the sort of the negative things that Heidegger had done.

15:07.960 --> 15:13.720
The University of Freiburg faculty debate Heidegger's involvement in 1945, and by 1946, Heidegger

15:13.720 --> 15:19.480
actually suffers a nervous breakdown that year, but the University of Freiburg faculty

15:19.480 --> 15:25.000
of the University of Freiburg ultimately decided to grant Heidegger faculty emeritus

15:25.000 --> 15:31.640
status, which means that he's still a member of the faculty, retired, as it were.

15:31.640 --> 15:36.400
But he's barred from teaching, so he's banned from teaching any more lectures.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.160
And really, it's because of his involvement in the Nazi party.

15:39.160 --> 15:44.120
By 1951, the ban on teaching is lifted, and Heidegger then begins to give a series of

15:44.120 --> 15:48.040
lectures throughout his career, and throughout the rest of his life, he continued to give

15:48.040 --> 15:51.600
a number of really important lectures that are worth reading.

15:51.600 --> 15:56.320
Tragically, as I mentioned before, Heidegger, at least on my view it's tragic, Heidegger

15:56.320 --> 15:59.760
refuses to recant his Nazi involvement.

15:59.760 --> 16:07.960
In 1976, Heidegger dies, and just a couple days after Heidegger dies, Der Spiegel, which

16:07.960 --> 16:13.320
is a very important publication in Germany, publishes an interview that they conducted

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
with Heidegger.

16:14.600 --> 16:19.200
And one of the things in that interview was they asked Heidegger point blank whether or

16:19.200 --> 16:27.680
not he regretted his involvement as a Nazi with the Nazi National Socialists.

16:27.680 --> 16:32.200
And Heidegger says no, and it's shocking.

16:32.200 --> 16:38.840
The question for us is, how could a philosopher who really provides us fabulous insight philosophically

16:38.840 --> 16:45.160
into the question of being, and really pushes phenomenology into a whole new domain and

16:45.160 --> 16:51.320
becomes really so critical to the rest of the 20th century and 21st century philosophy,

16:51.320 --> 16:58.840
how could such a philosopher become so blind so as not to even regret his involvement with

16:58.840 --> 17:05.760
really one of the darkest stains in human history, politically and especially within

17:05.760 --> 17:06.760
German history.

17:07.080 --> 17:09.640
So it's quite shocking there.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.920
I do think, and I don't really want to spend a lot of time talking about Nazis or National

17:13.920 --> 17:19.400
Socialists in this video, but it raises for us some fundamental questions regarding is

17:19.400 --> 17:24.000
there a relationship between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazism.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.960
Heidegger actually claimed that there was a certain relationship regarding his conception

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
of historicity.

17:28.960 --> 17:35.800
We're not going to go into that right now, but on the other hand, or is his philosophy

17:35.840 --> 17:37.400
really separate from this.

17:37.400 --> 17:42.160
I think it's important to recognize that Heidegger is not giving us Nazi philosophy.

17:42.160 --> 17:47.080
I think that is a misreading of Heidegger's work, but that does raise for us ethical

17:47.080 --> 17:48.080
questions.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.280
And in the early 80s, French phenomenologists raised this question explicitly regarding

17:53.280 --> 18:01.720
whether or not Heidegger's involvement with the Nazis, and especially Heidegger's involvement

18:01.800 --> 18:07.840
regarding who's forced retirement, whether or not that's something we can forgive and

18:07.840 --> 18:09.280
how we should understand that.

18:09.280 --> 18:13.960
So there's something we're talking about here, and maybe at some point in these series

18:13.960 --> 18:17.360
videos we'll talk about it, but you're going to see really what I want to do in these video

18:17.360 --> 18:23.760
lectures is really just take a look at Heidegger's understanding of phenomenology and in his

18:23.760 --> 18:25.760
introduction to being in time.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.400
So let's sort of take a look at that.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.640
We're going to focus really quite heavily on just giving a really detailed reading in

18:32.640 --> 18:36.040
this video of the introduction to being in time.

18:36.040 --> 18:41.400
I imagine this video is going to run long, so feel free to pause the video, take a break

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
as you go through.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.240
Let me take a drink off here.

18:46.240 --> 18:53.400
Now being in time, the German, of course, is Sein und Zeit, was first published in 1927

18:53.400 --> 19:00.560
in the Jahrbuch für Phänomenologie und Phänomenologist Foschum, which is a journal that was actually

19:00.560 --> 19:12.040
edited by Edmund Husserl, so being in time here is first published by Husserl, actually,

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
if you will.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.920
Of course, the book is dedicated to Husserl, and I mentioned this previously, a key preparatory

19:18.920 --> 19:19.920
text.

19:19.920 --> 19:25.120
There is no doubt that being in time is a difficult text to read.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.400
If you would like, I encourage you to take a look at Heidegger's lecture, a history of

19:30.400 --> 19:35.200
the concept of time, which is now published, which really is, if you will, sort of first

19:35.200 --> 19:39.080
draft of being in time, because one of the things you're going to see in being in time

19:39.080 --> 19:44.560
is that Heidegger jettisons our ordinary philosophical vocabulary, and really jettisons

19:44.560 --> 19:52.160
the language that we saw Husserl using completely in order to articulate a new and a fresh,

19:52.160 --> 19:58.080
and I think a more originary conception of Phänomenology and the question of being in

19:58.080 --> 19:59.080
particular.

19:59.080 --> 20:04.760
There's a lot of other great texts that can help you, great texts and commentaries that

20:04.760 --> 20:07.840
can help you understand the history of the concept of time.

20:07.840 --> 20:16.120
My own, there's a great philosopher, contemporary philosopher, Simon Critchley, he's actually

20:16.120 --> 20:25.120
the editor of the New York Times philosophy blog, called The Philosopher's Stone, but

20:25.120 --> 20:31.320
Simon Critchley has a great text on Husserl that was published just a couple years back

20:31.320 --> 20:36.400
on being in time, which really lays out, I think, a really, really fantastic explanation

20:36.400 --> 20:43.360
and commentary of Heidegger, and of course, I was previously, I'm friends with Simon,

20:43.360 --> 20:50.160
with Professor Critchley, and that's my reading of Husserl is very much influenced by Professor

20:50.160 --> 20:51.160
Critchley.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.400
So take a look at that, there's some great stuff in there.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.200
Now, what's the structure of being in time?

20:56.200 --> 20:59.880
Well the basic structure is there's an introduction, that's what we're going to be looking at in

20:59.880 --> 21:01.040
this text.

21:01.040 --> 21:06.440
Part one is called the interpretation of docile in terms of temporality, and the explication

21:06.440 --> 21:09.640
of time is the transcendental horizon for the question of being.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.800
By the end of today's video, you'll have an understanding of what this is talking about,

21:13.800 --> 21:17.440
if you've never read or read Heidegger before.

21:17.440 --> 21:22.960
And then the being in time is actually structured into two different divisions, the preparatory

21:22.960 --> 21:28.200
fundamental analysis of docile, I'm sorry, part one is divided into two divisions, the

21:28.200 --> 21:33.620
preparatory fundamental analysis of docile, and then division two is about docile and

21:33.620 --> 21:35.920
temporality in particular.

21:35.920 --> 21:41.240
Part two of being in time was actually never completed, in fact, the majority of this book

21:41.240 --> 21:46.720
was never completed, partially because Heidegger was forced to rush this into publication in

21:46.720 --> 21:49.920
order for his career, publisher, parish.

21:49.920 --> 21:56.160
You're going to see that Heidegger really structures being in time in a very similar

21:56.160 --> 22:01.800
and definitely a very Germanic way, similar to Husserl who got a series of sections.

22:01.800 --> 22:06.240
Heidegger organized the text as a series of paragraphs and then sections within those.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.920
And this is how Zion Insights is organized.

22:09.920 --> 22:14.000
So let's sort of jump in here and you'll see that before the book even starts, there's

22:14.000 --> 22:17.120
a brief title page in which there's this quotation.

22:17.120 --> 22:22.320
And we're going to see that, although this is a course in phenomenology, Heidegger is

22:22.320 --> 22:24.880
not writing a book on phenomenology.

22:24.880 --> 22:30.920
He is interested in the most important question for him, which is the question of being.

22:30.920 --> 22:35.280
And of course, we know that the philosophy is concerned with lots of things, but at

22:35.280 --> 22:41.680
the core, philosophy is concerned with what it means to exist and what it means for us

22:41.680 --> 22:44.280
to understand things in existence.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.560
All of this ruminates around this concept of being, and we're going to see that this

22:48.560 --> 22:52.040
is the most important question for Heidegger.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.600
So let me tell you, I want to read this passage from you just because this is directly from

22:55.600 --> 23:01.160
the title page here, or right after the title page before he begins the introduction.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.720
And it's quite beautiful, but it sort of gets to the heart at it.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.560
And so let me read this to you.

23:05.560 --> 23:11.080
Heidegger writes, For manifestly, you have been aware of what you mean when you use the

23:11.080 --> 23:13.160
expression being.

23:13.160 --> 23:18.160
We however, who used to think we understood it, have now become perplexed.

23:18.160 --> 23:23.360
Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word being?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.440
Not at all.

23:24.440 --> 23:28.640
So is it fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of being?

23:28.640 --> 23:36.560
But are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression being?

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
Not at all.

23:37.560 --> 23:41.000
So you can see here, he says that on the one hand, we don't even understand the question

23:41.000 --> 23:45.960
of being, what we mean by this term being, but on the other hand, we don't even care,

23:45.960 --> 23:46.960
right?

23:46.960 --> 23:51.840
Our aim in the following treatise in Zang Un Zaitz is to work out the question of the

23:51.840 --> 23:55.720
meaning of being and to do so concretely.

23:55.720 --> 24:01.600
Our provisional aim is the interpretation of time as the possible horizon for any understanding

24:01.600 --> 24:03.680
whatsoever of being.

24:03.680 --> 24:08.920
But the reasons for making this our aim, the investigations, which such a purpose requires

24:08.920 --> 24:13.880
and the path to its achievement, call for some introductory remarks.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.640
So you're going to see this is the beginning of the introduction and you're going to see

24:17.640 --> 24:23.480
that really Heidegger is interested in the question of what being is and he doesn't even

24:23.480 --> 24:27.680
think we even understand what being means or we even know how to ask the question of

24:27.680 --> 24:28.680
being.

24:28.680 --> 24:33.680
And so really being in time is less about being and it's about what it means to ask

24:33.680 --> 24:37.440
the question of the meaning of being itself.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.920
So you're going to see him articulate all of this in the introduction.

24:41.280 --> 24:46.000
I'm going to follow the introduction as closely as I can section by section.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.280
I should emphasize that there's a lot to the introduction and there's a lot of arguments

24:50.280 --> 24:55.000
that Heidegger makes that I'm not going to be talking about simply because I will run

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
out of time.

24:56.000 --> 24:59.840
We're already 24 minutes into the video and we're only now getting to part one.

24:59.840 --> 25:04.840
So I'm not going to cover everything and so I encourage you to read this carefully and

25:04.840 --> 25:09.240
probably to get a commentary text to help you along as well.

25:09.240 --> 25:15.360
Now the introduction begins with paragraph one which is the necessity for explicitly

25:15.360 --> 25:18.320
restating the question of being.

25:18.320 --> 25:24.200
Now the question of being here in the German is called the Zeinsfrage and that just means

25:24.200 --> 25:29.920
question of being, right, the being question and what he wants to say is number one is

25:29.920 --> 25:33.720
that the question of being is a forgotten question.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.240
It's not even something that philosophers are talking about.

25:37.240 --> 25:42.120
Just particularly that Edmund Husserl never really talks about this.

25:42.120 --> 25:47.320
Husserl talks about ontological structures and this sort of stuff and Husserl talks about

25:47.320 --> 25:50.800
existence and he talks about actuality.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.240
Consider for instance how Husserl in our previous lectures here, he talks about the

25:55.240 --> 25:58.960
suspension of our general positing of actuality.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.760
Well, what is actuality?

26:02.760 --> 26:07.200
That's not a question that Husserl asks and he doesn't think that any of the philosophers

26:07.520 --> 26:09.280
are asking this.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.280
This is a forgotten question.

26:11.280 --> 26:14.440
So what exactly is the Zeinsfrage?

26:14.440 --> 26:19.880
What is the question of the meaning of being, all right?

26:19.880 --> 26:24.840
And Husserl starts off, I'm sorry, Heidegger starts off by saying that the question of

26:24.840 --> 26:32.240
being is what is stimulating this ancient Greek research of Plato and Aristotle.

26:33.240 --> 26:42.040
Here, of course, in our introduction to philosophy video series, I give a very sort of cursory

26:42.040 --> 26:46.520
analysis of Plato's theory of the forms and in my history of philosophy course, we talk

26:46.520 --> 26:50.000
a little bit more about Aristotle's metaphysics in more detail.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.840
But we're going to see here that at the core of both Plato and Aristotle's, the question

26:53.840 --> 26:59.720
of what it means to be, what it means to be and Heidegger actually would go on to give

26:59.720 --> 27:04.560
very specific concrete lectures about Plato and Aristotle with regards to the question

27:04.560 --> 27:06.000
of the meaning of being.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.120
We're not going to really review those, but if you do, you will find that Heidegger has

27:11.120 --> 27:16.200
a very, I think, unique analysis of Plato in particular.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.360
He doesn't think that we understand Plato correctly.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.440
Anyway, I'm not going to go into that.

27:20.440 --> 27:29.320
But the meaning of being, the question of what it means to be is at the core of ancient

27:30.320 --> 27:31.320
Greek philosophy.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.280
But things are even worse than we realize because the original contribution of Greek

27:35.280 --> 27:41.960
philosophy, Heidegger argues, has actually sanctioned the neglect of the question of

27:41.960 --> 27:42.960
being.

27:42.960 --> 27:48.120
That is, the Greek philosophy is generated out of this question of what it means to be.

27:48.120 --> 27:52.960
But because we have all of these contributions from these Greek philosophers all the way

27:53.040 --> 28:01.040
from the originary priests of cracks like Parmenides all the way up through Hegel, what we see

28:01.040 --> 28:04.200
is that we've neglected the question of being.

28:04.200 --> 28:10.320
Now, being on the one hand has been said as the most universal concepts, and here I encourage

28:10.320 --> 28:17.760
you to take a look at the work of Thomas Aquinas, who actually focuses quite heavily

28:17.760 --> 28:22.520
on the question of being, and Thomas Aquinas argues this too, is that being is on the one

28:22.600 --> 28:29.080
hand the most universal concept, but it's also the most empty concept, because on the

28:29.080 --> 28:36.360
one hand, everything that we experience and everything we see is a form of being, which

28:36.360 --> 28:38.800
means that everything has been.

28:38.800 --> 28:42.640
But since everything has been, we don't really know what we're talking about.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.520
It's the sort of old idea that if something is everything, then in a certain way it's

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
nothing.

28:48.280 --> 28:53.600
And that's to say that existence clearly is something, it's so universal, but because

28:53.600 --> 28:56.520
of its universality, it's an empty concept.

28:56.520 --> 29:03.360
In fact, it looks like being just simply resists every attempt at definition.

29:03.360 --> 29:09.680
But everyone seems to use this term, and they seem to understand what being means, or as

29:09.680 --> 29:12.760
Heidegger would say, there's so it would seem.

29:12.800 --> 29:18.320
We don't really know what we're talking about, though we have some sort of general intuition.

29:18.320 --> 29:24.400
We have some sort of provisional, obscure, average understanding, but it's insufficient

29:24.400 --> 29:26.600
philosophically.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.960
In section two, and by the way, in all of the video here, whenever I have a pagination,

29:30.960 --> 29:38.720
I'm using the original Heideggerian pagination, and so it's page two here, Heidegger says,

29:38.720 --> 29:44.800
in this way, that which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as something

29:44.800 --> 29:50.200
obscure and hidden, has taken on a sort of clarity and self-evidence, such that if anyone

29:50.200 --> 29:55.000
continues to ask about it, he's charged with an error of method.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.600
So we sort of think that we know we have a handle on what existence and being means,

30:00.600 --> 30:05.640
to the point that, for instance, if you ask a philosopher, they can rattle off a series

30:05.640 --> 30:07.720
of arguments.

30:07.720 --> 30:11.720
For instance, though Heidegger doesn't mention this at all, think about the ontological argument

30:11.720 --> 30:17.640
for God's existence, and think about the use of existence and the use of being in that

30:17.640 --> 30:23.720
discussion, in which it's taken as self-evident what it means for things to exist.

30:23.720 --> 30:28.000
So philosophers are not really thinking about this question, especially when Heidegger is

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
writing.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.480
Now, of course, we're going to see that phenomenology, as prepared by Edmund Husserl, provides

30:34.480 --> 30:38.080
us a way in which to begin to access this question.

30:38.080 --> 30:42.560
But consider the fact that all of the philosophical work that's going on really around the world

30:42.560 --> 30:49.400
at this time, no one is asking this question, not in the way that Heidegger will ask it.

30:49.400 --> 30:53.960
And Heidegger's argument here is that there's so many philosophical prejudices that we have

30:53.960 --> 30:55.400
that they're really too numerous.

30:55.400 --> 31:00.640
There's too many of them that we can adequately deal with at the beginning of being in time.

31:00.640 --> 31:04.720
So we can't really start off and really understand what the meaning of being is, or even what

31:04.720 --> 31:10.640
the question, the Zeinsfraga of being is, the question of being, because we just have

31:10.640 --> 31:13.200
so many philosophical prejudices.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.600
Recall when we looked at Edmund Husserl's work, Husserl talked about the idea that we

31:16.600 --> 31:21.920
had to bracket off all of these theoretical concepts we become accustomed to, and we're

31:21.920 --> 31:26.000
going to see that Heidegger not only agrees with Husserl, but he doesn't think we go far

31:26.000 --> 31:30.480
enough because we can't really uncouple ourselves from them.

31:30.480 --> 31:34.480
So all we really have is a clue to the question of being.

31:34.480 --> 31:38.720
Now in the introduction of being in time, Heidegger begins by sort of signifying, we

31:38.720 --> 31:43.880
have this clue about what the question of being is, but let's lay out what our prejudices

31:43.880 --> 31:46.160
regarding being are.

31:46.160 --> 31:50.400
The first prejudice here is the universal nature of being.

31:50.400 --> 31:56.200
And that's when we say that, when, for instance, Thomas Aquinas says that being is the most

31:56.200 --> 31:59.600
universal concept, well, what kind of, what does that mean here?

31:59.600 --> 32:06.520
And Heidegger sees this as a prejudice, which makes it difficult, or really rather impossible,

32:06.520 --> 32:10.960
for us to begin to think about what we're even talking about.

32:10.960 --> 32:18.360
The first thing here is that Heidegger emphasizes that being is not a universal genus.

32:18.360 --> 32:24.400
You'll recall that when we laid out the distinction between genus and species, the genus is always

32:24.400 --> 32:31.600
a higher category that subsumes particular individual categories.

32:31.600 --> 32:35.520
But the idea here is that when we say that being is universal, we don't mean that being

32:35.520 --> 32:36.880
is a universal genus.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.920
We're not talking about a category at all.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.960
And this is the difficulty here.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.320
For instance, Heidegger mentions that the medieval's refer to being, and they use the

32:46.320 --> 32:51.480
term transcendus, or at least in the Latin formulation, I'm not giving you the Latin

32:51.600 --> 32:54.600
here, but it transcends.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.640
And of course, to transcend is to go beyond.

32:56.640 --> 33:03.600
And it's important here to recognize that the being goes beyond categorization itself.

33:03.600 --> 33:08.800
So being is not a categorical intuition as such.

33:08.800 --> 33:14.960
Now he also mentions that, for instance, Aristotle understood the universality of being really

33:14.960 --> 33:17.120
as a form of analogy.

33:17.160 --> 33:24.640
So when we say that being is universal, we're saying something analogically, because being

33:24.640 --> 33:32.640
is here, and we have genus and species, and universality is a type of genetic category.

33:32.640 --> 33:37.320
But the idea here is that, for at least from Aristotle's perspective, is that this is

33:37.320 --> 33:43.280
not saying it's not a genus, this is an analogical relation here.

33:43.280 --> 33:49.760
And then in this section, as Heidegger discusses the universal nature of being, he talks about

33:49.760 --> 33:53.680
Plato and Aristotle, and he really goes all the way up through Hegel, and talks about

33:53.680 --> 34:01.240
how in Hegel, being becomes an indeterminate, something that's indeterminate in an immediate

34:01.240 --> 34:02.240
sense.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.280
And of course, I'm not going to go through Hegel's logic here, which is actually quite

34:06.280 --> 34:07.480
complex here.

34:07.480 --> 34:10.960
And also remember that Hegel has a work in phenomenology too.

34:10.960 --> 34:15.360
Not the phenomenology that Husserl describes, but the phenomenology of spirit.

34:15.360 --> 34:19.920
And so being is an important category within the phenomenology of spirit, but here it's

34:19.920 --> 34:22.080
indeterminate in the medium.

34:22.080 --> 34:24.080
What exactly does that mean?

34:24.080 --> 34:31.160
Basically, Heidegger's contention is that we don't know, because the history of philosophy

34:31.160 --> 34:36.840
is actually resulted in making being the darkest of all the concepts.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.040
It's not just one genetic category among others.

34:40.040 --> 34:44.080
It's something completely other than that, but the history of philosophy is essentially

34:44.080 --> 34:50.960
shrouded our conception of being by making it a sort of genetic universal category.

34:50.960 --> 34:57.160
Section number two, the second major prejudice here that Heidegger identifies is the indefinability

34:57.160 --> 34:59.560
of being.

34:59.560 --> 35:03.240
Think here about what he just mentioned about Hegel.

35:03.240 --> 35:07.680
Here it's important to recognize that being is not an entity.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.320
And this will become an important thing for us.

35:09.320 --> 35:16.760
When we talk about the existence of something, the being of something, being in and of itself

35:16.760 --> 35:23.400
is not a something at all, because every something is a something only in virtue of its having

35:23.400 --> 35:30.000
being or participating in being or in some way being infused as a being.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.200
But being itself is not an entity.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.320
So we're not talking about a thing at all.

35:36.320 --> 35:40.120
Being is on the one hand, it's not derived from some higher concepts, because if you

35:40.120 --> 35:44.400
will, it's the most universal, right, but analogically.

35:44.400 --> 35:49.280
But then on the second way, being is not presented through these lower concepts either, which

35:49.280 --> 35:58.240
means that we can't uncover our concept of being by looking at conceptual relations.

35:58.240 --> 36:05.440
So a taxonomy of concepts, or for instance, a logical analysis of conceptual relations

36:05.440 --> 36:10.920
in terms of, will never give us insight into this problem of being, right?

36:10.920 --> 36:14.440
There is no definition of being in the ontical sense.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.440
This is a mistake here.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.440
I apologize.

36:16.440 --> 36:20.480
Let's just say ontical, and we'll talk about what that means in a moment here.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.000
Heidegger will actually lay out specific definitions for these things.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.640
And the idea here is that when we talk about the indefinability of being, right, indefinability

36:30.640 --> 36:36.400
demands actually a thorough examination of being, because what is a philosopher to do

36:36.400 --> 36:38.840
when a philosopher doesn't understand something?

36:38.840 --> 36:42.440
It means that they should examine it even closer, right?

36:42.440 --> 36:47.400
And we'll see that this is going to be Heidegger's insistent approach, right?

36:47.400 --> 36:52.920
The third prejudice that Heidegger lays out regarding our inability to think about being

36:52.920 --> 36:55.560
regards the self-evident nature of being, right?

36:55.560 --> 37:00.600
When we talk about, in our experience about things having actuality, well, it just seems

37:00.600 --> 37:03.560
that it's self-evident, right?

37:03.560 --> 37:09.320
And what's important here is that the way in which we comport ourselves to being, or

37:09.320 --> 37:15.680
let's put it this way, self-evident, when I look at something and say, oh, it's just

37:15.680 --> 37:18.320
it exists, it's self-evident, right?

37:18.320 --> 37:23.960
This actually takes us back to a way in which I'm organizing and comporting myself in consciousness

37:23.960 --> 37:25.960
towards being, right?

37:25.960 --> 37:31.160
And of course, a component here, a way in which we can talk about this is think about language.

37:31.160 --> 37:36.360
We're constantly in our language referring to being, and here think about the copula.

37:36.360 --> 37:41.240
A copula is a logical category, which is the category for being, right?

37:41.240 --> 37:47.360
So for the example, the sky is blue, is, is the copula, and what is the copula?

37:47.360 --> 37:50.800
Well, the copula is a demarcation of being, right?

37:50.800 --> 37:57.800
So when I say that I am holding a coffee cup, M refers to being, right?

37:57.800 --> 38:02.640
I'm saying that there's, that I'm saying that the coffee cup has being in my hand.

38:02.640 --> 38:07.240
Well, what does it mean to demarcate being exactly?

38:07.240 --> 38:10.440
What exactly are we talking about, right?

38:10.440 --> 38:15.520
Obviously, I'm talking about a comportment in consciousness, but we're going to see significantly

38:15.520 --> 38:19.120
every comportment is itself a form of being, right?

38:19.120 --> 38:24.320
So the comportment towards entities always uses the concept of being, and this presents

38:24.320 --> 38:32.160
us with what Heidegger calls an a priori enigma, that is, enigma that comes before our experience

38:32.160 --> 38:33.160
itself, right?

38:33.160 --> 38:36.000
A mystery that needs to be addressed.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.840
So self-evidence here is a dubious procedure.

38:38.840 --> 38:44.840
To say that something self-evident is really a way at avoiding the question and the mystery

38:44.840 --> 38:50.960
of the demarcation and the significance of being, and it's a way to dubiously ignore

38:50.960 --> 38:54.560
this a priori enigma, right?

38:54.560 --> 38:58.880
Not only is there no answer to the question of being here, Heidegger says, well, not that

38:58.880 --> 39:02.840
there's not an answer, but not only do we not have an answer to the question of being,

39:02.840 --> 39:06.200
we don't even know what the question is, right?

39:06.200 --> 39:10.480
And so, for instance, is if as I'm talking through this video lecture, you're thinking,

39:10.480 --> 39:11.480
what is he talking about?

39:11.520 --> 39:16.000
What does it mean to ask the question of what existence of being means?

39:16.000 --> 39:21.520
You don't know because we don't even have a grasp on the question of being here itself.

39:21.520 --> 39:26.360
And you're going to see this is in the introduction of being time, because being in time is meant

39:26.360 --> 39:34.400
to give us really a path towards eventually being able to just understand what the question

39:34.400 --> 39:38.600
of being is, just to get us to the point where we can understand what the Zeinsfraga is all

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
about.

39:39.720 --> 39:46.360
Now, paragraph two of the introduction concerns the formal structure of the question of being,

39:46.360 --> 39:47.360
right?

39:47.360 --> 39:50.520
So, on the one hand, we don't know the content of the question of being.

39:50.520 --> 39:56.400
We don't really know what we're asking, but we can recognize that to ask a question, every

39:56.400 --> 39:58.800
question has a structure, right?

39:58.800 --> 40:02.720
Because every question is something that always asks for an answer, right?

40:02.720 --> 40:08.640
So, what is the, can we formulate this question, and then we can ask what belongs to the form

40:08.680 --> 40:10.160
of any question?

40:10.160 --> 40:15.840
Well, Heidegger says, right, is that every inquiry, because a question is to inquire,

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
right?

40:16.840 --> 40:20.160
Every inquiry is a seeking, a sukin, right?

40:20.160 --> 40:25.720
Every inquiry is a seeking, and every seeking is always guided by what is sought, right?

40:25.720 --> 40:28.680
So imagine if I'm looking for my keys, right?

40:28.680 --> 40:34.680
I'm seeking my keys throughout the room, looking, and what is guiding my seeking is what I'm

40:34.680 --> 40:36.120
looking for, right?

40:36.120 --> 40:41.560
So that means that the question of being, whatever it is, right, it's a seeking after

40:41.560 --> 40:45.880
being, and it has to be guided by being itself, right?

40:45.880 --> 40:50.880
So seeking for what being is, and that means we have to seek in regard to the manner of

40:50.880 --> 40:51.880
being.

40:51.880 --> 40:56.840
So, we can start to, as it were, so Heidegger's argument here isn't that the Zionsfrog is

40:56.840 --> 40:58.520
an impossible question.

40:58.520 --> 41:03.680
It's rather that we have to work our way out of our categories, and we can start by formally

41:03.680 --> 41:09.160
understanding that the answer and the question of being itself ultimately has to be guided

41:09.160 --> 41:11.600
by being, right?

41:11.600 --> 41:18.360
So the form of a question always includes A, that which is interrogated.

41:18.360 --> 41:22.120
This is what Heidegger does not use this term, and I think he would object to my using this

41:22.120 --> 41:23.120
term.

41:23.120 --> 41:30.000
What you might say is that the question always, right, moves towards, is looking for a specific

41:30.000 --> 41:31.200
object, right?

41:31.200 --> 41:34.840
It's guided, and it includes that which is interrogated, but it also includes that which

41:34.840 --> 41:37.760
is found out, and here I want to talk about the essence here.

41:37.760 --> 41:42.080
The reason I've included the object and essence here is because I want you to see that there

41:42.080 --> 41:49.040
is a linkage between the Husserlian categories of phenomenology and ideas one in what Husserl

41:49.040 --> 41:50.760
Heidegger is doing here.

41:50.760 --> 41:55.880
Heidegger, for reasons we'll get to in a moment, specifically does not want to use this sort

41:55.880 --> 42:01.160
of language, but it is, I think, helpful for us to, and for at least in this course, I

42:01.160 --> 42:07.320
want you to see the lineage of what Heidegger is doing traces back to Husserl, right?

42:07.320 --> 42:13.040
Now, inquiry to inquire itself is a particular manner of being for a being that inquires,

42:13.040 --> 42:14.040
right?

42:14.040 --> 42:20.360
So remember here is that since, so to just ask any question to inquire itself, only

42:20.360 --> 42:27.240
beings which can inquire can ask questions, right?

42:27.240 --> 42:34.200
And that means that as a being that can inquire, when I make an inquiry, I'm actually taking

42:34.200 --> 42:37.160
on a particular manner of being, right?

42:37.160 --> 42:40.240
I'm existing in a certain sort of way, right?

42:40.240 --> 42:44.560
Here you can think about maybe Husserl's categories of noesis, it's a type of noema,

42:44.560 --> 42:46.880
for instance, inquiry, right?

42:46.880 --> 42:53.360
Now, Husserl is not, Heidegger is not going to follow Husserl along those lines, right?

42:53.360 --> 43:00.360
And in a certain way, you can see here, there's a sort of tragedy regarding Husserl's view

43:00.360 --> 43:05.160
of what phenology was to become, because in a certain way, it gets dismantled to some

43:05.160 --> 43:06.520
degree by Heidegger, right?

43:06.520 --> 43:11.760
But back to the point, inquiry itself is a particular manner of being for a being that

43:11.760 --> 43:12.760
inquires.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.200
Oops, let's go back there, right?

43:15.200 --> 43:20.440
Now since we have some access to the concept of being, because we do have the copula, we

43:20.440 --> 43:25.800
do use these concepts, that means that there must be a way to inquire about it.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.400
You can see this is what Heidegger would call our average every day, of vague, I don't know

43:29.400 --> 43:30.400
what it's right here.

43:30.400 --> 43:36.840
This is what we call a vague average understanding, or an average every day understanding of being.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.000
So what is being?

43:38.000 --> 43:43.040
Well, Heidegger says, what we need to do is we need to know what the horizon for that

43:43.040 --> 43:45.360
very question is, right?

43:45.360 --> 43:50.400
And by horizon here, think about the language that Husserl used here to talk about, you

43:50.400 --> 43:54.600
know, the conditions for the possibility of the question, right?

43:54.600 --> 44:00.360
What we do know, for instance, about being is that being determines the entities as entities.

44:00.360 --> 44:05.520
So anything can be an entity, everything from the coffee shop to the mirror behind me, to

44:05.520 --> 44:06.680
me, right?

44:06.680 --> 44:13.440
All of this is being, and we know that being is what determines an entity as an entity.

44:13.440 --> 44:17.400
So you can't be an entity if you don't have being, right?

44:17.400 --> 44:21.080
But being, like we said earlier, is not an entity in itself, right?

44:21.080 --> 44:22.080
So what does this mean?

44:22.080 --> 44:29.200
Well, it means that the Zeinsfraga is not a question, to address the Zeinsfraga, it's

44:29.200 --> 44:33.160
not a question of trying to tell a story or trace an origin.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.160
Why?

44:34.160 --> 44:37.680
Because only entities have origins, right?

44:37.680 --> 44:44.520
So we're not going to be trying to link it back to some sort of start with an entity

44:44.520 --> 44:47.800
and work our way backwards to the question of being.

44:47.800 --> 44:53.640
In a certain way, this is a way in which you might, for instance, understand the defunct

44:53.640 --> 45:00.280
nature of the problems regarding first movers and all of this sort of stuff that you may

45:00.280 --> 45:06.560
have heard of, or you can take a look at regarding, for instance, Thomas Aquinas' or Aristotle

45:06.560 --> 45:07.560
here, right?

45:07.560 --> 45:10.480
In which there's a sort of tracing towards origin.

45:10.480 --> 45:14.640
Heinegger as explicit as we can't do that here, right?

45:14.640 --> 45:21.240
On six, he says, hence being, as that which is asked about, must be exhibited in a way

45:21.240 --> 45:26.840
of its own, and this is essentially different from the way in which entities themselves

45:26.840 --> 45:28.280
are discovered, right?

45:28.280 --> 45:35.560
So that means we need to find a way to understand being that is, that remains faithful or has

45:35.560 --> 45:38.920
a fidelity towards being itself, right?

45:38.920 --> 45:42.680
So that's why we can't tell a story because you can only tell stories of entities and

45:42.680 --> 45:45.080
we have to be faithful to being as itself.

45:45.080 --> 45:48.080
Now what are the different ways in which we recognize being?

45:48.080 --> 45:50.920
Well, everything we talk about, right?

45:50.920 --> 45:55.800
Everything we have in view, all of the things we comport ourselves towards, right?

45:55.800 --> 45:59.840
We're being, how we are is being, right?

45:59.840 --> 46:03.120
The inquiry itself is a manner of being.

46:03.120 --> 46:06.920
When we talk about something having reality, we're talking about being, right?

46:06.920 --> 46:11.360
And think here about, I can talk about the reality of that which is outside of me, but

46:11.360 --> 46:16.440
I can also talk about the reality of the presentations I have in consciousness, for instance.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.200
All of those are real, all of those have being, right?

46:20.200 --> 46:25.040
That something is, and we're talking about reality, what is present hand, right, before

46:25.040 --> 46:26.040
me?

46:26.040 --> 46:28.240
What subsistence means?

46:28.240 --> 46:31.880
Even validity is a way in which we recognize being.

46:31.880 --> 46:36.520
And think here, if you want, take a look at my series on Introduction to Formal Logic,

46:36.880 --> 46:41.000
and we talk about the validity of argumentative propositions, right?

46:41.000 --> 46:44.320
Or for instance, quantificational validity.

46:44.320 --> 46:49.240
To say that something is valid is to demarcate a form of being, right?

46:49.240 --> 46:52.000
It's to say that something is, right?

46:52.000 --> 46:56.400
So when we talk about there being something is, or we're talking about something given,

46:56.400 --> 46:58.520
we're always recognizing being.

46:58.520 --> 47:04.800
So whatever point of departure we're going to make towards being, we have to recognize

47:04.800 --> 47:07.360
that these different manners, right?

47:07.360 --> 47:11.880
So from which of the entities is the disclosure of being taken?

47:11.880 --> 47:12.880
What has the priority?

47:12.880 --> 47:18.600
Well, Heidegger says to understand being, we have to understand how we look at being.

47:18.600 --> 47:25.840
In other words, we need to uncover the nature of the being that we ourselves are, right?

47:25.840 --> 47:32.600
Because since being is something that's recognized by us, and that recognition is a form of being,

47:32.600 --> 47:39.040
we can't understand what being is in itself, we have to first begin and uncover what being

47:39.040 --> 47:43.720
means for the being, for whom being is a question, right?

47:43.720 --> 47:49.560
We're going to see this as an explicit reference to an important concept of Heidegger's, okay?

47:49.560 --> 47:54.960
Now this, and this is the concept, Dasein, right?

47:54.960 --> 47:59.960
Heidegger writes on seven, this entity, which each of us is, is himself, and which includes

47:59.960 --> 48:05.280
inquiring as one of the possibilities being, we're going to denote by the term Dasein.

48:05.280 --> 48:11.040
Now in German, Dasein, you can see here, Zein is the term for being, and Da means to point,

48:11.040 --> 48:12.040
right?

48:12.040 --> 48:15.120
So here it means something like to point to being, and what he means to say is that we're

48:15.120 --> 48:17.360
going to call ourselves Dasein.

48:17.360 --> 48:22.280
Now later on, in just a minute, Heidegger's going to really say, and this is what I want

48:22.280 --> 48:27.360
you to memorize here, is that whenever you say what is being, what is Dasein, Dasein

48:27.360 --> 48:31.440
is the being, for whom being is an issue.

48:31.440 --> 48:36.360
Now that means that all human beings who can ask the question of being, and who can recognize

48:36.360 --> 48:37.440
being are Dasein.

48:37.440 --> 48:40.920
So he's talking about us, Dasein is his term for the human.

48:40.920 --> 48:47.240
Now he doesn't use the term human here, because by using the term Dasein, he's signifying

48:47.240 --> 48:52.800
the, the being of the person who inquires after being, right?

48:52.800 --> 48:57.200
So he's giving this new term, this new language.

48:57.200 --> 49:02.920
In many ways, you're going to see that being in time operates almost lexinographically,

49:02.920 --> 49:08.880
and it operates as a lexicon of concepts for thinking about how, what being is, and what

49:08.880 --> 49:09.880
it means for us.

49:09.880 --> 49:14.360
Now, Heidegger recognizes there might be a problem here, that is, is there a circularity?

49:14.360 --> 49:18.040
Because are we really just saying we're going to understand being by understanding being,

49:18.040 --> 49:19.040
right?

49:19.040 --> 49:25.280
And, and Heidegger's response here is, well, that factically, there is no circle at all,

49:25.280 --> 49:26.280
right?

49:26.360 --> 49:31.040
Because when we look at the actuality of ourselves, the facticity of ourselves, and we'll see

49:31.040 --> 49:36.720
later in the book, Heidegger will explicitly define facticity, though I'm not going to

49:36.720 --> 49:41.760
do it now, is when we look to how we actually exist, we recognize that we can determine

49:41.760 --> 49:47.200
the nature of an entity's being without first formulating the meaning of being itself, right?

49:47.200 --> 49:51.640
That is, it's not circularity, but it's a relatedness between the backwards and the

49:51.640 --> 49:58.240
forwardness of our inquiring nature of being as beings.

49:58.240 --> 50:00.040
This stuff is difficult, I know.

50:00.040 --> 50:04.680
So I hope this is helping, and I hope this, this is at least laying clear some of these

50:04.680 --> 50:05.680
concepts.

50:05.680 --> 50:11.760
Now, paragraph three is known as the ontological priority of the question of being.

50:11.760 --> 50:15.440
Now, what he's going to argue here, and you'll see the ontology is going to play an important

50:15.440 --> 50:17.480
role here, and we'll get to this in a minute.

50:17.480 --> 50:22.600
Now, when we talk about this question of being, we can ask, is the Zeinsfrager the question

50:22.600 --> 50:27.440
of being a matter of speculation, or is it a matter of the most basic and concrete of

50:27.440 --> 50:29.320
all possible questions?

50:29.320 --> 50:34.720
Of course, he doesn't think it's just speculation, he actually thinks it is a concrete question.

50:34.720 --> 50:41.480
The problem is, it's a concrete question, but it's so concrete and so basic, and then

50:41.480 --> 50:46.480
coupled on top of it with the history of our theoretical concepts and philosophy, we just

50:46.480 --> 50:51.680
don't know what that concretizing thing is, right?

50:51.680 --> 50:57.720
So the task here is to understand the constitution of entities, because every entity has being,

50:57.720 --> 51:05.240
so the constitution of any entity ultimately must trace back to being, or as it were, right?

51:05.240 --> 51:09.000
So the task is to understand the constitution of entities in their most basic sense, and

51:09.000 --> 51:12.680
this is what a science is doing ultimately, right?

51:12.680 --> 51:15.560
And Heidegger here actually discusses the role of the sciences.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.720
He talks about the crisis of science in his day, or in I think would still be today, and

51:20.720 --> 51:25.080
he mentions, for instance, the crisis in mathematics, we can talk about formalism and intuitionism,

51:25.080 --> 51:30.120
but he goes on to talk about mathematics, physics, biology, the historical human sciences,

51:30.120 --> 51:33.800
theology, and so forth.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.120
All of these have a crisis, and what's the crisis?

51:36.120 --> 51:42.760
The crisis refers to the idea that none of these sciences are able to articulate what

51:42.760 --> 51:47.080
it means to evaluate the things themselves, right?

51:47.080 --> 51:51.280
So for instance, mathematics is looking at mathematical concepts that have validity,

51:51.280 --> 51:52.280
right?

51:52.280 --> 51:56.280
That's a type of being, but what exactly is that mathematics can't tell us?

51:56.280 --> 51:59.120
The same things with physics and center, right?

51:59.120 --> 52:04.760
He has a quotation here on 10, quote, basic concepts determine the way in which we get

52:04.760 --> 52:09.840
an understanding beforehand of the area of subject matter, underline all the objects

52:09.840 --> 52:15.480
the science takes as its themes, and all the positive investigation is guided by this

52:15.480 --> 52:16.480
understanding.

52:16.480 --> 52:21.760
Only after this area itself has been explored beforehand in a corresponding manner do these

52:21.760 --> 52:25.840
concepts become genuinely demonstrated as grounded.

52:25.840 --> 52:30.160
So you can see here is that what he's going to say is that the sciences today are in crisis

52:30.160 --> 52:36.960
because they have no grounding in their understanding of the copula, right, of being, of continuing

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
on.

52:37.960 --> 52:43.720
And in every such area, every science is itself obtained from the domain of entities themselves.

52:43.720 --> 52:49.400
This preliminary research from which the basic concepts are drawn signifies nothing else

52:49.400 --> 52:54.960
than an interpretation of those entities with regard to their basic state of being.

52:54.960 --> 53:00.440
Such research must run ahead of the positive sciences as Andy can.

53:00.440 --> 53:03.520
Here the work of Plato and Aristotle's evidence enough, right?

53:03.520 --> 53:07.520
You can see that Plato and Aristotle without any science, any conception of modern science

53:07.520 --> 53:13.640
or any of the work that was laid out by the later scientists, right, they're able to begin

53:13.640 --> 53:14.640
to address this.

53:14.640 --> 53:19.760
So we can, in fact, begin to try to understand the grounding of the sciences by looking at

53:19.760 --> 53:24.320
being other philosophers have done so, and we too can do it, right?

53:24.320 --> 53:27.200
And this would hold for theology as well.

53:27.200 --> 53:33.120
Now the crisis of the sciences require an examination of what it means for something

53:33.120 --> 53:35.400
to be as they're given.

53:35.400 --> 53:39.200
Now this is the discussion of ontology, right?

53:39.200 --> 53:44.960
And in a really general sense, what you can say is that ontology is the, is, refers to

53:44.960 --> 53:49.960
the logic of being, right, ontos being in Greek there, right?

53:49.960 --> 53:55.440
And so what you might say is that ontology refers to the relations that beings have with

53:55.440 --> 53:56.880
each other and with themselves.

53:56.880 --> 54:01.600
Now Heidegger is doing a fundamental ontology at the, or he wants to get to a fundamental

54:01.600 --> 54:04.120
ontology with designs froga.

54:04.120 --> 54:08.960
Now Heidegger makes a distinction here between ontology versus what he calls the ontical,

54:08.960 --> 54:11.480
or the ontic, right?

54:11.480 --> 54:15.520
And this is sometimes referred to as the ontological distinction, right?

54:15.520 --> 54:22.280
The ontology refers concerns being itself, whereas the ontical concerns entity, the being

54:22.280 --> 54:24.520
of entities themselves, right?

54:24.520 --> 54:29.760
So if we're talking about ontology in its most radical sense, we're talking about being

54:29.760 --> 54:30.760
in and of itself.

54:30.880 --> 54:36.960
If we're talking about ontics, we're talking about the being of specific sorts of entities.

54:36.960 --> 54:42.320
So for instance, you can say that if we go back to Edmund Hustrel's discussion of consciousness,

54:42.320 --> 54:44.040
all of that was ontical.

54:44.040 --> 54:48.480
It wasn't ontology proper, right?

54:48.480 --> 54:57.400
And the same thing would go for any number of philosophers we could name, right?

54:57.720 --> 55:03.800
All ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at

55:03.800 --> 55:10.000
its disposal, remains blind and is perverted from its own most aim.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.840
If it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of being and conceived this clarification

55:16.840 --> 55:19.040
as its fundamental task, right?

55:19.040 --> 55:24.920
So all of the things that the ontologies we've seen previously were actually ontical because

55:25.320 --> 55:30.440
the ontology itself, being itself, the meaning of being, is never answered or clarified.

55:32.200 --> 55:38.440
OK, so now we're going to move to the paragraph four, where Heidegger discusses the

55:38.440 --> 55:42.440
ontical priority of the question of being, right?

55:43.520 --> 55:50.120
Now, science in general refers to the totality of established interconnections of true

55:50.120 --> 55:53.160
propositions within a specific domain, right?

55:53.400 --> 55:54.400
So that's what science is.

55:54.400 --> 55:59.240
And you're going to see that the Heidegger is giving a science here, but he's giving

55:59.240 --> 56:02.280
an originary conception of what a science means.

56:02.280 --> 56:07.640
A science in general is this totality of established interconnections of true propositions.

56:07.640 --> 56:12.640
The question of establishment here ultimately goes back to the type of science we're looking at,

56:12.640 --> 56:13.160
right?

56:13.160 --> 56:18.520
So how a chemist establishes true propositions in their interconnections differs from how

56:18.520 --> 56:20.120
a mathematician does, right?

56:20.120 --> 56:24.280
But they're both doing the same thing in a general level, as it were, right?

56:24.440 --> 56:28.600
But the science of beings, but what about the science?

56:28.600 --> 56:36.280
But science has the has the being of its entities, and that is every science ultimately also

56:36.280 --> 56:46.440
includes the manner of being of which is the of which is the occurrence of the

56:46.440 --> 56:48.280
inquire or the sciences themselves.

56:48.400 --> 56:57.200
In other words, that the science has an ontical theme, which is determined by the

56:57.200 --> 57:01.040
scientist, because the scientist is the person who's doing the inquiring.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.760
So remember, we talked about inquiring as a manner of being.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.960
Well, that filters into science, which means that the science has the being of its

57:08.960 --> 57:11.720
entities that has its being of us or Dawson.

57:12.040 --> 57:19.120
So what distinguishes Dawson ontically is that that is that being is an issue for it, right?

57:19.280 --> 57:22.880
Or being in such a way that one has an understanding of being, right?

57:23.960 --> 57:28.840
Now, the kind of being that Dawson can comport itself towards is designated by the term

57:28.840 --> 57:29.440
existence.

57:29.440 --> 57:37.840
So when I comport myself towards the coffee cup here, right, that comportment is designated

57:37.840 --> 57:39.240
by existence, right?

57:39.240 --> 57:41.520
That's what I mean by existence, right?

57:41.520 --> 57:46.080
And think here about when if I don't know something exists, I don't know it exists

57:46.080 --> 57:51.280
because I can't comport myself towards it, at least in a sort of kind of concrete

57:51.280 --> 57:51.840
fashion.

57:53.480 --> 57:59.600
Heidegger writes Dawson always understands itself in terms of its existence, in terms

57:59.600 --> 58:03.040
of a possibility of itself to be itself or not itself.

58:03.240 --> 58:08.040
Here, of course, I think of Shakespeare to be or not to be Dawson has either chosen

58:08.040 --> 58:14.800
these possibilities itself or got itself into them or grown up in them already, right?

58:14.800 --> 58:19.600
So, so how exactly Dawson gets in this, we're not sure, but there's these different ways.

58:20.160 --> 58:25.080
Only the particular Dawson decides its existence, whether it does so by taking

58:25.080 --> 58:30.520
hold or by neglecting the question of existence never gets straightened out, except

58:30.520 --> 58:32.600
through existing itself.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.520
And here's quite fascinating, right?

58:34.840 --> 58:42.240
This is the idea here is that one cannot recognize existence, except through a manner

58:42.240 --> 58:44.200
of existing, right?

58:44.680 --> 58:48.360
You can see here, it's a similar sort of question to this problem of being.

58:49.120 --> 58:53.960
Now, Heidegger is now going to start to give us a range of categories and lay out what

58:53.960 --> 58:54.920
these categories are.

58:55.720 --> 59:00.920
The understanding of oneself by existence is called what he calls the existential,

59:01.360 --> 59:02.760
existential, right?

59:03.480 --> 59:04.480
Let's see, let's move here.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.440
And here's a list of categories, right?

59:06.680 --> 59:12.120
So existence here refers to that which Dawson comports itself towards, right?

59:12.520 --> 59:16.760
The existential is the understanding of itself by Dawson.

59:17.480 --> 59:24.280
Existentiality refers to the structures of existence and existential refers to the

59:24.280 --> 59:27.040
analytic of existentiality, right?

59:27.040 --> 59:31.680
That refers to the analytic of the structures of existence and the understanding

59:31.720 --> 59:35.800
of itself by Dawson is existential, right?

59:36.240 --> 59:41.120
So he's sort of laying out these terms, which can be confusing, but I hope you'll see

59:41.120 --> 59:43.880
there's a rigorous formulation to what he's doing here.

59:44.680 --> 59:49.240
At the end of the day, what we can say is that being in the world is something that

59:49.240 --> 59:52.760
belongs to Dawson existentially, right?

59:52.800 --> 01:00:00.360
That is the analytic of the structure of existence for Dawson is that Dawson is a

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.960
being in the world.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:08.080
All of us are always already thrown into the world as it were, right?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.080
We're living in a world and we can't separate ourselves from that.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.160
And so if we want to understand Dawson's existential, right?

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.920
Then we have to recognize that Dawson is a being in the world.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:26.440
And we're going to see later on in subsequent videos that this will this this

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.400
insight of our being in the world as a preliminary structural category for

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:38.960
Dawson is going to allow Heidegger to lay out structurally his formal analysis of

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.640
Dawson, okay?

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.440
So on 13 he says, therefore fundamental ontology, right?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.080
Remember the ontological distinction from which alone all other ontologies can take

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.080
their rise must be sought in the existential analytic of Dawson, right?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.320
That has to be sought out in the way in which we are beings in the world.

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.320
The way in which we have, we're a manner of being towards things that exist, right?

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.840
Now that means that Dawson takes priority here in terms of articulating the meaning

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.080
of the question of being, right?

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.720
And so Heidegger lays out, he says, really when we talk about this priority,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.600
there's three things that go along.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.600
On the one hand, there's the ontical priority where Dawson is an entity whose

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.520
being has the determinant character of existence, right?

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.240
So Dawson is something that existing, but there's the ontological priority in

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.440
which Dawson is in itself ontological because existence is that's

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.840
determinative for it.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.200
Remember Dawson is the being for whom being is an issue.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.920
And then there's the ontico ontological priority in which Dawson also possesses as

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.240
constitutive for its understanding of existence, an understanding of the being

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.080
of all entities of a character other than its own, right?

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:03.480
So there's these sorts of three categories that Heidegger is going to use within the text.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:06.840
Now, let me give you here this great quote from Heidegger here, which is quote,

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.720
if to interpret the meaning of being becomes our task, Dawson is not only the

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:17.760
primary entity to be interrogated, it is also the entity which already comports

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.680
itself and it's being towards what we're asking about when we ask this question.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.840
So let's get moving here.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:27.280
Okay.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:33.280
Now, now this is section two of the introduction and I've already gone an hour.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.680
So here's what I'm going to do as I'm going to stop right now.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:42.320
And in the next video, I will complete our understanding are, I will complete the

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.480
video on the second part of the introduction of being in time.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.720
Thanks again for watching.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.080
I look forward to seeing you guys online.
