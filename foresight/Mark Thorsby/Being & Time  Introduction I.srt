00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi, this is Phenomenology, and I'm Mark Thorsby.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,600
Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,600
I hope you're doing well.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,640
In this video, we're going to be taking a look at the introduction to Martin Heidegger's

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,080
seminal text, Being in Time, or in the German Sein und Zeit.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
So welcome back, everyone.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,560
I hope you're doing well.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,360
So what we're going to be taking a look at here is, so far in this course, we've looked

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:34,680
at Edmund Husserl's text, Ideas 1, or an analysis of what pure phenomenology looks like.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
And we've chosen that.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,280
We chose that text, or I chose that text, because I wanted you to get a nice and a solid

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,160
understanding of what phenomenology is in its most basic and originary conception.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,640
We're going to see here that really starting with this video is we're going to be looking

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,120
at phenomenology after Husserl.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,960
Now, there's a lot of phenomenologists who follow Husserl, but probably the most important

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,200
and certainly the most impactful of these philosophers was Martin Heidegger.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,160
Martin Heidegger not only studied directly with Husserl, but he even, his magnum opus

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,560
text, which here is Being in Time, he actually dedicates to Edmund Husserl, but we're going

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:27,600
to see that Heidegger, I think, really goes beyond Husserl and succeeds his master, as

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
it were.

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,800
And we're going to see that whereas Husserl's attitude and his philosophy we looked at was

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,120
really about the articulation of phenomenology and laying bare the science of phenomenology

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,920
as he saw it, in terms of what phenomenology does, how it operates, etc., etc., and what's

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,800
up in the principal themes and discoveries that phenomenology can offer us.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,240
We're going to see here that for Heidegger, who's a phenomenologist, phenomenology becomes

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,240
a method for addressing the most important question for him, or the most forgotten question,

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,760
which is the question of Being.

28
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,960
And so we're going to see that he really radicalizes phenomenology in a way that is so pivotal

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,160
and so that really impacts a philosophy.

30
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,240
In many ways, I think, one could argue, indeed, people have argued that Heidegger is really

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,680
one of the most important, if not the most important, philosopher of the 20th century.

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,600
I don't know about the most important, but certainly I think he's up there at the top

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
too, in my view.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,880
Him and Wittgenstein, I think, are the most important philosophers of the 20th century.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,120
And so I'm really, really looking forward to Heidegger, these series of lectures.

36
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,200
And I hope that you'll be reading along with us as we go through these.

37
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,480
Now, I'm going to be honest with you, as we're reading Being in time, you're going to find

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,960
that Heidegger's language is very difficult.

39
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,840
I think it's difficult in a different way than Husserl.

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,000
Husserl, I think, part of his difficulty, or at least the part of the difficulty I have

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,640
when I read Husserl, just simply consists in terms of his terminological distinctions

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,680
and the many, many interrogative statements he seems to put in there.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,920
I think Heidegger is a much cleaner writer.

44
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
It's much more beautiful.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,280
But we're going to find that the difficulty with Heidegger's text concerns the very concepts

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,480
he's trying to lay bare, because Heidegger, we'll see especially in the introduction

47
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:33,320
here, believes that our understanding of phenomenology and ultimately our philosophical understanding

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,920
of being is itself hampered by all of the philosophical vocabulary and all of the philosophical

49
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,680
language that we become accustomed to that is sort of sedimented and accumulated over

50
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,280
the last couple centuries and over really a couple millennia.

51
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,000
So Heidegger has a more radical task, I think.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,120
But I think you're going to see is that in one sense, once you're able to understand

53
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,120
what Heidegger is doing and being in time, it opens up and it actually becomes very clear

54
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
and I think quite beautiful.

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,640
So there's something really, really powerful of this philosophy and I think you're going

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
to enjoy it.

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,320
But you're going to have to struggle through it.

58
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,160
I'm not going to lie to you there.

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,560
So let's start off with a sort of quick introduction to Martin Heidegger and in terms of his life,

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,560
you see I sort of have put together a sort of brief timeline of some of the elements

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,200
of Heidegger's life just to give you a sense of who he is.

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
He lived from 1889.

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,720
Well, let me show you a picture of him here.

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Here he is.

65
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,320
It's not the best quality picture, or at least the highest quality, but here is Heidegger.

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,040
You can see he's maybe not the most beautiful man, as it were, but he certainly looks like

67
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,120
a serious thinker.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,320
Now his life, he lived from 1889 to 1976.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,280
So really he spans the 20th century, most of the 20th century, his life and he actually

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,120
lived, of course he never met, but he lives in the same time.

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,560
He's born at the same time in which Nietzsche is alive.

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,480
And we'll see that although later on in the course here when we talk about the history

73
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,800
of philosophy, we'll see that Heidegger is strongly influenced or at least he recognizes

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,680
the importance of Nietzsche's philosophy.

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,080
Nietzsche died in 1901.

76
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,840
Now in 1909, Heidegger received his bachelor's degree.

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,720
And initially Heidegger had prepared, he was Catholic, and he was preparing to enter the

78
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,680
priesthood and he attended theological seminary.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,760
It wasn't long after he began attending that he really became convinced that he didn't

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,400
really want to do theology, he was really interested in doing philosophy rather.

81
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,680
And by 1913, he pursues a doctorate in philosophy and in 1913 his doctoral exam is completed.

82
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,040
His doctoral exam was on the doctrine of judgment and psychologism.

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,000
So it's pretty interesting because when we read Husserl, if you recall, Husserl made

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,320
a sound critique of psychologism and he really, Husserl wanted to demarcate phenomenology

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,480
from psychology and Husserl, of course, was attacked for creating a sort of psychologism,

86
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:30,720
especially regarding the publication of the latter volumes of the logical investigations.

87
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,800
And there's a debate here, especially you can think here of Frege's critique of Husserl

88
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,760
as really providing sort of psychologism with mathematics.

89
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,400
So it's interesting here because Heidegger is sort of primed and ready in this sort of

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,120
discussion by studying psychologism and thinking about what it means to make judgments.

91
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:59,360
In 1915, Husserl, Heidegger, rather, completes his doctoral dissertation on the doctrine

92
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,720
of categories and the signification in Dunskotis.

93
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Now many of you may not be aware of who Dunskotis was, but Dunskotis was a medieval philosopher

94
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,640
who in many ways begins to articulate an early conception of intentionality and he starts

95
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,320
to lay bare some early conceptions that bear a strong resemblance to phenomenology.

96
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,720
So there's something very, very interesting there in Heidegger's dissertation, though

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,040
by no means can talk about it really in this course.

98
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,040
In 1916, Heidegger meets Husserl and eventually begins to study with him and under him and

99
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,760
eventually later you'll see he succeeds Husserl.

100
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,760
In 1918, Heidegger became a private in the military for a year and but by 1919, Heidegger

101
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,880
became an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Freiburg.

102
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,320
In 1920, he begins teaching courses on phenomenology in particular and we'll see that like many

103
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,720
of the Greek philosophy, many of the German philosophers from his time, Heidegger is heavily

104
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,480
influenced by a classical reading of Greek philosophy.

105
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,040
You're gonna see as you read being in time, the Heidegger is consistently referring back

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,480
to the Greek here.

107
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,120
This course is not in Greek philosophy, so we're not going to spend too much time on

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,240
that, but I do encourage you to brush up a little bit on ancient Greek philosophy.

109
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,600
Take a look at, for instance, some of the lectures and metaphysics that I've posted of Aristotle's

110
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,840
metaphysics on the YouTube channel.

111
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,960
In 1923, Heidegger moves to the University of Marburg where he accepted a position at

112
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,960
the University, which is where Husserl was located.

113
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,960
In 1926, so in those three years, Heidegger is teaching vigorously and Heidegger becomes

114
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,480
very, very popular professor.

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,920
One of the things that was required though and still is required, you probably heard

116
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,400
of publisher perish at the universities, is that Heidegger wasn't really publishing

117
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,480
lots of books despite his enormous popularity.

118
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,480
You'll see his, not only does he follow in the footsteps of Husserl as a phenomenologist,

119
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,480
but he really begins to radicalize some of the problems that phenomenology can address.

120
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,960
In fact, one of the important lecture courses he gave, and eventually he gets published

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
and you can read it, is called History of the Concept of Time, which really is, if you

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,680
will, sort of first draft of being in time.

123
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,920
But Heidegger was, in the meantime, Heidegger was working on a draft of his sort of major

124
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,880
work called Zein und Zeit, Being in Time.

125
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,640
He was forced eventually by the university to publish it ahead of time.

126
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,320
One of the things interesting is that being in time was actually never fully finished,

127
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,560
which raises some interesting questions for us.

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,680
In 1926, Husserl, Heidegger presents Being in Time to Husserl at his 67th birthday party.

129
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,320
And in fact, the book itself is dedicated to Edmund Husserl, so the two are very, very

130
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,320
close friends in 1926.

131
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Now, over the, between 1926 and 1933, there's a lot of amazing work that Heidegger would

132
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
do.

133
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,080
He needed to do really, I think, amazing philosophical work throughout most of his life.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,960
But in 1933, he was elected director at the University of Freiburg.

135
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,400
But in the same year, Heidegger joined the National Socialist Party in Germany.

136
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,160
That is, he became a Nazi, and he joined the Nazi party.

137
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,360
And what's more than that, Heidegger actually gave a series of speeches and a series of

138
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,200
talks arguing in favor of the Nazi party.

139
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:59,680
And especially regarding his, Heidegger especially denounces the Jewish conspiracy in Germany.

140
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,400
And he supported the new laws that the Germans had passed, that had passed under the Nazis,

141
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:15,800
that it dismissed intellectuals, Jewish intellectuals from serving within academia at the university.

142
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,200
And it's at this time that Husserl is forced to retire for racial reasons.

143
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,960
Husserl was actually a Protestant in terms of his religious affiliation.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,920
But he was Jewish in terms of, he was Jewish, and so he was forced to retire, really quite

145
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
tragic.

146
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,560
And unfortunately, there's a sort of, there's a lot, there's a big question here about Heidegger's

147
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:45,440
relationship to Husserl in 1933, which you really see a sort of breakdown, unfortunately.

148
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,600
And of course, I mean, I'm not, this isn't a course on German history, and so I won't

149
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,560
go into all of what happens between 1933 and of course, 44.

150
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,800
But everything basically goes wrong in German culture.

151
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,040
One of the philosophers who actually studied under, and who's also a phenomenologist who

152
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,720
studied under Martin Heidegger is Hannah Arendt.

153
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,160
And Hannah Arendt actually was also Heidegger's lover too.

154
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,960
She was Jewish, and she was also forced to flee Germany despite being German herself.

155
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,520
But she writes a book that I encourage you to take a look at called The Origins of Totalitarianism,

156
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:33,120
which she looks at, she gives a phenomenological reading to a certain degree.

157
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,200
She has more other texts, which are more phenomenological in nature, but she looks at the question of

158
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:47,040
what it means for the Germans to have moved into this sort of racial programming, essentially.

159
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,520
So take a look at that text, it's quite interesting.

160
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Now in 1934, though, Heidegger actually resigned his rectorship, and he actually stopped taking

161
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,320
part in the Nazi Party meeting.

162
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,880
So after 34, Heidegger is not, he doesn't, he's not official, he's still an official

163
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,040
Nazi member of the party, or official member of the Nazi Party.

164
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,880
But Heidegger, his role in terms of the Nazis really diminished, and of course, this is

165
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,680
many, many years before the genocide of the Jewish people, and the genocide of others.

166
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,640
So we can't, we're not gonna associate Heidegger, at least I don't associate Heidegger with

167
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,800
the genocide, though it raises important ethical questions regarding his affiliation,

168
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,720
especially because Heidegger refused to recant his Nazi involvement, in fact, his entire

169
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
life.

170
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,440
He never regretted being Nazi, and it's hard not to be critical of Heidegger, and I think

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,840
we really should be critical in this regard.

172
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,240
Now in 1938, in the midst of World War II, or the beginnings of World War II, Husserl

173
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
dies.

174
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,560
And it's really quite tragic because Husserl was prolific writer, a prolific and important

175
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
philosopher, and he really created a whole realm of philosophy at the center of which

176
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
is Heidegger.

177
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,560
But when Husserl dies, only two professors attend his funeral.

178
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,440
He was really shunned because of his Jewish heritage, which is evil, I think, and tragic.

179
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
In 1945, Heidegger survived the war.

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,200
People weren't sure if he had survived the war, but he did survive the war.

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,000
And a series of denazification hearings begin, in which the Nazi party is disbanded in Germany.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,520
Karl Jaspers, who's an important phenomenologist actually, and a contemporary of Heidegger's.

183
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,480
At one point, Heidegger and Karl Jaspers had had a series of correspondences, but Heidegger

184
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,880
dropped them off.

185
00:14:50,880 --> 00:15:01,680
Well, Jaspers writes a report on Heidegger's involvement, detailing, you might say, Heidegger's

186
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,960
his anti-Jewish work and the sort of the negative things that Heidegger had done.

187
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,720
The University of Freiburg faculty debate Heidegger's involvement in 1945, and by 1946, Heidegger

188
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,480
actually suffers a nervous breakdown that year, but the University of Freiburg faculty

189
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,000
of the University of Freiburg ultimately decided to grant Heidegger faculty emeritus

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,640
status, which means that he's still a member of the faculty, retired, as it were.

191
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,400
But he's barred from teaching, so he's banned from teaching any more lectures.

192
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,160
And really, it's because of his involvement in the Nazi party.

193
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,120
By 1951, the ban on teaching is lifted, and Heidegger then begins to give a series of

194
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,040
lectures throughout his career, and throughout the rest of his life, he continued to give

195
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,600
a number of really important lectures that are worth reading.

196
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,320
Tragically, as I mentioned before, Heidegger, at least on my view it's tragic, Heidegger

197
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,760
refuses to recant his Nazi involvement.

198
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:07,960
In 1976, Heidegger dies, and just a couple days after Heidegger dies, Der Spiegel, which

199
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,320
is a very important publication in Germany, publishes an interview that they conducted

200
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
with Heidegger.

201
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,200
And one of the things in that interview was they asked Heidegger point blank whether or

202
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:27,680
not he regretted his involvement as a Nazi with the Nazi National Socialists.

203
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,200
And Heidegger says no, and it's shocking.

204
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,840
The question for us is, how could a philosopher who really provides us fabulous insight philosophically

205
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:45,160
into the question of being, and really pushes phenomenology into a whole new domain and

206
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,320
becomes really so critical to the rest of the 20th century and 21st century philosophy,

207
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,840
how could such a philosopher become so blind so as not to even regret his involvement with

208
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,760
really one of the darkest stains in human history, politically and especially within

209
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,760
German history.

210
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,640
So it's quite shocking there.

211
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,920
I do think, and I don't really want to spend a lot of time talking about Nazis or National

212
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,400
Socialists in this video, but it raises for us some fundamental questions regarding is

213
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,000
there a relationship between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazism.

214
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Heidegger actually claimed that there was a certain relationship regarding his conception

215
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
of historicity.

216
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,800
We're not going to go into that right now, but on the other hand, or is his philosophy

217
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,400
really separate from this.

218
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,160
I think it's important to recognize that Heidegger is not giving us Nazi philosophy.

219
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,080
I think that is a misreading of Heidegger's work, but that does raise for us ethical

220
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
questions.

221
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,280
And in the early 80s, French phenomenologists raised this question explicitly regarding

222
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:01,720
whether or not Heidegger's involvement with the Nazis, and especially Heidegger's involvement

223
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,840
regarding who's forced retirement, whether or not that's something we can forgive and

224
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,280
how we should understand that.

225
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,960
So there's something we're talking about here, and maybe at some point in these series

226
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,360
videos we'll talk about it, but you're going to see really what I want to do in these video

227
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,760
lectures is really just take a look at Heidegger's understanding of phenomenology and in his

228
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
introduction to being in time.

229
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
So let's sort of take a look at that.

230
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
We're going to focus really quite heavily on just giving a really detailed reading in

231
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,040
this video of the introduction to being in time.

232
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,400
I imagine this video is going to run long, so feel free to pause the video, take a break

233
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
as you go through.

234
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
Let me take a drink off here.

235
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,400
Now being in time, the German, of course, is Sein und Zeit, was first published in 1927

236
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,560
in the Jahrbuch für Phänomenologie und Phänomenologist Foschum, which is a journal that was actually

237
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:12,040
edited by Edmund Husserl, so being in time here is first published by Husserl, actually,

238
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
if you will.

239
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,920
Of course, the book is dedicated to Husserl, and I mentioned this previously, a key preparatory

240
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
text.

241
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,120
There is no doubt that being in time is a difficult text to read.

242
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,400
If you would like, I encourage you to take a look at Heidegger's lecture, a history of

243
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,200
the concept of time, which is now published, which really is, if you will, sort of first

244
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,080
draft of being in time, because one of the things you're going to see in being in time

245
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,560
is that Heidegger jettisons our ordinary philosophical vocabulary, and really jettisons

246
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:52,160
the language that we saw Husserl using completely in order to articulate a new and a fresh,

247
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,080
and I think a more originary conception of Phänomenology and the question of being in

248
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
particular.

249
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,760
There's a lot of other great texts that can help you, great texts and commentaries that

250
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,840
can help you understand the history of the concept of time.

251
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:16,120
My own, there's a great philosopher, contemporary philosopher, Simon Critchley, he's actually

252
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:25,120
the editor of the New York Times philosophy blog, called The Philosopher's Stone, but

253
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,320
Simon Critchley has a great text on Husserl that was published just a couple years back

254
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,400
on being in time, which really lays out, I think, a really, really fantastic explanation

255
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,360
and commentary of Heidegger, and of course, I was previously, I'm friends with Simon,

256
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,160
with Professor Critchley, and that's my reading of Husserl is very much influenced by Professor

257
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
Critchley.

258
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,400
So take a look at that, there's some great stuff in there.

259
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Now, what's the structure of being in time?

260
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,880
Well the basic structure is there's an introduction, that's what we're going to be looking at in

261
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,040
this text.

262
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,440
Part one is called the interpretation of docile in terms of temporality, and the explication

263
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,640
of time is the transcendental horizon for the question of being.

264
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,800
By the end of today's video, you'll have an understanding of what this is talking about,

265
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,440
if you've never read or read Heidegger before.

266
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,960
And then the being in time is actually structured into two different divisions, the preparatory

267
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,200
fundamental analysis of docile, I'm sorry, part one is divided into two divisions, the

268
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,620
preparatory fundamental analysis of docile, and then division two is about docile and

269
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,920
temporality in particular.

270
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,240
Part two of being in time was actually never completed, in fact, the majority of this book

271
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,720
was never completed, partially because Heidegger was forced to rush this into publication in

272
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,920
order for his career, publisher, parish.

273
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,160
You're going to see that Heidegger really structures being in time in a very similar

274
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,800
and definitely a very Germanic way, similar to Husserl who got a series of sections.

275
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,240
Heidegger organized the text as a series of paragraphs and then sections within those.

276
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,920
And this is how Zion Insights is organized.

277
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,000
So let's sort of jump in here and you'll see that before the book even starts, there's

278
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,120
a brief title page in which there's this quotation.

279
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,320
And we're going to see that, although this is a course in phenomenology, Heidegger is

280
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,880
not writing a book on phenomenology.

281
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,920
He is interested in the most important question for him, which is the question of being.

282
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,280
And of course, we know that the philosophy is concerned with lots of things, but at

283
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:41,680
the core, philosophy is concerned with what it means to exist and what it means for us

284
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,280
to understand things in existence.

285
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,560
All of this ruminates around this concept of being, and we're going to see that this

286
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,040
is the most important question for Heidegger.

287
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,600
So let me tell you, I want to read this passage from you just because this is directly from

288
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,160
the title page here, or right after the title page before he begins the introduction.

289
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,720
And it's quite beautiful, but it sort of gets to the heart at it.

290
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,560
And so let me read this to you.

291
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,080
Heidegger writes, For manifestly, you have been aware of what you mean when you use the

292
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,160
expression being.

293
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,160
We however, who used to think we understood it, have now become perplexed.

294
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,360
Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word being?

295
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,440
Not at all.

296
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,640
So is it fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of being?

297
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,560
But are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression being?

298
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Not at all.

299
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,000
So you can see here, he says that on the one hand, we don't even understand the question

300
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,960
of being, what we mean by this term being, but on the other hand, we don't even care,

301
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
right?

302
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,840
Our aim in the following treatise in Zang Un Zaitz is to work out the question of the

303
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,720
meaning of being and to do so concretely.

304
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,600
Our provisional aim is the interpretation of time as the possible horizon for any understanding

305
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,680
whatsoever of being.

306
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,920
But the reasons for making this our aim, the investigations, which such a purpose requires

307
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,880
and the path to its achievement, call for some introductory remarks.

308
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,640
So you're going to see this is the beginning of the introduction and you're going to see

309
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,480
that really Heidegger is interested in the question of what being is and he doesn't even

310
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,680
think we even understand what being means or we even know how to ask the question of

311
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
being.

312
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,680
And so really being in time is less about being and it's about what it means to ask

313
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,440
the question of the meaning of being itself.

314
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,920
So you're going to see him articulate all of this in the introduction.

315
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,000
I'm going to follow the introduction as closely as I can section by section.

316
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,280
I should emphasize that there's a lot to the introduction and there's a lot of arguments

317
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,000
that Heidegger makes that I'm not going to be talking about simply because I will run

318
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
out of time.

319
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,840
We're already 24 minutes into the video and we're only now getting to part one.

320
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,840
So I'm not going to cover everything and so I encourage you to read this carefully and

321
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,240
probably to get a commentary text to help you along as well.

322
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,360
Now the introduction begins with paragraph one which is the necessity for explicitly

323
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
restating the question of being.

324
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Now the question of being here in the German is called the Zeinsfrage and that just means

325
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,920
question of being, right, the being question and what he wants to say is number one is

326
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,720
that the question of being is a forgotten question.

327
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,240
It's not even something that philosophers are talking about.

328
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Just particularly that Edmund Husserl never really talks about this.

329
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,320
Husserl talks about ontological structures and this sort of stuff and Husserl talks about

330
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,800
existence and he talks about actuality.

331
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,240
Consider for instance how Husserl in our previous lectures here, he talks about the

332
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,960
suspension of our general positing of actuality.

333
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,760
Well, what is actuality?

334
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,200
That's not a question that Husserl asks and he doesn't think that any of the philosophers

335
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,280
are asking this.

336
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
This is a forgotten question.

337
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,440
So what exactly is the Zeinsfrage?

338
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,880
What is the question of the meaning of being, all right?

339
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,840
And Husserl starts off, I'm sorry, Heidegger starts off by saying that the question of

340
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:32,240
being is what is stimulating this ancient Greek research of Plato and Aristotle.

341
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:42,040
Here, of course, in our introduction to philosophy video series, I give a very sort of cursory

342
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,520
analysis of Plato's theory of the forms and in my history of philosophy course, we talk

343
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,000
a little bit more about Aristotle's metaphysics in more detail.

344
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,840
But we're going to see here that at the core of both Plato and Aristotle's, the question

345
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,720
of what it means to be, what it means to be and Heidegger actually would go on to give

346
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,560
very specific concrete lectures about Plato and Aristotle with regards to the question

347
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,000
of the meaning of being.

348
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,120
We're not going to really review those, but if you do, you will find that Heidegger has

349
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,200
a very, I think, unique analysis of Plato in particular.

350
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,360
He doesn't think that we understand Plato correctly.

351
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,440
Anyway, I'm not going to go into that.

352
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:29,320
But the meaning of being, the question of what it means to be is at the core of ancient

353
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
Greek philosophy.

354
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,280
But things are even worse than we realize because the original contribution of Greek

355
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,960
philosophy, Heidegger argues, has actually sanctioned the neglect of the question of

356
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
being.

357
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,120
That is, the Greek philosophy is generated out of this question of what it means to be.

358
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,960
But because we have all of these contributions from these Greek philosophers all the way

359
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:01,040
from the originary priests of cracks like Parmenides all the way up through Hegel, what we see

360
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,200
is that we've neglected the question of being.

361
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,320
Now, being on the one hand has been said as the most universal concepts, and here I encourage

362
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,760
you to take a look at the work of Thomas Aquinas, who actually focuses quite heavily

363
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,520
on the question of being, and Thomas Aquinas argues this too, is that being is on the one

364
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,080
hand the most universal concept, but it's also the most empty concept, because on the

365
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:36,360
one hand, everything that we experience and everything we see is a form of being, which

366
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,800
means that everything has been.

367
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,640
But since everything has been, we don't really know what we're talking about.

368
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,520
It's the sort of old idea that if something is everything, then in a certain way it's

369
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
nothing.

370
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,600
And that's to say that existence clearly is something, it's so universal, but because

371
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,520
of its universality, it's an empty concept.

372
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,360
In fact, it looks like being just simply resists every attempt at definition.

373
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,680
But everyone seems to use this term, and they seem to understand what being means, or as

374
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,760
Heidegger would say, there's so it would seem.

375
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,320
We don't really know what we're talking about, though we have some sort of general intuition.

376
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,400
We have some sort of provisional, obscure, average understanding, but it's insufficient

377
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,600
philosophically.

378
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,960
In section two, and by the way, in all of the video here, whenever I have a pagination,

379
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,720
I'm using the original Heideggerian pagination, and so it's page two here, Heidegger says,

380
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,800
in this way, that which the ancient philosophers found continually disturbing as something

381
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,200
obscure and hidden, has taken on a sort of clarity and self-evidence, such that if anyone

382
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,000
continues to ask about it, he's charged with an error of method.

383
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,600
So we sort of think that we know we have a handle on what existence and being means,

384
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,640
to the point that, for instance, if you ask a philosopher, they can rattle off a series

385
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,720
of arguments.

386
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
For instance, though Heidegger doesn't mention this at all, think about the ontological argument

387
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:17,640
for God's existence, and think about the use of existence and the use of being in that

388
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,720
discussion, in which it's taken as self-evident what it means for things to exist.

389
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,000
So philosophers are not really thinking about this question, especially when Heidegger is

390
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
writing.

391
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,480
Now, of course, we're going to see that phenomenology, as prepared by Edmund Husserl, provides

392
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,080
us a way in which to begin to access this question.

393
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,560
But consider the fact that all of the philosophical work that's going on really around the world

394
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:49,400
at this time, no one is asking this question, not in the way that Heidegger will ask it.

395
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,960
And Heidegger's argument here is that there's so many philosophical prejudices that we have

396
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,400
that they're really too numerous.

397
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,640
There's too many of them that we can adequately deal with at the beginning of being in time.

398
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,720
So we can't really start off and really understand what the meaning of being is, or even what

399
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,640
the question, the Zeinsfraga of being is, the question of being, because we just have

400
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,200
so many philosophical prejudices.

401
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,600
Recall when we looked at Edmund Husserl's work, Husserl talked about the idea that we

402
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,920
had to bracket off all of these theoretical concepts we become accustomed to, and we're

403
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,000
going to see that Heidegger not only agrees with Husserl, but he doesn't think we go far

404
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,480
enough because we can't really uncouple ourselves from them.

405
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
So all we really have is a clue to the question of being.

406
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,720
Now in the introduction of being in time, Heidegger begins by sort of signifying, we

407
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,880
have this clue about what the question of being is, but let's lay out what our prejudices

408
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
regarding being are.

409
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,400
The first prejudice here is the universal nature of being.

410
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,200
And that's when we say that, when, for instance, Thomas Aquinas says that being is the most

411
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,600
universal concept, well, what kind of, what does that mean here?

412
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,520
And Heidegger sees this as a prejudice, which makes it difficult, or really rather impossible,

413
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,960
for us to begin to think about what we're even talking about.

414
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,360
The first thing here is that Heidegger emphasizes that being is not a universal genus.

415
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,400
You'll recall that when we laid out the distinction between genus and species, the genus is always

416
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:31,600
a higher category that subsumes particular individual categories.

417
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,520
But the idea here is that when we say that being is universal, we don't mean that being

418
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,880
is a universal genus.

419
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,920
We're not talking about a category at all.

420
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,960
And this is the difficulty here.

421
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,320
For instance, Heidegger mentions that the medieval's refer to being, and they use the

422
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,480
term transcendus, or at least in the Latin formulation, I'm not giving you the Latin

423
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,600
here, but it transcends.

424
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,640
And of course, to transcend is to go beyond.

425
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,600
And it's important here to recognize that the being goes beyond categorization itself.

426
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,800
So being is not a categorical intuition as such.

427
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Now he also mentions that, for instance, Aristotle understood the universality of being really

428
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
as a form of analogy.

429
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:24,640
So when we say that being is universal, we're saying something analogically, because being

430
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:32,640
is here, and we have genus and species, and universality is a type of genetic category.

431
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,320
But the idea here is that, for at least from Aristotle's perspective, is that this is

432
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,280
not saying it's not a genus, this is an analogical relation here.

433
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,760
And then in this section, as Heidegger discusses the universal nature of being, he talks about

434
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,680
Plato and Aristotle, and he really goes all the way up through Hegel, and talks about

435
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:01,240
how in Hegel, being becomes an indeterminate, something that's indeterminate in an immediate

436
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
sense.

437
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,280
And of course, I'm not going to go through Hegel's logic here, which is actually quite

438
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,480
complex here.

439
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,960
And also remember that Hegel has a work in phenomenology too.

440
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Not the phenomenology that Husserl describes, but the phenomenology of spirit.

441
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,920
And so being is an important category within the phenomenology of spirit, but here it's

442
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,080
indeterminate in the medium.

443
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
What exactly does that mean?

444
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:31,160
Basically, Heidegger's contention is that we don't know, because the history of philosophy

445
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,840
is actually resulted in making being the darkest of all the concepts.

446
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,040
It's not just one genetic category among others.

447
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,080
It's something completely other than that, but the history of philosophy is essentially

448
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,960
shrouded our conception of being by making it a sort of genetic universal category.

449
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,160
Section number two, the second major prejudice here that Heidegger identifies is the indefinability

450
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,560
of being.

451
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,240
Think here about what he just mentioned about Hegel.

452
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,680
Here it's important to recognize that being is not an entity.

453
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,320
And this will become an important thing for us.

454
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,760
When we talk about the existence of something, the being of something, being in and of itself

455
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,400
is not a something at all, because every something is a something only in virtue of its having

456
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,000
being or participating in being or in some way being infused as a being.

457
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,200
But being itself is not an entity.

458
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,320
So we're not talking about a thing at all.

459
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,120
Being is on the one hand, it's not derived from some higher concepts, because if you

460
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,400
will, it's the most universal, right, but analogically.

461
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,280
But then on the second way, being is not presented through these lower concepts either, which

462
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:58,240
means that we can't uncover our concept of being by looking at conceptual relations.

463
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,440
So a taxonomy of concepts, or for instance, a logical analysis of conceptual relations

464
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,920
in terms of, will never give us insight into this problem of being, right?

465
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,440
There is no definition of being in the ontical sense.

466
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
This is a mistake here.

467
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
I apologize.

468
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,480
Let's just say ontical, and we'll talk about what that means in a moment here.

469
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,000
Heidegger will actually lay out specific definitions for these things.

470
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,640
And the idea here is that when we talk about the indefinability of being, right, indefinability

471
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,400
demands actually a thorough examination of being, because what is a philosopher to do

472
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,840
when a philosopher doesn't understand something?

473
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,440
It means that they should examine it even closer, right?

474
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,400
And we'll see that this is going to be Heidegger's insistent approach, right?

475
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,920
The third prejudice that Heidegger lays out regarding our inability to think about being

476
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,560
regards the self-evident nature of being, right?

477
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:00,600
When we talk about, in our experience about things having actuality, well, it just seems

478
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,560
that it's self-evident, right?

479
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,320
And what's important here is that the way in which we comport ourselves to being, or

480
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,680
let's put it this way, self-evident, when I look at something and say, oh, it's just

481
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,320
it exists, it's self-evident, right?

482
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,960
This actually takes us back to a way in which I'm organizing and comporting myself in consciousness

483
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
towards being, right?

484
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,160
And of course, a component here, a way in which we can talk about this is think about language.

485
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:36,360
We're constantly in our language referring to being, and here think about the copula.

486
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,240
A copula is a logical category, which is the category for being, right?

487
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,360
So for the example, the sky is blue, is, is the copula, and what is the copula?

488
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Well, the copula is a demarcation of being, right?

489
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,800
So when I say that I am holding a coffee cup, M refers to being, right?

490
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,640
I'm saying that there's, that I'm saying that the coffee cup has being in my hand.

491
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,240
Well, what does it mean to demarcate being exactly?

492
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,440
What exactly are we talking about, right?

493
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,520
Obviously, I'm talking about a comportment in consciousness, but we're going to see significantly

494
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,120
every comportment is itself a form of being, right?

495
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:24,320
So the comportment towards entities always uses the concept of being, and this presents

496
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:32,160
us with what Heidegger calls an a priori enigma, that is, enigma that comes before our experience

497
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
itself, right?

498
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,000
A mystery that needs to be addressed.

499
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,840
So self-evidence here is a dubious procedure.

500
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,840
To say that something self-evident is really a way at avoiding the question and the mystery

501
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,960
of the demarcation and the significance of being, and it's a way to dubiously ignore

502
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,560
this a priori enigma, right?

503
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,880
Not only is there no answer to the question of being here, Heidegger says, well, not that

504
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,840
there's not an answer, but not only do we not have an answer to the question of being,

505
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,200
we don't even know what the question is, right?

506
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,480
And so, for instance, is if as I'm talking through this video lecture, you're thinking,

507
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
what is he talking about?

508
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,000
What does it mean to ask the question of what existence of being means?

509
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,520
You don't know because we don't even have a grasp on the question of being here itself.

510
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,360
And you're going to see this is in the introduction of being time, because being in time is meant

511
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:34,400
to give us really a path towards eventually being able to just understand what the question

512
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,600
of being is, just to get us to the point where we can understand what the Zeinsfraga is all

513
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
about.

514
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,360
Now, paragraph two of the introduction concerns the formal structure of the question of being,

515
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,360
right?

516
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,520
So, on the one hand, we don't know the content of the question of being.

517
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,400
We don't really know what we're asking, but we can recognize that to ask a question, every

518
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
question has a structure, right?

519
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
Because every question is something that always asks for an answer, right?

520
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,640
So, what is the, can we formulate this question, and then we can ask what belongs to the form

521
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,160
of any question?

522
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,840
Well, Heidegger says, right, is that every inquiry, because a question is to inquire,

523
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
right?

524
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,160
Every inquiry is a seeking, a sukin, right?

525
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,720
Every inquiry is a seeking, and every seeking is always guided by what is sought, right?

526
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,680
So imagine if I'm looking for my keys, right?

527
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,680
I'm seeking my keys throughout the room, looking, and what is guiding my seeking is what I'm

528
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,120
looking for, right?

529
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:41,560
So that means that the question of being, whatever it is, right, it's a seeking after

530
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,880
being, and it has to be guided by being itself, right?

531
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,880
So seeking for what being is, and that means we have to seek in regard to the manner of

532
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
being.

533
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,840
So, we can start to, as it were, so Heidegger's argument here isn't that the Zionsfrog is

534
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,520
an impossible question.

535
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,680
It's rather that we have to work our way out of our categories, and we can start by formally

536
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,160
understanding that the answer and the question of being itself ultimately has to be guided

537
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,600
by being, right?

538
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:18,360
So the form of a question always includes A, that which is interrogated.

539
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,120
This is what Heidegger does not use this term, and I think he would object to my using this

540
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,120
term.

541
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:30,000
What you might say is that the question always, right, moves towards, is looking for a specific

542
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,200
object, right?

543
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,840
It's guided, and it includes that which is interrogated, but it also includes that which

544
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,760
is found out, and here I want to talk about the essence here.

545
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,080
The reason I've included the object and essence here is because I want you to see that there

546
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:49,040
is a linkage between the Husserlian categories of phenomenology and ideas one in what Husserl

547
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,760
Heidegger is doing here.

548
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,880
Heidegger, for reasons we'll get to in a moment, specifically does not want to use this sort

549
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,160
of language, but it is, I think, helpful for us to, and for at least in this course, I

550
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,320
want you to see the lineage of what Heidegger is doing traces back to Husserl, right?

551
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,040
Now, inquiry to inquire itself is a particular manner of being for a being that inquires,

552
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
right?

553
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,360
So remember here is that since, so to just ask any question to inquire itself, only

554
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:27,240
beings which can inquire can ask questions, right?

555
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:34,200
And that means that as a being that can inquire, when I make an inquiry, I'm actually taking

556
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,160
on a particular manner of being, right?

557
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,240
I'm existing in a certain sort of way, right?

558
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,560
Here you can think about maybe Husserl's categories of noesis, it's a type of noema,

559
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,880
for instance, inquiry, right?

560
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:53,360
Now, Husserl is not, Heidegger is not going to follow Husserl along those lines, right?

561
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:00,360
And in a certain way, you can see here, there's a sort of tragedy regarding Husserl's view

562
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,160
of what phenology was to become, because in a certain way, it gets dismantled to some

563
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,520
degree by Heidegger, right?

564
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,760
But back to the point, inquiry itself is a particular manner of being for a being that

565
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
inquires.

566
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,200
Oops, let's go back there, right?

567
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,440
Now since we have some access to the concept of being, because we do have the copula, we

568
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,800
do use these concepts, that means that there must be a way to inquire about it.

569
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,400
You can see this is what Heidegger would call our average every day, of vague, I don't know

570
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
what it's right here.

571
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,840
This is what we call a vague average understanding, or an average every day understanding of being.

572
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,000
So what is being?

573
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,040
Well, Heidegger says, what we need to do is we need to know what the horizon for that

574
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,360
very question is, right?

575
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,400
And by horizon here, think about the language that Husserl used here to talk about, you

576
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,600
know, the conditions for the possibility of the question, right?

577
00:43:54,600 --> 00:44:00,360
What we do know, for instance, about being is that being determines the entities as entities.

578
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,520
So anything can be an entity, everything from the coffee shop to the mirror behind me, to

579
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,680
me, right?

580
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:13,440
All of this is being, and we know that being is what determines an entity as an entity.

581
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,400
So you can't be an entity if you don't have being, right?

582
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,080
But being, like we said earlier, is not an entity in itself, right?

583
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
So what does this mean?

584
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:29,200
Well, it means that the Zeinsfraga is not a question, to address the Zeinsfraga, it's

585
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,160
not a question of trying to tell a story or trace an origin.

586
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,160
Why?

587
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,680
Because only entities have origins, right?

588
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,520
So we're not going to be trying to link it back to some sort of start with an entity

589
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,800
and work our way backwards to the question of being.

590
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,640
In a certain way, this is a way in which you might, for instance, understand the defunct

591
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,280
nature of the problems regarding first movers and all of this sort of stuff that you may

592
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,560
have heard of, or you can take a look at regarding, for instance, Thomas Aquinas' or Aristotle

593
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
here, right?

594
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:10,480
In which there's a sort of tracing towards origin.

595
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,640
Heinegger as explicit as we can't do that here, right?

596
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,240
On six, he says, hence being, as that which is asked about, must be exhibited in a way

597
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,840
of its own, and this is essentially different from the way in which entities themselves

598
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,280
are discovered, right?

599
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,560
So that means we need to find a way to understand being that is, that remains faithful or has

600
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,920
a fidelity towards being itself, right?

601
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,680
So that's why we can't tell a story because you can only tell stories of entities and

602
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,080
we have to be faithful to being as itself.

603
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,080
Now what are the different ways in which we recognize being?

604
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,920
Well, everything we talk about, right?

605
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,800
Everything we have in view, all of the things we comport ourselves towards, right?

606
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,840
We're being, how we are is being, right?

607
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,120
The inquiry itself is a manner of being.

608
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,920
When we talk about something having reality, we're talking about being, right?

609
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,360
And think here about, I can talk about the reality of that which is outside of me, but

610
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,440
I can also talk about the reality of the presentations I have in consciousness, for instance.

611
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,200
All of those are real, all of those have being, right?

612
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,040
That something is, and we're talking about reality, what is present hand, right, before

613
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
me?

614
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,240
What subsistence means?

615
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,880
Even validity is a way in which we recognize being.

616
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,520
And think here, if you want, take a look at my series on Introduction to Formal Logic,

617
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,000
and we talk about the validity of argumentative propositions, right?

618
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,320
Or for instance, quantificational validity.

619
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,240
To say that something is valid is to demarcate a form of being, right?

620
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,000
It's to say that something is, right?

621
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,400
So when we talk about there being something is, or we're talking about something given,

622
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,520
we're always recognizing being.

623
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,800
So whatever point of departure we're going to make towards being, we have to recognize

624
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,360
that these different manners, right?

625
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,880
So from which of the entities is the disclosure of being taken?

626
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
What has the priority?

627
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,600
Well, Heidegger says to understand being, we have to understand how we look at being.

628
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:25,840
In other words, we need to uncover the nature of the being that we ourselves are, right?

629
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:32,600
Because since being is something that's recognized by us, and that recognition is a form of being,

630
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:39,040
we can't understand what being is in itself, we have to first begin and uncover what being

631
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,720
means for the being, for whom being is a question, right?

632
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,560
We're going to see this as an explicit reference to an important concept of Heidegger's, okay?

633
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:54,960
Now this, and this is the concept, Dasein, right?

634
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Heidegger writes on seven, this entity, which each of us is, is himself, and which includes

635
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,280
inquiring as one of the possibilities being, we're going to denote by the term Dasein.

636
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,040
Now in German, Dasein, you can see here, Zein is the term for being, and Da means to point,

637
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,040
right?

638
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,120
So here it means something like to point to being, and what he means to say is that we're

639
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,360
going to call ourselves Dasein.

640
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,280
Now later on, in just a minute, Heidegger's going to really say, and this is what I want

641
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,360
you to memorize here, is that whenever you say what is being, what is Dasein, Dasein

642
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,440
is the being, for whom being is an issue.

643
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,360
Now that means that all human beings who can ask the question of being, and who can recognize

644
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,440
being are Dasein.

645
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,920
So he's talking about us, Dasein is his term for the human.

646
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,240
Now he doesn't use the term human here, because by using the term Dasein, he's signifying

647
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,800
the, the being of the person who inquires after being, right?

648
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,200
So he's giving this new term, this new language.

649
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,920
In many ways, you're going to see that being in time operates almost lexinographically,

650
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,880
and it operates as a lexicon of concepts for thinking about how, what being is, and what

651
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,880
it means for us.

652
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,360
Now, Heidegger recognizes there might be a problem here, that is, is there a circularity?

653
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,040
Because are we really just saying we're going to understand being by understanding being,

654
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,040
right?

655
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,280
And, and Heidegger's response here is, well, that factically, there is no circle at all,

656
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
right?

657
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,040
Because when we look at the actuality of ourselves, the facticity of ourselves, and we'll see

658
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,720
later in the book, Heidegger will explicitly define facticity, though I'm not going to

659
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,760
do it now, is when we look to how we actually exist, we recognize that we can determine

660
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,200
the nature of an entity's being without first formulating the meaning of being itself, right?

661
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,640
That is, it's not circularity, but it's a relatedness between the backwards and the

662
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,240
forwardness of our inquiring nature of being as beings.

663
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,040
This stuff is difficult, I know.

664
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,680
So I hope this is helping, and I hope this, this is at least laying clear some of these

665
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,680
concepts.

666
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,760
Now, paragraph three is known as the ontological priority of the question of being.

667
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,440
Now, what he's going to argue here, and you'll see the ontology is going to play an important

668
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,480
role here, and we'll get to this in a minute.

669
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:22,600
Now, when we talk about this question of being, we can ask, is the Zeinsfrager the question

670
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,440
of being a matter of speculation, or is it a matter of the most basic and concrete of

671
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,320
all possible questions?

672
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:34,720
Of course, he doesn't think it's just speculation, he actually thinks it is a concrete question.

673
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,480
The problem is, it's a concrete question, but it's so concrete and so basic, and then

674
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:46,480
coupled on top of it with the history of our theoretical concepts and philosophy, we just

675
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,680
don't know what that concretizing thing is, right?

676
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,720
So the task here is to understand the constitution of entities, because every entity has being,

677
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:05,240
so the constitution of any entity ultimately must trace back to being, or as it were, right?

678
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:09,000
So the task is to understand the constitution of entities in their most basic sense, and

679
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,680
this is what a science is doing ultimately, right?

680
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,560
And Heidegger here actually discusses the role of the sciences.

681
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,720
He talks about the crisis of science in his day, or in I think would still be today, and

682
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,080
he mentions, for instance, the crisis in mathematics, we can talk about formalism and intuitionism,

683
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,120
but he goes on to talk about mathematics, physics, biology, the historical human sciences,

684
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,800
theology, and so forth.

685
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,120
All of these have a crisis, and what's the crisis?

686
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:42,760
The crisis refers to the idea that none of these sciences are able to articulate what

687
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,080
it means to evaluate the things themselves, right?

688
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:51,280
So for instance, mathematics is looking at mathematical concepts that have validity,

689
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
right?

690
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,280
That's a type of being, but what exactly is that mathematics can't tell us?

691
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,120
The same things with physics and center, right?

692
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,760
He has a quotation here on 10, quote, basic concepts determine the way in which we get

693
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,840
an understanding beforehand of the area of subject matter, underline all the objects

694
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:15,480
the science takes as its themes, and all the positive investigation is guided by this

695
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,480
understanding.

696
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,760
Only after this area itself has been explored beforehand in a corresponding manner do these

697
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,840
concepts become genuinely demonstrated as grounded.

698
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,160
So you can see here is that what he's going to say is that the sciences today are in crisis

699
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,960
because they have no grounding in their understanding of the copula, right, of being, of continuing

700
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
on.

701
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,720
And in every such area, every science is itself obtained from the domain of entities themselves.

702
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:49,400
This preliminary research from which the basic concepts are drawn signifies nothing else

703
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,960
than an interpretation of those entities with regard to their basic state of being.

704
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,440
Such research must run ahead of the positive sciences as Andy can.

705
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,520
Here the work of Plato and Aristotle's evidence enough, right?

706
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:07,520
You can see that Plato and Aristotle without any science, any conception of modern science

707
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,640
or any of the work that was laid out by the later scientists, right, they're able to begin

708
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,640
to address this.

709
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,760
So we can, in fact, begin to try to understand the grounding of the sciences by looking at

710
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,320
being other philosophers have done so, and we too can do it, right?

711
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,200
And this would hold for theology as well.

712
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:33,120
Now the crisis of the sciences require an examination of what it means for something

713
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,400
to be as they're given.

714
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,200
Now this is the discussion of ontology, right?

715
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,960
And in a really general sense, what you can say is that ontology is the, is, refers to

716
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,960
the logic of being, right, ontos being in Greek there, right?

717
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,440
And so what you might say is that ontology refers to the relations that beings have with

718
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,880
each other and with themselves.

719
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,600
Now Heidegger is doing a fundamental ontology at the, or he wants to get to a fundamental

720
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,120
ontology with designs froga.

721
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,960
Now Heidegger makes a distinction here between ontology versus what he calls the ontical,

722
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,480
or the ontic, right?

723
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,520
And this is sometimes referred to as the ontological distinction, right?

724
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:22,280
The ontology refers concerns being itself, whereas the ontical concerns entity, the being

725
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,520
of entities themselves, right?

726
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:29,760
So if we're talking about ontology in its most radical sense, we're talking about being

727
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
in and of itself.

728
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:36,960
If we're talking about ontics, we're talking about the being of specific sorts of entities.

729
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,320
So for instance, you can say that if we go back to Edmund Hustrel's discussion of consciousness,

730
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,040
all of that was ontical.

731
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,480
It wasn't ontology proper, right?

732
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:57,400
And the same thing would go for any number of philosophers we could name, right?

733
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:03,800
All ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at

734
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:10,000
its disposal, remains blind and is perverted from its own most aim.

735
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,840
If it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of being and conceived this clarification

736
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,040
as its fundamental task, right?

737
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:24,920
So all of the things that the ontologies we've seen previously were actually ontical because

738
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,440
the ontology itself, being itself, the meaning of being, is never answered or clarified.

739
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:38,440
OK, so now we're going to move to the paragraph four, where Heidegger discusses the

740
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,440
ontical priority of the question of being, right?

741
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,120
Now, science in general refers to the totality of established interconnections of true

742
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,160
propositions within a specific domain, right?

743
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
So that's what science is.

744
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,240
And you're going to see that the Heidegger is giving a science here, but he's giving

745
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,280
an originary conception of what a science means.

746
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:07,640
A science in general is this totality of established interconnections of true propositions.

747
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,640
The question of establishment here ultimately goes back to the type of science we're looking at,

748
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,160
right?

749
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,520
So how a chemist establishes true propositions in their interconnections differs from how

750
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,120
a mathematician does, right?

751
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,280
But they're both doing the same thing in a general level, as it were, right?

752
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,600
But the science of beings, but what about the science?

753
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:36,280
But science has the has the being of its entities, and that is every science ultimately also

754
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:46,440
includes the manner of being of which is the of which is the occurrence of the

755
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,280
inquire or the sciences themselves.

756
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:57,200
In other words, that the science has an ontical theme, which is determined by the

757
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,040
scientist, because the scientist is the person who's doing the inquiring.

758
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,760
So remember, we talked about inquiring as a manner of being.

759
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,960
Well, that filters into science, which means that the science has the being of its

760
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,720
entities that has its being of us or Dawson.

761
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:19,120
So what distinguishes Dawson ontically is that that is that being is an issue for it, right?

762
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,880
Or being in such a way that one has an understanding of being, right?

763
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,840
Now, the kind of being that Dawson can comport itself towards is designated by the term

764
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,440
existence.

765
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:37,840
So when I comport myself towards the coffee cup here, right, that comportment is designated

766
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,240
by existence, right?

767
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,520
That's what I mean by existence, right?

768
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,080
And think here about when if I don't know something exists, I don't know it exists

769
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,280
because I can't comport myself towards it, at least in a sort of kind of concrete

770
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:51,840
fashion.

771
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,600
Heidegger writes Dawson always understands itself in terms of its existence, in terms

772
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,040
of a possibility of itself to be itself or not itself.

773
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,040
Here, of course, I think of Shakespeare to be or not to be Dawson has either chosen

774
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,800
these possibilities itself or got itself into them or grown up in them already, right?

775
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,600
So, so how exactly Dawson gets in this, we're not sure, but there's these different ways.

776
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,080
Only the particular Dawson decides its existence, whether it does so by taking

777
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:30,520
hold or by neglecting the question of existence never gets straightened out, except

778
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,600
through existing itself.

779
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,520
And here's quite fascinating, right?

780
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:42,240
This is the idea here is that one cannot recognize existence, except through a manner

781
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,200
of existing, right?

782
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,360
You can see here, it's a similar sort of question to this problem of being.

783
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:53,960
Now, Heidegger is now going to start to give us a range of categories and lay out what

784
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,920
these categories are.

785
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,920
The understanding of oneself by existence is called what he calls the existential,

786
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,760
existential, right?

787
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,480
Let's see, let's move here.

788
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,440
And here's a list of categories, right?

789
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,120
So existence here refers to that which Dawson comports itself towards, right?

790
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,760
The existential is the understanding of itself by Dawson.

791
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:24,280
Existentiality refers to the structures of existence and existential refers to the

792
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,040
analytic of existentiality, right?

793
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,680
That refers to the analytic of the structures of existence and the understanding

794
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,800
of itself by Dawson is existential, right?

795
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:41,120
So he's sort of laying out these terms, which can be confusing, but I hope you'll see

796
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,880
there's a rigorous formulation to what he's doing here.

797
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:49,240
At the end of the day, what we can say is that being in the world is something that

798
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,760
belongs to Dawson existentially, right?

799
00:59:52,800 --> 01:00:00,360
That is the analytic of the structure of existence for Dawson is that Dawson is a

800
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,960
being in the world.

801
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,080
All of us are always already thrown into the world as it were, right?

802
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,080
We're living in a world and we can't separate ourselves from that.

803
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,160
And so if we want to understand Dawson's existential, right?

804
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,920
Then we have to recognize that Dawson is a being in the world.

805
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:26,440
And we're going to see later on in subsequent videos that this will this this

806
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,400
insight of our being in the world as a preliminary structural category for

807
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:38,960
Dawson is going to allow Heidegger to lay out structurally his formal analysis of

808
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,640
Dawson, okay?

809
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:45,440
So on 13 he says, therefore fundamental ontology, right?

810
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,080
Remember the ontological distinction from which alone all other ontologies can take

811
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:55,080
their rise must be sought in the existential analytic of Dawson, right?

812
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:01,320
That has to be sought out in the way in which we are beings in the world.

813
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,320
The way in which we have, we're a manner of being towards things that exist, right?

814
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,840
Now that means that Dawson takes priority here in terms of articulating the meaning

815
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,080
of the question of being, right?

816
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,720
And so Heidegger lays out, he says, really when we talk about this priority,

817
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,600
there's three things that go along.

818
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,600
On the one hand, there's the ontical priority where Dawson is an entity whose

819
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,520
being has the determinant character of existence, right?

820
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:32,240
So Dawson is something that existing, but there's the ontological priority in

821
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,440
which Dawson is in itself ontological because existence is that's

822
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,840
determinative for it.

823
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,200
Remember Dawson is the being for whom being is an issue.

824
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,920
And then there's the ontico ontological priority in which Dawson also possesses as

825
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,240
constitutive for its understanding of existence, an understanding of the being

826
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,080
of all entities of a character other than its own, right?

827
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,480
So there's these sorts of three categories that Heidegger is going to use within the text.

828
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,840
Now, let me give you here this great quote from Heidegger here, which is quote,

829
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,720
if to interpret the meaning of being becomes our task, Dawson is not only the

830
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,760
primary entity to be interrogated, it is also the entity which already comports

831
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,680
itself and it's being towards what we're asking about when we ask this question.

832
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,840
So let's get moving here.

833
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,280
Okay.

834
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,280
Now, now this is section two of the introduction and I've already gone an hour.

835
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,680
So here's what I'm going to do as I'm going to stop right now.

836
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:42,320
And in the next video, I will complete our understanding are, I will complete the

837
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,480
video on the second part of the introduction of being in time.

838
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,720
Thanks again for watching.

839
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,080
I look forward to seeing you guys online.
