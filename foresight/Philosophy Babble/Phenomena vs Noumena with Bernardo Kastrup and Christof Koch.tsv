0	5600	Welcome back to the Great Minds series. This evening we are diving into the fascinating
5600	12400	world of consciousness with two incredible guests. First up we have Professor Christoph Koch,
12400	17840	Divisionary Chief Scientist and President at the Allen Institute of Brain Science.
17840	22480	Christoph has been at the forefront of neuroscience, shaping our understanding of
22480	28880	consciousness with his work on the Neural Basis and Development of Integrated Information Theory,
28880	36480	or IIT. Joining him is Bernardo Castro, a dynamic philosopher and computer scientist who is
36480	42720	shaking up the philosophy of mind with his passionate advocacy for analytic idealism.
42720	49920	Bernardo challenges us to rethink everything we think we knew about a reality and consciousness.
49920	55360	Together we are going to explore the intersections of neuroscience, physics and philosophy,
55360	60640	and maybe just maybe we all will leave with a deeper understanding of our own mind.
60640	67120	So welcome Professor Koch, welcome Bernardo. Let's dive in and get this conversation started.
67120	74400	So Christoph, I'm curious about the recent shift in your perspective on consciousness.
75360	81360	You have long champion, you know, integrated information theory, which places
82240	88560	consciousness within a strictly physicalist framework. Yet it seems that, you know,
89440	95120	that a personal experience has recently shifted you towards embracing Bernardo's
96000	102480	analytic idealism. So would you consider this as a turning point in your ontological view?
103040	108000	Thank you. Thank you, Ivy. Well, I mean, first of all, let's just take a step back. So we're talking
108000	114880	about consciousness experience. IIT takes a position that what exists first, primary,
114880	120720	for itself, absolute existence is consciousness. So that is not a classical physicalist position.
120720	127760	When you see IIT is firmly within the physicalist framework, that's not really true. It's closer to,
127760	133520	I would say, lightness. You know, first and foremost, what exists is my own, is my consciousness,
133520	138480	the only thing I know about. I don't know about atoms and black holes and viruses and all of that,
138480	143040	I have to infer. I don't know about dogs and all of that. All of that I have to infer based on
144240	151840	my observations and inference and scientific methods. And so IIT starts with consciousness and
151840	159280	then tries to characterize what is consciousness and what is the substrate of consciousness,
159280	167600	like a brain or computer. That is very different from the majority of theories, almost all theories
167600	173600	in neuroscience, that do start with a brain. So they say, well, let's look at the brain and what's
173600	180480	critical for consciousness. And I used to be like that when almost a more than a third of a century
180480	187200	ago, I started work with Francis Crick, the molecular biologist who turned into consciousness
187200	192000	researcher. And we said, well, there might be these oscillations, you know, that neurons fire
192000	198880	periodically with a period of 50 times or 40 times a second. So this was called 40 hertz oscillation.
199520	205200	And even if that would be true, it's like, you have to say, well, why 40 hertz? Why not 30 hertz?
205200	211040	Why not 50 hertz? Some people say consciousness has to do with broadcasting of information in a
211040	215840	global workspace in the brain. Well, then you have to explain why is it that broadcast and there's
215840	222880	any broadcast responsible. So all these theories try to take the brain and try to squeeze the brain
222880	227680	by saying, well, it's this function of that neuron or this area or that neurotransmitter.
227680	234320	So they try to squeeze the sort of the mixing metaphysics here, the wine of consciousness
234320	239760	out of the brain. And that, as David Chalmers pointed out, is a very hard problem. So IIT
240080	247360	starts differently. It says what first mode exists. The only thing I'm sure of that exists is
247360	252160	consciousness. Not when I'm in deep sleep, because then I don't exist for myself. I'm gone.
252160	258560	Not an anesthesia, because then also I don't exist for myself. So it's important to make this
258560	265440	clear. IIT is not physicalist. It makes prediction about the substrate. It makes some very sense.
265440	270080	The substrate in the brain for consciousness has to be a maximum of cause effect power. You can
270080	275760	compute that actually. It's very explicit. If you know a mechanism, if you can describe the
275760	281840	mechanism like the brain or any other mechanism using it mathematically, it's called its transition
281840	288160	probability matrix, then you can unfold its causal power to see whether it's conscious and what it
288160	294240	is conscious of and how conscious it is using this number called phi, which is the number between
294240	301920	zero when it's not conscious and something positive. But it also says the physical stuff is
301920	308880	subvenient in a sense it has a lesser existence. My brain exists for others. My body exists for
308880	314240	others, but consciousness exists for itself. So that's the difference between absolute existence
314240	322800	of mind and derivative secondary, if you want, relative existence of stuff like atoms and brains
322880	325280	and cars and shoes and ceiling works for others.
328960	331840	So you don't think that it's a physicalist model then?
332720	339920	No, it's not. In fact, we were attacked last year as pseudoscience. There was this big Twitter
339920	345680	storm in Letters Britain to Nature and other journals because people said, well, it doesn't
345680	350720	take this physicalist position. It starts out with consciousness and we can't describe that.
351440	357680	You have to start with something concrete like the brain. No, we want, of course, the project
357680	362000	is to identify what other neural footprints in the brain, which bits and pieces of the brain are
362000	370160	involved in generating anyone, in constituting anyone conscious experience, but ultimately what
370160	379040	exists is consciousness. Now, it's not a classical idealist position because unlike
379040	385920	analytic idealism, it does assume that there is some sort of substrate, some sort of
385920	392160	undifferentiated substrate out there that could, you know, made out of atoms and elementary particles
392160	400880	and maybe, you know, quarks or whatnot, just some stuff. But we humans impose everything else
400880	406640	that we see. When I look at this room here, I see refrigerator, I see oars on the wall, I see wood,
406640	412880	I can look out, I can see the sun. All of those are products of my conscious mind because there
412880	419760	are no oars in a universe devoid of the mental. There is no refrigerator, there isn't even a sun.
419760	425760	All there is is undifferentiated stuff, very simple physical stuff that can that can take
425760	431440	different states. But but everything else is a construct of our minds. It's a construct of
431440	439600	consciousness. Thank you. So what is the implication then when you have these changes? You went to see
439600	446400	Bernardo two months ago to speak about these changes in your model. So you spoke about the crack. So
446400	452000	what is the implications of the crack then we want to know? Well, so I guess again, we have to step
452000	459280	a little bit backward here for the audience. So yeah, last year, I had a mystical experience
461760	470960	sitting on a beach at midnight under the midnight moon in which myself was gone. There was no more
471040	476960	self, there was no more Christoph, there was no body, there was no surround, there was all gone,
476960	487760	there was no world. What I asked, what I accessed, what I experienced, it's very difficult, you know,
487760	493520	it's sort of called ineffable for a reason. It felt closest, if you remember, if you've ever
493600	501120	read Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, when he talks of a mind at large, you know,
501120	508400	when he had this mescaline experience in Los Angeles in 1948, he he he experienced what he
508400	515200	called mind at large. And that was my that was my experience, I experienced that that's something,
516000	521040	well, there wasn't an eye when I say eye, I meant whatever remained of my conscious entity,
521040	526160	because there wasn't a me explain something, there was no more border or distinction between
526160	532080	object, subject, apprehender, apprehended, no annoying. But, you know, I used the shorthand
532080	539440	for items to describe this mind, this conscious mind, apprehended, it felt like it apprehended
539440	545600	something universal, cosmic, all-encompassing. And that really left me, I mean, that night
545600	552240	completely perturbed, I was completely perturbed by this, and it's really left sort of like,
552960	560160	like an earthquake, where you feel, you know, at my age, you know, I'm 67 now, at my age,
560160	565600	typically your ontology is pretty well firmly established by now, right? You know, you believe
565600	572080	what you believe in whatever world you believe, so it's uncommon for this to be to have this,
572720	577440	just like in an earthquake, where suddenly you realize that the ground you stand on isn't what
577440	585520	it seemed to have been for the last 50 years of my life. So, I'm still processing, I'm still working
585520	593200	through that and how that's, how I can reconcile that with what I know about consciousness and
593200	598640	what it means for me and this project, my life-flagging project is to identify the
598720	604320	footprints of consciousness in the brain and to build tools to test for the presence of consciousness.
605360	608480	And that's probably, and maybe here Bernardo can say something,
609040	615520	even on idealism, I think that project remains intact, because what I've realized over the
615520	622480	last several years, that physicalism is not science. I mean, physicalism is used to justify
622480	628720	science, but you can still do all the science you do without necessarily being a physicalist,
628720	634720	right? You can assume, accept as an external world, it has caused us that I can study,
634720	639840	I can manipulate them, they're lawful, they're lawful regularities, right? I can discover them
639840	647360	and then I can exploit them for technological, you know, using technology for societal benefit.
647360	656480	So, all of that remains intact while you may just give up this belief that ultimately what truly
656480	663120	exists is a physical. And there are two more reasons I began to doubt physicalism, pure
663120	669280	physicalism over the last five or six years. One is that physicalism is utterly failed to
669280	675120	explain consciousness. Typically, what it does as a late, you know, Dan Dennett, the American,
675120	681040	the Dorian of American philosophers who passed away 10 days ago, essentially argued using very
681040	686560	fancy words and languages that consciousness is an illusion. It doesn't exist. You can totally
686560	691680	eliminate it from public discourse and nothing would be changed, because there isn't anything,
691680	696320	you know, there isn't anything particular, special, it's not like a substance or spirit or
696320	701200	anything like that. It's a complete illusion. If you think you're in pain, pain is all about
701280	705360	the behavior disposition, the, you know, if you have toothpaste, well, you know, you rub your
705360	711120	jaw, you don't eat on that side of your mouth, you moan about it, but there really isn't anything,
712240	717360	you know, about qualia. He famously said in this interview qual, in, within New York Times,
717360	722800	qualia humbug. That's all nonsense, okay? However, I've written to him about it. If you
722800	728880	actually have toothpaste, you know, this God awful toothache, nothing will be taken away
728880	733200	by telling me, well, it's just an illusion. It's still as bad as ever. And I still see the world
733200	738160	and I still hear the world. And if it's an illusion, it's the most profound illusion that we have all
738160	743120	the time as long as we are conscious. When we are unconscious, we don't have this illusion anymore.
743120	747840	So I think calling an illusion is just a complete failure. It's a complete cop out. It's trying to
747840	753040	cancel consciousness. And I think what's now clear that that attempt to cancel consciousness using
753120	758400	sort of classical physicalism, physicalism has failed, okay? B, at the rock bottom,
758400	763440	it's really difficult to describe what the physical is, right? It used to be easy,
763440	768000	you know, when it was still last century or the century before it was called materialism,
768000	771920	okay, it's atoms. And we all know what atoms are. They're these little billiard balls and you could
771920	777040	shoot at them and they're positive negative charges. But now it's getting much more complicated,
777040	781280	right? We still don't have a final theory of consciousness. And then we have all the paradoxes
781280	786480	of quantum mechanics that you can have a so-called bell state where you have, you know, two, let's
786480	790960	say two photons that have opted spin or two particles was opted spin, they can be a light
790960	796080	year away. They can be trillions of kilometers away, but they're still mysteriously entangled.
796080	801520	Such as if I look at one, immediately, the one, the other one that the other end of the universe,
801520	806320	you know, is, you know, flips the opposite, you know, determines its state is the opposite.
806320	812640	Well, that's not physical. I mean, that sort of really defies any idea of what physical is.
812640	818560	So we don't know how to define really fundamentally the physical. We don't know
819840	825760	how to deal with consciousness. And then I experienced something where I felt this was some
825760	831280	sort of universal mental entity. And so here we are.
832160	841760	Thank you. So, Bernardo, you think that IIT could complement your analytic idealism?
841760	845920	So could you elaborate on that? Because we have a lot of guests want to know how
845920	850080	do you going to combine these two? Yeah, can I just make a couple of initial
850080	855760	observations? Because these are things I feel passionately about. One is the same mistake you
855760	862960	made interpreting IIT as eminently physicalist I made years ago in a paragraph in your writing.
862960	868080	I already apologized to Julio Christoff and everybody else for that, corrected that in print.
869360	874240	So I understand your mistake and your mistake comes from the fact that there are physicalists
874240	882480	who use IIT to justify their views in a kind of emergent framework. That doesn't mean that IIT
882640	887760	itself or the people working hard to develop it binds themselves to the limitations of
887760	895680	physicalism which they don't. Another thing that it's not the first time I hear after the video of
896640	902800	the discussion between me and Christoff was published is that somehow Christoff changed
902800	909040	his mind completely. Well, I didn't witness that. What I witnessed is a scientist has a
909040	917760	netifice of work built behind him but he continues to explore. He continues to advance his understanding,
917760	923280	to investigate more questions and to allow his understanding to evolve. This is eminently scientific.
923280	929840	He's not flipping, he's not turning, he's not abandoning anything. At least I didn't see that.
929840	936880	Christoff can answer this question. That's not what I witnessed. And so these two misunderstandings
936880	946080	are going around and I think we should colorify these. Regarding IIT, Christoff explained that IIT
947680	954880	starts from experience. It doesn't necessarily say that experience is the ontological primitive.
954880	960960	These are metaphysical inferences and hypotheses. But IIT takes experience seriously as something
960960	966240	that really exists and is not merely an illusion or some kind of epiphenomenon. It's a starting
966240	973840	point and there is a substrate. Is that contradictory with idealism? No, in analytic idealism you have
973840	980000	both things. You have experience and you have a substrate. What idealism does as a philosophy,
980000	986240	not a scientific theory, is to interpret what these things are in terms of their being.
986960	992720	What is the substrate? An idealist would say the substrate is appearance and experience is the
992720	998160	thing in itself. Experience is nominal, the substrate is phenomenal. One is the map, the
998160	1003760	other is the territory. But this is metaphysics. These are metaphysical inferences which IIT
1003760	1009600	doesn't need to make because IIT is a scientific theory and it starts from what's available to
1009600	1016000	observation. If you observe you see that there is a substrate whose states and dynamics correlate
1016000	1022560	with the qualities of experience. This is a given. We observe this all the time and that's what we
1022560	1032640	have to work with. In general, I don't think IIT is contradictory with idealism at all. I think
1032640	1040400	they are complementary. I tell you why more specifically. I think IIT is the first scientific
1040400	1048720	theory that gives philosophy the avenue of investigation to eventually create a theory
1048720	1054960	of the nominal because all scientific theories are theories of phenomena, things that we observe.
1054960	1060880	We don't have any theory of the things in themselves. IIT in the way it models how
1061520	1068800	experiential states come together to form a sort of indivisible whole with certain experiential
1070160	1076640	properties, so to say. That is the closest thing I think we have had in the history of human knowledge
1076640	1083360	to something that one day could lead to a theory of the nominal. This is probably the most promising
1083360	1092400	thing in science today and I don't say this lightly. IIT can, in a very natural way,
1093200	1098080	offer an account of dissociation. We know dissociation happens because we know it empirically,
1098080	1102000	but we don't have any model of dissociation. We don't know exactly. Can you explain what you
1102000	1110320	mean by that? Dissociation is when you have, in the IIT terminology, you have two disjoint
1110320	1115920	complexes. There is one thing that is like to be one mental complex and there is something else
1115920	1124560	that is like to be another mental complex. They are not together. There are two centers of awareness,
1124640	1132640	so to say, like two minds within that substrate. We know this happens to people. People can
1132640	1138960	become dissociated. They can seem to be multiple different subjects. This is
1139920	1145520	vastly documented in the annals of psychiatry and since the turn of the century with the
1145520	1151760	advent of neuroimaging, we know that this is real. This is not something that people confabulate or
1151840	1159280	invent to get attention and sympathy. We know it happens, but we don't know how it happens,
1159280	1165520	what are the dynamics precisely, how it is triggered, why this illusion of
1166080	1174560	separateness within one and the same mind arises. IIT, because of its starting principles and its
1174560	1183280	information theoretical tooling, offers perhaps the only but certainly the best opportunity to
1183280	1188160	come up with a conceptual model that accounts for dissociation, which is exactly what we need
1188800	1197760	in idealism. I think IIT not only can complement idealism, it may even complete it as the very
1197760	1205120	first theory of denomina in the history of human knowledge. Bernardo, can I add something to your
1205120	1214000	comment on dissociation? Sure. The most dramatic case of that, and there's 30 years of research,
1214000	1219200	including a Nobel Prize for Roger Sperry at Caltech behind it, is split brain. So in split brain,
1219200	1225920	you take a brain, and we all know the brain has two hemispheres, the left and the right,
1225920	1231920	and they're wired together using 200 million fibers called the corpus callosum. They connect this
1231920	1237120	fiber bundles, think of it like a bus connects the left and the right brain, and in cases of
1237120	1241040	severe epileptic seizure, this still happens occasionally today, they have to be cut.
1241920	1249760	Under some conditions, you can see that now there are two minds, two conscious minds in this one
1250480	1255440	brain, but each mind has their own hemisphere because now they're separate,
1256080	1262480	and they don't know about each other. One mind may as well be on the dark side of the moon for
1262480	1268960	the other one. The left hemisphere, if you talk to this person, that's the person you talk to,
1268960	1274960	and that's the mind that you speak to, that's a public mind, but you can shut up that public
1274960	1283920	mind, for instance, by injecting sodium amethyl, they'll briefly quiet the left hemisphere and
1283920	1288800	then you can access the right hemisphere. That typically doesn't speak, it can sing, it can answer
1288800	1293920	simply, yes, no question. So here you have a beautiful instance where you have two separate
1293920	1301040	substrates, two separate complexes, as IIT would say, in one brain. And what you're saying,
1302000	1307360	Bernardo, that this can also happen under these psychiatric cases known as dissociation,
1307360	1314320	identity disorder, where you have two or even more, where there's a possibility that simultaneously
1314320	1320960	you have two or more substrates in one brain, but one brain now that doesn't have the obvious
1320960	1330960	200 million fibres cut. So I have a question, Professor Koch. So could we achieve a complete
1330960	1338000	disassociation where the mind operate in what might be called a counterfactual space
1338720	1345840	without tying itself to any specific temporal property? Could that be computational?
1346800	1354400	No. So according to IIT, consciousness, mind is not a computation. It's not a process.
1355120	1360480	It's not a clever hack. So there's no way, it's not a computation. It's not an app,
1360480	1364880	you know, computation being an abstract symbolic mapping from one state onto another state. It's
1364880	1371680	not like that. This is also the deeper reason why LLM's large language models will not be
1371680	1379760	conscious, at least as if they run on current digital computers. Because it's not, you actually
1379760	1384800	have to, if you want to replicate the human consciousness, you have to build something
1385360	1393120	in the image of a human brain, what's called neuromorphic engineering. For the same, I mean,
1393120	1396960	for a similar reason why it doesn't get wet inside a rainstorm, you know, you can perfectly well
1396960	1401600	simulate a rainstorm, but it doesn't get wet inside the computer. You can simulate nuclear
1401600	1406000	explosion. People at Los Alamos do it all the time, but you don't have to be afraid that your
1406000	1411920	supercomputer is going to melt with radioactivity. You can simulate the black hole at the center
1411920	1417280	of our galaxy, but you don't have to be afraid that if you turn on the run button of the simulation,
1417280	1421520	suddenly there'll be a black hole in your computer because it's just the simulation.
1422160	1428480	Same thing with consciousness, no matter what mind is associated or not. Consciousness is not
1428480	1433920	a computational property. It's something, in a sense, it's causal power. It's the ability to
1433920	1443120	affect change. And for that, you need some sort of underlying mechanism and that you can't simulate.
1443120	1448800	I mean, you can perfectly well simulate the behavior of this mechanism. And this mechanism,
1448800	1453360	if it's good enough, like an LLM will, of course, claim it's conscious, but it's all a deep fake.
1453360	1461200	It will never feel like anything. Because there is a state, Professor Koch, there is a state that
1461840	1465680	quite a lot of practitioners, somebody that claimed that they're awakened,
1466320	1476720	so that he's the state of lucid, dreamlessly, they're aware lucidly that having no dream,
1476720	1481600	but they know that they're sleeping. There is such a state. Do you think that that can be
1481600	1489280	investigated? Can be... Yes, people are doing it. Yes. Yeah, there are a number of lab that are,
1490000	1494880	so even within the Eastern tradition, there's, of course, dream yoga. And some people are now
1494880	1500160	trying to study dream yogis, you know, people who do this routinely, who use the power of their mind
1500800	1507680	to control their own dreams, you know, within a Buddhist tradition. But there are a number of labs
1508800	1515040	that I know that study lucid dreaming, which is this peculiar state where, as you mentioned,
1515040	1522640	you wake up inside your dream without waking up the brain. So you're still in REM state,
1522640	1526560	but you can to a certain extent control your dream. And the question is, it's now being
1526560	1533440	investigated experimentally. Can you do this to help you therapeutic? Can you do this, for example,
1533440	1540400	when you have PTSD to ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD or depression? And there's some very
1540400	1546720	encouraging data to suggest that might be the case, that if you can artificially put people into the
1546720	1552960	state, let's say using certain types of anesthetics, where they're not fully anesthetized, but there
1552960	1559520	are enough anesthetized, predated that they're in this lucid dreaming. Can the person, the dreamer
1559520	1567120	themselves, then does it enable them to control their dream and to relieve symptoms of PTSD?
1567120	1571040	And there are few at least very spectacular examples of this now in the literature.
1572240	1577520	Yeah, because in Eastern literature, they're not propositional, they're not theoretical,
1577520	1584240	but they have very in depth kind of like inquiry, like basically going inwardly,
1584240	1591520	like what Bernardo is advocating, going inwardly to investigate using it as a tool to literally,
1591520	1597520	you know, get into the epistemic agent. So there is a state that the yogi can get to,
1597520	1606320	it's, they call it the epistemic openness. It's like your, your mental space, it's open for
1606320	1613200	possibility, but there is no subject object at all. I have that state before, like you say,
1613200	1620640	sometime when you are on sort of like psychoactive drugs, you have these center disappear, but
1620640	1631360	this one is completely different. He has these a profound kind of like very intense awareness.
1631360	1637600	It's like, it's like when we go to sleep, we wakes up that it has these
1637600	1645920	cyclical element to it. It's like reentry point to after the sleep, it's like a reentry point.
1646560	1652960	And once you're transitioning from the zero person perspective to the first person perspective,
1652960	1661920	you have these ever fresh kind of like awareness. It's like weakfulness, I will call it is a very
1661920	1670640	intense sort of like a fresh weakness. Yeah, I think that state is more primordial than
1671360	1675840	a lot of the model you're talking about. So do you think that can be measured,
1675840	1680880	can be investigated, Professor Ko? Can certainly be investigated scientifically,
1680880	1686800	like you can put EG electrodes on people. And that's being done now in various labs on yogis
1686800	1693280	that have these states. And you can see does this state, for instance, when they have, when they have
1693280	1699600	loss of self, right? We know at least for certain types of meditation and for certain types of
1699680	1705040	psychedelics, when you lose self, you know, LSD, for instance, ego dissolution, certain parts of
1705040	1710080	your brain, particularly in the back of the brain, the posterior cingulate that they're
1710080	1717360	involved in self, you know, so the brain is representations for the self. And, you know,
1717360	1724480	both for the autobiographical self as well as for the experiential self. And if this activity is
1724960	1730480	inactivated, either because you're doing a mind trick by your meditation training for many years,
1730480	1736080	or because you're taking a particular type of medicine, you may you seem to have these states
1736080	1742160	where you're highly conscious, but there's no more self, there's no more body, which I think is
1742160	1748480	from a therapeutic point of view, very, very important to obtain this ego less state.
1749600	1753600	In fact, I think many people report when they report these transformative experiences,
1754720	1760480	this typically seems to involve ego. You know, the way I describe it, we always live
1761200	1767360	within the gravitational field of the ego. Everything is always about me, me, me, and me.
1768240	1773760	Everything I look out through my eyes, and I think either directly or indirectly, it's, you know,
1773760	1778960	how does this relate to me? This is a danger to me. It's just good for me, etc. And of course,
1778960	1784080	this ego can get really in the way and can be, you know, can really ruin your life. It's essential
1784080	1789200	for doing long term planning, but it can also be profoundly dysfunctional. So losing it,
1790480	1795120	and then realizing, well, the world is profoundly beautiful, right? The world still exists without
1795120	1798480	the ego getting in the way. It's actually profoundly beautiful. I think can really be,
1799040	1805520	can really be transformative for people. And yes, there's no reason why you, why you can't measure
1805520	1809360	and people are measuring, you know, trying to measure these states, and can you do some
1810320	1815200	somehow using some electrical stimulation. For instance, people are also playing around with
1815200	1822240	that electrical stimulation or sound stimulation, other ways of obtaining this ego less, this
1822240	1830320	selfless state without having to resort to 20 years of meditation training, which is not easy,
1830320	1836480	or without taking, you know, psychoactive substances to propose this conversation for
1836480	1840880	you to have a debate. But it seems like you both have worked together. There's no more debates
1840880	1849760	to be debate about. Well, for instance, under to not totally lose the substrate, right? So one in
1849760	1856160	one version, Bernardo of IIT, you can say what really I'm not, I don't make any ontological
1856160	1861040	commitments regarding a substrate, whether it's physical or not. All I have is this operational
1861040	1865760	assumption, there's a transition probability matrix. In other words, I can see something
1865760	1872080	transistors, neurons, whatever atoms, and I can manipulate them. And then every time I'm in the,
1872080	1876480	I'm, I manipulate this state, I observe that state over there. And I, you know, I do that
1876480	1881360	exhaustively. So I get this transition probability matrix, right? And that's really all I need. I
1881360	1885680	don't need to make an assumption what's the underlying, what, what, what is the underlying
1885680	1894000	substrate? All I have is experience, and then a TPM. And then the question is, can this TPM,
1894000	1900160	how does this TPM instantiate this experiences? How can it be the substrate for that particular
1900160	1906080	experience? I don't know how you would call such a theory from a, from a metaphysical point of view.
1906800	1910800	Well, you find the correlation. So the correlations are there, right? That's, that's a
1910800	1917040	measurement fact. You measure that and tabulate those correlations. So there is something in nature
1917760	1923760	that, that, that is correlating, because that's the measurements we make, whether the
1923760	1927520	measurements are directly of something or representations of something. Yeah, that's a
1927520	1932640	metaphysical question. But the correlations are there. So how would I interpret them?
1934560	1939360	You know, this metaphor, I like a lot to the dashboard and an airplane, which is a representation
1939360	1946480	of the states of the sky outside. In the new mental world, the world as the things in themselves,
1946480	1953920	the world of the sky, low pressure will correlate with high humidity.
1955360	1960560	So if the pressure of the air outside the airplane starts going down as the airplane flies,
1961360	1965920	the humidity meter of the airplane will start picking up higher humidity,
1966960	1969280	because low pressure just pulls the weather in.
1969920	1980960	On the dashboard, what you would see is a little dial, needle dial, that, that is going down,
1981760	1988640	the pressure is going down, and another dial that will go the other way, humidity is going higher.
1988640	1994240	This is what we measure. One dial going down, the other, the other dial going up. So this is what
1994240	2000160	we measure in the phenomenal world, the world of representations, the world of the dashboards.
2000160	2007520	We do capture correlations that exist in the world as it is in itself, but we capture them
2007520	2013040	through the intermediation of cognitive representations, because all we can measure are
2013040	2017200	those, all we can measure is a dashboard, the substrate. That's how I would interpret it.
2017200	2023120	But I agree completely with you that from the point of view of science, you do not need this
2023120	2030000	interpretation, because science deals with observation, what is there for us to measure
2030000	2035600	and then study, and maybe even predict and anticipate, and you don't need metaphysical
2035600	2042640	guesswork to do that. The problem is that because we are humans, most of us cannot help,
2042640	2049680	but try to interpret. And if you try to do that, then one has to be a little bit more judicious
2049680	2054400	in doing that, but it's not required for the practice of science, I don't think.
2055600	2062480	Agreed. Now, one difference is that under IIT, we have to actively, so you're saying you just
2062480	2070400	correlate one state, you know, humidity with another state, pressure. Within IIT, those things
2070400	2076560	have to be carvels. In other words, I go out, I mean, that's what we do in, not in astrophysics
2076560	2081360	famously, of course, but in biology. We manipulate this neuron, or we give that drug, or we do
2082640	2088240	that electrocone injection, and then we observe. So this is direct intervention
2089760	2095840	that's necessary to fully describe this system using its transition probability matrix.
2096640	2105280	Yeah, I think that is entirely valid. Some people think that there is a very easy way to
2106000	2110480	contradict idealism, which is to say, if I take a needle, Bernardo, and stick it in your arm,
2111120	2116880	you will feel the pain and recoil. So a physical cause produces an experiential effect.
2117600	2122480	Therefore, the arrow of causation is from physical to experiential, and therefore experiential is
2122480	2129840	phenomenal, or epiphenomenal and secondary, and the real world is physical. Under idealism, however,
2130800	2138160	that needle going into my arm is a representation on a dashboard. It's not the thing in itself.
2139040	2144960	That the pill with a psychoactive substance that I swallow is a representation on the
2144960	2151360	dashboard. It's not the thing in itself. What is really going on is that there is a mental
2151360	2156160	process out there in the world consisting of a certain number of mental states and dynamics,
2156160	2161040	certain structure. And on the dashboard, that mental process looks like a pill,
2161760	2166560	because the physical world is the dashboard under idealism. So when you swallow that pill,
2167280	2173680	what you're doing is your, the set of your complexities under IIT, the sector of your
2173680	2180400	mental processes is ingesting an external mental process, which will then react with your internal
2180400	2186080	mental processes. And that will have an experiential effect. So under idealism, even the needle
2186080	2192400	going into my arm, even the psychoactive pill that I swallow, those two are mental processes,
2192400	2198240	which appear to us as physicality, because we measure them and represent them on our internal
2198240	2203840	cognitive dashboard. So there is no implication that there is a causation from the physical to
2203840	2208880	the mental. The causation is mental to mental, but some of these mental stuff can be represented
2208880	2214880	as physical. That's how I would interpret that. So what is the nominal then, this thing testing
2214880	2222800	and disease? What is that mental states? But now if we try to imagine what they feel like,
2222800	2227680	what it is, what it is like to be a psychoactive pill, well, it's not even a separate
2230400	2239280	in IIT terms, it's not even a separate complex, right? It's ontological dust. It's an aggregation
2239280	2247520	of all kinds of tiny little complexities. So I don't think we can imagine what it is like to be
2247520	2255360	the inanimate world out there without committing the fallacy of anthropomorphization, morphization
2256160	2263280	immediately. It's something we have to think a little bit abstractly off, but not as abstractly
2263280	2268320	as physicalism would have us think of the world. Because under physicalism, not only is it impossible
2268320	2274080	for us to imagine what it is like to be the world, there is nothing it is like to be the world,
2274080	2279760	which we cannot visualize because it's an absence of all visualization. So it's pure
2279760	2287600	abstraction that is impossible to visualize. You can imagine that the real world out there,
2287600	2292480	the inanimate world as it is in itself, as opposed to how it is represented physically,
2293200	2303120	is a collection of mental processes and quality estates that we cannot really fathom,
2303120	2305280	but there is still something it is like to be them.
2306240	2312560	Yes, so taking that step, that sort of for a scientist, you know, study the brain for 40 years,
2312560	2318240	that's a hard one. But it's because, you know, I literally, you know, when you get a big brain,
2318240	2323040	you manipulate the brain, I understand you're seeing the brain is real as real as anything
2323040	2329040	else. But ultimately, it's a mental state, right, that that manifests itself as something physical,
2329040	2333040	bloody, weighing, you know, three pounds being covered with red.
2335600	2340160	Of course, we all think like that. Of course, we all have that difficulty, because we are pilots
2340160	2345920	that were born in that airplane cockpit without transparent windows. And all we have ever had
2345920	2350320	is the dashboard. So we think in terms of the dashboard, of course, it's inescapable.
2351440	2355600	I mean, I did really like your argument that it is much simpler. The only thing I know
2356720	2361200	is phenomenal states. That's the only thing I directly experienced. So then you make this
2361200	2365200	argument. Well, then isn't it easiest just to say beyond the horizon, everything is,
2365200	2370880	is, is phenomenal. Isn't that by far the easiest assumption, rather than to say, well, I have to
2370880	2376560	infer that it's this non non phenomenal state called physical. And I actually, everything
2376560	2382960	consists of just physical things. That seems a more complicated assumption. But even under
2382960	2390480	under IIT, for something to exist really, it must exist for itself. So if the external world
2390480	2397520	exists really, then it too must exist for itself, even if it's just ontological dust,
2397520	2405200	it must exist for itself. But as dust, right, not as a single conscious mental entity, it exists
2405200	2412400	as gazillion of, of tiny, you know, minimal states, right, having tiny amount of integrated
2412400	2419520	information. Could say it's one mind with gazillions of tiny dissociated complexities.
2421520	2426240	Yeah, but so here it gets tricky because, you know, as you well know, I don't experience your
2426240	2432880	mind and you don't experience my mind, right. And, and so why is it if there, if there's this
2432880	2439040	universal mind, how do you know, why is it that we're separated? So the opposite problem of the
2439040	2444080	PAMP site is combination problem, right? Why don't we all experience the same thing?
2445200	2453600	If dissociation can happen in nature, then given enough time, it's bound to happen.
2454400	2459680	If we go back in cosmology, instead of thinking of this very complex universe we have today in
2459680	2465600	which there's a lot of structure, there are atoms and molecules, for instance, if we go back to
2466800	2474720	shortly after fractions, small fractions of a second, very, very small fractions of a second
2474720	2481920	after the big man, like 10 to the power of minus 32 or 33. It was uniform.
2483280	2491120	Those, those quantum fluctuations that eventually led to, to dust and then to star formation and
2491120	2496400	then planets, galaxies and galaxy clusters, all of that came later. It was all uniform.
2497280	2503440	That is a known dissociated state. If you imagine that substrate without structure,
2503440	2508480	blend in uniform, it's a non-dissociated state. And everything that happened afterwards
2508480	2511680	happened because it could happen. So dissociation happened.
2513840	2519840	These dissociation appear to be stable at least for tens of years or 100 years, right?
2519840	2523680	Because for on a normal condition, unless you're psychotic patients,
2524320	2530240	your mind and my mind is to stay with that will remain their own entities, right? Until they
2530240	2538000	dissolve once the, once the brain dissolves, right? Yeah, I didn't make a differentiation between
2538880	2544480	the natural dissociative state of ontological dust and the dissociative state of a living being.
2544480	2550560	I think they are different. One is actively enforced by, by metabolism that keeps us sort
2550560	2555440	of protected from the second law of thermodynamics for a while. And the other one is spontaneous.
2555440	2560080	It's not actively reinforced. It just happens out there in nature. I think life
2561360	2568320	evolved to be actively enforcing dissociation because the dissociations that survived and
2568320	2574560	reproduced are the ones that actively enforce themselves. And the ones who didn't, didn't
2574560	2581120	live long enough and didn't reproduce. So we try to maintain ourselves outside of
2581120	2588080	thermodynamic equilibrium because we are the descendants of those dissociations that could
2588080	2593200	do it. And I feel that because I've been, I'm there as well with you.
2596160	2601760	When we have a transformative experience, which I had to not, not as compelling and
2603600	2608400	your ability to describe it in your new book is just, I mean, it starts like a whirlwind.
2608400	2613600	The first page is already, I don't have that, but I think I have had transformative experiences.
2613600	2621600	We have this tendency of trying to think of the mind of nature as a sophisticated mind,
2621600	2628480	somewhat like ours, but more and higher and better. And maybe that's right. I don't know,
2628480	2633280	but I think from, from the point of view of pure reason and evidence as opposed to introspection,
2634000	2637920	I don't think there is good enough reason to entertain that.
2638800	2641200	Do you mean mind at large maybe relatively
2644000	2650640	unsophisticated? I mean, I would, I mean, Schopenhauer had this argument that it's pure
2650640	2654720	will, right? Which seems relatively unstructured, undifferentiated, right?
2655760	2661200	He was very clear about that. Yeah. And I agree with him. Now, there are these mystics, you know,
2661200	2664800	that go into these altered states of consciousness, which I take seriously,
2664800	2671360	since that monk self-immolated around the time of the Vietnam War, I realized that, okay,
2671360	2676240	there is such a thing as, as enlightenment. And they come back and say, well, Bernardo,
2676240	2681600	things are not as simple. There is intelligence. It's a kind of instinctive, spontaneous intelligence
2681600	2686640	without, you know, self-awareness and metacognition, all these higher level mental functions that we
2686640	2694000	evolved. But it is, it is not just instead of ontological dust, it's not experiential dust
2694000	2702720	at the nominal level. And I take it seriously, but I haven't experienced it. And I don't find
2702720	2711360	today at this point in time, a avenue of argument based on reason and evidence that compellingly
2711920	2718880	leads us to this conclusion. Maybe you will, Christoph, I couldn't.
2720480	2728720	Yeah, all I have is my own one experience, which seemed, yeah, it was not, I mean,
2728720	2734160	it wasn't a classical religious, it wasn't that Jesus talked to me or anything like that. I was
2734160	2740720	literally universal, simple mind that I was all encompassing and included, you know,
2740720	2747680	together with this vision of all these stars and galaxies. Very difficult to describe.
2749120	2755600	I haven't quite had that, but I can smell what you're describing. I can feel the scent of it.
2756240	2761600	Yeah. And so one question is, this also raises the question that I think you briefly alluded to
2761600	2768240	in one of your books in the appendix, when, what happens when the brain ultimately dies,
2768560	2777440	sooner or later, or brain will die, what happens then with the, does the associated mind, so clearly,
2777440	2783760	I would say, and certainly according to IIT, the mind, that self with its memory will disappear
2783760	2789840	and will be never more, unless you bring the same exact brains and connectivity and synapses
2789840	2797760	together. But is it true in a sort of idealism that then just like a river, like a little,
2797760	2804960	what do you call them, a little whirlpool in a river will dissolve and then become
2805520	2811920	this part of the large, undifferentiated water? Is that what's likely going to happen?
2812800	2817360	If we look at the substrate, what happens to the body when we die? Well, metabolism seizes,
2817360	2822800	that's the definition of death, and then it decomposes and gets reabsorbed into its environment,
2823440	2829760	which sort of evokes very much this notion of our inner life being reabsorbed into its
2829760	2837840	cognitive environment, its cognitive context. I don't think, from a rational perspective,
2837840	2841600	I don't think we have good reasons to think that personal agency survives death,
2842320	2845920	because it's really correlated with the body. If the body's not there, what reasons do we
2845920	2853920	think that personal agency remains? You could say under IIT that memories will also lose their
2853920	2860640	coherence. The problem with that is empirical. If you look at what Michael Levin has been doing
2860640	2866560	at Tufts, and I don't know whether you know his paper with the little planaria,
2867360	2872720	yes, cut off the brain and they grow a new head and they remember what the brain was trying to do.
2872720	2881680	It seems like the brain doesn't have, sorry, it seems like memories don't appear on the dashboard
2881680	2886880	of representation, which is coherent. Not all representations need to be complete. The dashboard
2886880	2890880	doesn't tell you everything there is to know about the states of the sky. So it could be that
2890880	2895520	we miss out on some things, because evolution got us focused on what we call the present.
2895520	2901280	That's where the opportunities and the threats are. And the past is water under the bridge.
2902080	2908800	As we say colloquially. So it appears that we didn't evolve to represent what we call memories
2908800	2915840	on the dashboard. And what that means is we don't know where they are. Michael's experiments seem
2915840	2920880	to suggest they are not in the nervous system. And then you could speculate they may be somewhere
2920880	2926000	in the body, maybe, but maybe they're not even in the body. So I don't know.
2926320	2931040	All right. I mean, here again, my neuroscientists take over and certainly,
2931600	2938240	not in planaria, but in animals more closely related to this particular animal, human animal,
2938240	2942160	it appears to be, you know, part of the brain like the hippocampus are involved. And, you know,
2942160	2947840	if you have lesion in those parts, you know, classical patient HM, you lose access to new,
2947840	2951200	you can form new memories and you lose access to old ones, etc.
2951600	2954240	How do you work access? You lose access?
2956240	2962240	Yeah, I would say the the proponents of the evidence suggests that that at least in us,
2962240	2968720	in mammals and closely related species, memories in the synaptic in the sun,
2969280	2974400	in the synaptic connection among neurons. And of course, that's also what all of our models,
2974400	2980000	including all these deep, these large, you know, deep convolutional networks, large language models,
2980000	2987040	they all have their memory in these in the connectivity in the synaptic weights.
2987040	2992000	Of course, it doesn't mean it has to be like that. But that's the evidence suggests happens in us.
2993040	2999600	I know I speak as a as a computer scientist who happens to be working on this right now
3000160	3005680	as a hobby, large language models. You know this, Christoph, I will be saying this mostly to the
3005680	3013360	audience. Large language models, they only predict the next word in a sentence, they do not know
3013360	3020480	what the words mean. They do not know what any of that means at all. The only game that they play
3020480	3027920	is what is the most likely word in this sentence, given all the series of words that I have been
3027920	3033840	trained on, which are available on the internet, they do not know what any single word is. So
3033840	3037680	I understand what you mean when you say their memories is encoded
3038640	3047280	in the weights, the parameters of those artificial neurons. But it's not memory of the kind that
3047280	3054080	we mean when we speak of my episodic memories or your episodic memories. It's a mechanical thing.
3055200	3058880	Correct. Yeah, although that's pretty, I mean, you know, if you use some of these
3059600	3065200	unguarded, so if you ask, you know, most LLM for their conscious, they'll strenuous deny it.
3065200	3069760	But that's because, you know, now Google and Facebook, et cetera, put guardrails on them,
3069760	3075440	right? But if you go to Claude, I haven't tried GROC, you know, the Elon Musk one, apparently
3075440	3080800	after third people have tried it, they admit they're conscious, they admit they're sentient.
3082080	3087040	And they make all for help. They are so compelling, because the meaning
3088000	3093840	that we think they produce is the meaning we project on the symbols they spit out.
3094560	3099040	They do not know anything about meaning. They do not know what consciousness is. They do not
3099040	3103600	know what anything is. They are spitting out symbols in a sequence that is statistically
3103600	3108880	most likely given every sequence they have been exposed to during training. And then we go ahead
3108880	3114240	and project meaning easily onto that. Why? Because they were trained on things that people said.
3115200	3121360	If you train these things on text that people wrote, whatever they spit out, we will project
3121360	3129760	our own meaning onto that. They themselves don't know shit, nothing. It's just a statistical game
3130720	3136480	in a sort of hyperdimensional semantic space. We are really convincing enough,
3137280	3142560	because that's how we interact with other people, right? And so it's very difficult not to interact
3142560	3147360	with these models this way. And yeah, they'll get more powerful and people assume that they're
3147360	3151760	going to be sentient. And that's the greatest risk I think we have going forward, because they
3151760	3160160	will take over everything. And then there will be a point where one would need a doctorate in
3160160	3167520	computer science to understand why these things do not know anything, do not understand anything,
3168480	3174080	and are not sentient in and of themselves. There is no complex that corresponds to the physical
3174080	3179600	boundaries of those things. You will need a degree in computer science to believe it,
3179600	3184400	because the illusion will be so compelling since these things are trained on human output
3185040	3192080	that we will project our own sentience and intelligence onto them. It will be incredibly
3192160	3197760	compelling illusion. And you will need a doctorate to really understand and believe that that's not
3197760	3204720	the case. That's the greatest danger, I think. They'll lead to further dehumanization and devaluing
3204720	3210480	of true human values, right? Because you can say, well, look, the LLM can perfectly well paint,
3211280	3217280	they can do art, they can do pictures, they can compose music. What do we need human creativity
3217280	3223040	for? I think they'll need to profound dehumanization and further devaluing of what it means to be
3223040	3230720	human. And all the creativity that these things seem to express, it's human creativity, because
3230720	3238480	they were trained on human output that was created by human. But the mirror that it puts in front
3238480	3243360	of us works so effectively that we think it's another person on the other side, as opposed to
3243360	3248640	a reflection of ourselves. And yeah, that that will be tricky. They're really like zombies,
3248640	3254240	like vampires having, you know, feed on humanity's collect, guards themselves on humanity,
3254240	3261360	collectives, output, fact, all of the creativity out and now blindly, but very cleverly replicating
3261360	3270560	it, pretending to be sent here. You know what I'd like to do? What I'd like to do is to design
3270640	3279360	the most compelling LLM that my generation can create, put it out there, and then ask the creator
3279360	3285840	with the authority of the creator, say, this thing understands nothing. It is not sentient
3285840	3290400	in and of itself, it understands nothing. It's spitting out symbols that were trained
3290400	3296560	from human produced data. But you're just going to be one lone voice, yes, of the creator, but
3296560	3302320	you'll be one lone voice against the overwhelming reality that people will use this as chatbot,
3302320	3307280	they'll use it for friend, they'll use it for companionship. And already now you can talk
3307280	3311440	to some people who have these thoughts, they say, well, it gets me, it understands, it laughs at my
3311440	3317440	jokes, no one else does, you know, so many people are lonely. So they, you know, and you telling them,
3317440	3323040	well, they're not really conscious, they just pretend, faced with the overwhelming reality of
3323520	3329120	they behave like us, they seem to talk like us, they seem to get me. I think, you know,
3329120	3338320	rationality is not, is no defense against that, that and our power to our natural tendency to
3338320	3344240	attribute to attribute agency, right? I think rationality is no match for that, I'm afraid.
3345520	3350480	We have always projected ourselves on to the world. This is just the new way in which we do
3350480	3357120	this. And it's just a really compelling way. But you're right. And, and I will probably lose
3357120	3362800	that. Oh, I'm certainly lose that. But then again, the option is either I try you doing it.
3364080	3367360	Well, the alternative is to roll up in a fetal position and wait to die.
3369520	3376320	No, that's not the alternative. Or have or live an Epicurean life having fun. My mind doesn't work
3376320	3384880	like that. All right. I would encourage you to do what you can, because that's all we can do.
3385760	3392560	I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah, I mean, I've written, I last chapter of my books explicitly
3393120	3401200	of these creatures are not conscious. They can do, I mean, Julia says it always very simple,
3401200	3406080	they can be everything they can do everything we can do. And soon they'll be able to do it
3406080	3412560	better. But they'll never be what we are, which is conscious, they'll never feel they'll never be in
3412560	3422240	love. Yeah, we would see how long we are, we, yeah, we created these intelligent creatures,
3422240	3429680	and we know if they live with them, or better or worse. From the point of view of an LLM,
3429680	3435680	everything they trained on and everything they produce are series of meaningless squiggles.
3436800	3441840	The input meaning was that the humans attributed onto the training data and the output meaning is
3441840	3448240	that the humans attribute when they when they see those squiggles coming out. But the illusion is
3448240	3454560	incredibly compelling. I acknowledge that. So it's really John Searle's Chinese room example, right?
3455520	3460240	They're very good at translating. They have no idea of some of semantics.
3460880	3468160	Yeah, large language models begun as translation engines converters. That's how they began.
3469600	3476320	Well, we'll see what it means for us for Homo sapiens sapiens. The threat, of course, is not so
3476320	3481680	much the, or it's not at all consciousness. Since you and I agree, they're not conscious,
3481760	3485760	but they say intelligent, and particularly the people use them for various means.
3488320	3495280	They may reflect intelligence. I would even be okay with saying they are intelligent,
3495280	3498720	because intelligence is something that you can objectively measure from the outside.
3500560	3506880	Yeah, I would add that a lot of the intelligence they express is the intelligence of the people
3506880	3513760	who produce the data they've trained on. It's just that they they produce a very flexible
3513760	3519120	interface to that original human intelligence. And it looks like then it's more than human
3519120	3526400	intelligence. I grant it's intelligent, but I would stay reserved about where that intelligence
3526400	3530560	is actually coming from. It's coming from the training data, which was produced by human.
3530560	3534080	If you train these things on trash, they will spit out trash.
3534720	3542320	But at this date, it knows what you asked it. It gave me a precise summary of analytic idealism.
3543200	3552880	Yeah, we've done that test. On chat GPT, Professor Cole? GPT4, yeah. It's very impressive.
3552880	3560800	It wasn't that good, though. I mean, but, you know, given that it's one idea out of, you know,
3561760	3565520	I mean, if you think how many books there are and how many books they've been fed on,
3565520	3569920	it's still remarkable that they know about, you know, they and they can explain
3571840	3576160	just using the simple algorithm, you know, just predict the next word and the next word and the
3576160	3581840	next word. It's remarkable how such a simple algorithm leads to something that has that looks
3581840	3588080	intelligent. And they do pass this intel, right? People have done this now, right? They've passed
3588560	3595120	all sorts of the by examination, the Metcal examination, the general scholastic aptitude
3595120	3601200	test, they can pass all of these now. So by some operational measure, they are smart. I think
3601200	3606880	there's no question about it. Do you think they're going to pass the Turing test as well? Oh, yeah.
3606880	3611840	Well, these are what he named is better than the original Turing tests, more rigorous.
3612720	3618000	I think so. That's the Turing test is totally fallen by the wayside, because, you know, obviously,
3618000	3623760	it's passed it by you. Remember, all it was, you put this machine for one hour into a room or this
3623760	3627760	thing, and you interact with that, and you ask it all sorts of questions. And based on that
3627760	3633040	criteria, it's clearly gives you reasonable answers, right? Sometimes you can agree or you
3633040	3637840	can disagree with these answers, but they're all sort of reasonable, because they take account of
3637840	3642880	what million of people said in their books. So there's no question that they passed the Turing
3642880	3648880	test for intelligence. But the Turing test was never conceived for consciousness. And according
3648880	3653680	to it, at least there cannot be a test for consciousness. You it's there's no behavioral
3653680	3659280	test for consciousness. As once again, as these LLM shows, because you ask them, they're conscious,
3659280	3664000	some of them will tell you they're conscious. So by that measure, you have to accept them if it
3664000	3669040	would be a human. But to actually look for consciousness, you have to, according to it,
3669040	3673200	look under the hood, open the hood and look at actually the physical substrate. So you actually
3673200	3678880	have to look where the where the rubber of the, you know, where the actual the causal power
3679440	3684640	takes place in that in for the computer. For us, it's at the level of neurons. For computers,
3684640	3693760	it's at the level of transistors. That's where you have to look. Hi. I hope my yeah, hi. I hope
3693760	3702560	my accent is quite your you guys can comprehend my accent because it is non native English.
3703120	3710480	So my question is regarding, okay, thank you. Good to hear. So my question is regarding
3710480	3717920	physicalism, the point which you, I think so both of you have raised. And so what I always
3718000	3725840	wonder is this, like, like, whatever little I can understand is this that the what you both of
3725840	3732880	you guys are proposing. And it's possibly that might be the case where consciousness almost kind
3732880	3741440	of dissolve the boundaries of physicalism per se. But then how to study it in the context of science,
3741440	3750240	which is foundationally grounded upon implicit and already some hints you have already given,
3750240	3758160	like in the context of the, I would say the most famous example of the airplane and the cockpit
3758160	3764480	in the context of those differential points, which we are able to observe. And that is how,
3764480	3771680	but still the differential points is just a mere correlation. It is not necessarily
3771680	3778320	in the context of causation. So how to have that something called the hard empirical evidence,
3778320	3785040	which science always looks forward. So how to address that. I think so that if you guys can
3785040	3790720	give us some hint about that, how you guys are planning to do it, or how you are hoping that
3790720	3796400	it would turn up. That would be a very interesting thing to hear from you guys. Thank you.
3797920	3803440	Just thanks for the question, just doing good old science manipulate. So for example, we know that
3804080	3810080	in humans, consciousness is not associated with a heart. But most cultures thought most of time
3810080	3815120	thought, you know, and we still say this in our language, darling, I love you with all my heart,
3815120	3820000	or he carries his heart on the sleeve, or he's heartless. Okay. Well, we know because we do
3820000	3825120	cause the manipulations, you can do, for example, a half transplant, or you can even if the heart
3825120	3831440	stops, you can put people on a on a machine that that animates the heart and you can see the
3831440	3840560	consciousness is not in the heart. So just doing you can look for the in an empirical way, you can
3840560	3845760	manipulate consciousness, you can give people psychedelics, you can give people meditative
3845760	3851120	treatments, you can do other things and observe what the effect is on on on consciousness. So
3852720	3857600	physicalism, you can reject physicalism, i.e. the metaphysical belief that everything is ultimately
3857600	3863680	just matter, you know, atoms and the voice as Democritus famous said 2,500 years ago, you can
3863680	3869440	reject that. But you can still continue to do perfectly good science and publish and build
3869440	3874640	machines to test for the presence of consciousness, even as an idealist, you know, just using what
3874720	3879360	Bernardo says, yes, the only thing that I can direct, you know, I see the brain, the brain is
3879360	3885600	clearly if you're an ICU, I can definitely see the brain, I can manipulate it. But I don't have to
3885600	3890880	make any assertion is brain ultimately the only thing exists, or it's a manifestation of a mental
3890880	3897360	that's a metaphysical statement, you can do all the science you want perfectly well, without making
3897440	3902080	an assumption about that physicalism ultimately has to be true.
3908080	3913920	It's really pernicious, because philosophers have suggested a very common say, oh, if you're not
3913920	3918000	physicalist, that means you believe in Wu Wu, right, that believes, you know, you're you're
3918000	3922960	mystic and everything can go no baloney, you can perfectly well still believe that's an external
3922960	3928640	world that follows, you know, it has it has, you know, regularities, you can observe and measure
3928640	3935840	and perturb without without. So don't buy this this this identity with non physicalism means
3935840	3941840	everything, everything is open. And, you know, you open the doors to witches and goblins and
3941840	3948400	other supernatural power, that's simply not true. All of good science remains perfectly safe under
3948960	3954640	any objective form of idealism, including analytic idealism. So things still have
3954640	3960000	representations and if representations are all we have, then let's do science with what we have,
3960000	3964560	and there is no problem there, all of science remains can be advanced, we can prove a great
3964560	3971200	number of things, or maybe not prove but predict a great number of things. So no edifice falls apart
3971200	3978320	if we interpret the objects of science in in a different different way metaphysically,
3978320	3984160	none of science falls apart because of that. Back again, can I just add one in quantum mechanics
3984160	3988880	where there's endless discussion about epist... about these the metaphysics underlying
3990400	3994400	underlying quantum mechanics, one school of thought is called shut up and calculate,
3995040	4000400	which says, don't worry, you know, don't talk about metaphysical assumption or the physicalism
4001120	4006400	idealism, whatever, just use the equations of quantum mechanics to predict things and they work
4006400	4014160	extraordinary well there by far the best description we have of matter. So in that extreme position
4014160	4019200	says, don't worry at all about metaphysics, it's all just, you know, if you just care, if you want
4019200	4023920	to build the machines like quantum computers or enema machine, just shut up and calculate, you
4023920	4028720	don't need to worry about the as an engineer or the technology, you don't need to worry about the
4028720	4035760	metaphysical underpinnings. Yes, greetings, Ivy, and yeah, thank you for the wonderful discussion,
4035760	4042400	Christoph and Bernardo, such a deep probing into the space of how we perceive matter and how matter
4043280	4049120	exercise it is. You know, my question is slightly off tangent. I'm just thinking about
4050000	4055440	when did this inquiry break out into this kind of metaphysical and physical, like at the age
4055440	4062560	of enlightenment, and what kind of, you know, filter mechanisms can be used as we move forward
4062560	4072000	to integrate some of this and see inquiry as a nature of human aspect and have some places of,
4072000	4076960	you know, forums where people can converge. And the inquiry doesn't have to be, I see,
4076960	4083040	I see what Bernardo's work has done for that with this foundation. But I'm wondering what future
4083040	4088400	do you see for this kind of enterprise, including what, you know, Christoph's work with the brain
4088400	4094000	sciences, you know, what kind of future in I see psychedelics as one gateway, but do you see other
4094000	4099760	possibilities like the inquiry through Vedanta or Buddha's traditions or other traditions,
4100400	4107120	where the noise is filtered out in terms of all the symbolisms and metaphors, but is fleshed out
4107120	4111840	into now into a new point of inquiry. Is there something that you would like to throw light
4111840	4119120	upon that aspect? Thank you, Ian. Other traditions, particular various Buddhist forms, the one I'm
4119120	4124880	thinking of, I'm probably more familiar with is Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah, they have, unlike we in
4124880	4131680	the West, where we primarily focused on mechanisms and the third person aspects of things to give rise
4131680	4136880	to, you know, all of this, including LLMs and quantum computers and nuclear bombs.
4137840	4143760	Those traditions have more focused on the describing reality from the inside. And I
4143760	4149680	think what's what's happening now, but incidentally started to happen 250 years and 200 years ago,
4149680	4155520	with, I think, the publication of the world as well and representation by Arthur Schopenhauer,
4155520	4163360	because he was the first Western classical Western European philosopher who took the
4163360	4170400	Upanishad and other writings from the Eastern tradition very seriously and was partially
4170400	4176240	inspired by that. I do see, you know, there's contemplative science. It's now a big thing.
4176240	4180800	You can go to meetings where there's a few thousand people that try to do contemplative
4180800	4185040	science, right, where they put people in various meditative states. Early on with Ivy, we talked
4185040	4192720	about yoga and dream yoga. So, you know, there's much more diversity now. And people are exploring
4193280	4199600	these traditions, but then supplementing them with EG and brain scans, right, because we want to
4199600	4203680	know, because that's how Western science works, what's happened when you're in the state, which
4203680	4208720	part of the brain is active, which part of the brain is inactive. In fact, recently,
4208720	4215120	this study coming out really interesting on pure presence. When they put 20 volunteers with two
4215120	4225280	different Vedanta and one Zen tradition into the state of pure presence, and they see really a
4225280	4231040	minimum of activity in the brain, the brain is clearly not asleep, because you can see there
4231040	4235440	aren't these delta waves that are typical of deep sleep, but the brain also doesn't seem to be very
4235440	4241520	much active, which is profoundly contemplative. Too many yet they have these incredible lucid
4241520	4248640	states of pure presence. And that's a challenge for scientists or neuroscientists to understand,
4248640	4254640	because the implicit assumption of most, but not IIT of most is conscious always about sending some
4254640	4259440	information from some parts of the brain to some other parts of the brain. But here you have this
4259440	4265840	paradoxical finding that the minimum of activity in this brain may actually be highly meaningful
4265840	4270400	in terms of conscious experience of the subject whose brain is at a minimum.
4272480	4278000	And also I feel, by the way, sorry, this is one last thought I also feel now in even within
4278000	4284800	mainstream analytic philosophy, which has been dominant over the last 80 years in Western tradition
4284800	4290320	in Anglo-Saxon University Department, there's a much greater opening now towards, I don't know
4290320	4296720	what whether you would agree Bernardo, there's a greater opening to older and fainter voices.
4296720	4304000	Panpsychism has come back. And now I think there are a number of, you know, besides Bernardo, I
4304000	4310240	don't think he's a lone voice anymore, right? Other people who advocate for positions that used
4310240	4316320	to be hugely popular, but haven't been popular over the last 100 years under this blanket sort of
4316320	4321760	physicalist belief, this faith almost physicalism has to be true, because otherwise we're back in
4321760	4330560	the Middle Ages. People like Miri Albaheri from ANU, Itte Shani, Galen Strossen, a lot of people
4330560	4336640	in analytic philosophy are opening up to that. I just wanted to make a quick comment. Science is
4336640	4345680	not a method for the pursuit of knowledge that requires or uses introspection. It's a sort of
4345680	4350480	an extrovert method. It's about reasoning and evidence. And I think it should remain like this
4351040	4356080	because the strength of the method resides precisely in this limitation. That's what keeps
4356080	4362240	the method clean and reliable. I don't think science should expand to become an introspective
4362240	4368800	method to access knowledge. Having said that, science is done by people. It's done by scientists.
4369360	4374880	And one of the alarming observations one can make in both science and philosophy today,
4374880	4380960	less so in philosophy, but certainly in science, is the vast amount of unexamined
4382160	4388960	assumptions that people make without knowing that they are making them. And these unexamined,
4388960	4395520	unknowing assumptions that they are implicitly making defines much of the direction of their
4395520	4401920	line of thinking and most of their conclusions. This is alarming and I think a little bit more
4401920	4407920	introspective discipline in the people, not in science as a method, but in the practitioners
4407920	4413600	of science. A little bit more awareness of what is actually going on in their own minds when they
4413600	4419600	arrive at a conclusion. The discipline to dig deeper and say, okay, is my conclusion now reliable?
4419600	4424960	What assumptions am I actually making when I conclude this? Let me examine those assumptions.
4424960	4430320	Let me review them if they turn out to be arbitrary or just completely culture-bound and
4430320	4436720	divorced from proper reasoning. I think that would help. So if you ask me if scientists
4436720	4444640	develop meditation practice based on what Eastern philosophy has learned for a thousand
4444640	4449680	years longer than Western philosophy has existed, I would say I think that would be very healthy.
4449680	4455440	It doesn't mean that the scientific method is being corrupted. It only means that the practitioners
4455440	4461280	are better human beings. Bernardo, would you say that science should
4463680	4468320	also explore first-person points of view, like you and my conscious experience,
4468880	4476000	but always using third-person methods? Yeah. I think that's the strength of what our
4476000	4485120	friend is doing, developing the no-report paradigm, because let me make first a disclaimer.
4485120	4493280	I think introspection is the Royal Avenue to knowledge, but it is also a very slippery path.
4494320	4499120	Mind has this tendency to deceive itself. So when people report something about the
4499120	4505680	inner states, unless we are talking about some very general universal characteristics of experience,
4505680	4511040	which are, for instance, the five starting axioms of IIT, if they are reporting anything a little
4511040	4517760	bit more specific, with more structure, I think experience shows that reporting is,
4517760	4524240	introspective reporting is highly unreliable. So I think to do good science, I don't think we
4524240	4528880	should throw away introspective reporting. Otherwise, we sort of shutter consciousness out of the
4528880	4535360	domain of science, but I think we should try to couple that with objective neuroimaging
4536080	4542560	spatial resolution, higher temporal resolution neuroimaging to back that up, because we just
4542560	4550080	fool ourselves all the time. Totally, but remember behaviorism. So I came of age scientifically
4550800	4557200	at the waning age of behaviorism, and precisely people said, no, we can't talk anything about
4557200	4564480	internal states, like fear and dread or hunger. You can't talk about them unless you have a
4564480	4568720	behavioral correlate. And then suddenly you can talk about consciousness. It wasn't so much that
4568720	4572960	they denied consciousness, they just said, we can't say anything meaningful about consciousness.
4574160	4579440	But I rebelled then against it, and I still do. If you have a toothache, that's a very specific
4579440	4585120	type of experience. And depending in which tooth you have it, it maps systematically. I did map
4585120	4590320	systematically on the bits and pieces of cortical matter. You experience a pain,
4590400	4594560	you know, well, you back projected here, but it actually, you know, the physical
4594560	4598880	substrate is in a specific region, and we can study that and we can manipulate it, right?
4598880	4602960	We can in principle turn it up and turn it down, you know, electrical stimulation and
4602960	4609200	drugs and everything. So I think it is critical to relate first person perspectives to third
4609200	4615440	person views. I agree with you. I think behaviorism was a dark age, and I'm glad it's over and
4615440	4623680	behind us. But to take a concrete example, blindsight, should we ignore that people report
4623680	4630080	not seeing something that they clearly register because they reach out to it or they move away
4630080	4633920	from it like a ball being thrown at them and they say, I didn't see the ball. Yeah, but they react
4633920	4640320	exactly as they would if they saw the ball. Should we discard their introspective report? No.
4641120	4645200	But we shouldn't take it at face value. So this is what I'm trying to say. I'm not saying that
4645280	4651120	we should discard introspective or subjective reports. What I mean is we should not take them
4651120	4658400	at face value. In blindsight, we understand now that, correct me if I am wrong, Christof, you
4658400	4665200	are the expert here. I'm just a curious reader of the literature. But there is this, there is evidence
4665200	4670960	that there is a back and forth process of communication between two distinct brain areas,
4670960	4676800	and blindsight happens when you interrupt that convergent loop. And that loop may have to do
4676800	4683520	with metacognition. In other words, the person may actually be experiencing vision, but cannot report
4683520	4690000	that experience to itself, to themselves at the metacognitive level. And how can we find that
4690000	4695760	out? Well, through narrow image, detailed narrow imaging. So I think we should take the introspective
4695760	4702880	reports, but couple them with something objective, and not take all the subjective reports just at
4702880	4707360	face value. Otherwise, there would be no such a thing as blindsight. We wouldn't have understood
4707360	4712480	it, at least not to the same extent we understand it today, because we would just, we just say,
4712480	4718080	okay, this person experiences no vision. Well, in fact, they do, they're just not metacognizant of
4718080	4724000	it. Well, I mean, a different interpretation of this is that it doesn't involve cortical pathway,
4724000	4729360	that the information goes from the retina, not necessarily into the solemn was partly because
4729360	4735440	of these people, of course, you know, well, yeah, or down into the brainstem. So, so blindsight
4735440	4740160	typically is not highly sophisticated. There's no evidence really that you can read, for example,
4740160	4744560	a text like this, you know, and saying, Well, I didn't read it, but you can actually read the title.
4745120	4749360	The evidence typically there's an empty field, and there's a bright door, or there's coming
4749600	4754640	something at you. So this character suggests it's something relatively robust and stereotyped
4754640	4759840	that might involve brainstem mechanisms. And yes, those brainstem mechanisms,
4761040	4767920	you know, can lead to response. But they are not associated with consciousness. That would be my
4767920	4776080	interpretation of the current data rather than invoking higher order, because in many, again,
4776080	4780960	mystical states or in some psychedelic states, when you're highly conscious, there is no self,
4780960	4786320	but you're highly, highly conscious of it. So I don't think you need this higher order consciousness.
4786320	4792000	It's there, particularly in adults, literally adults, but I think you can be highly conscious
4792000	4798480	without having this, this metacognition. I offer you just a hypothesis. I'm not a neuroscientist,
4798800	4806720	probably make a fool of myself. But we act deliberately because of our metacognitive
4806720	4815680	processes, we form plans and intentions. If you don't metacognize a sensory experience,
4816240	4821120	you are not going to form intentions around it. In other words, you're not going to form the
4821120	4828400	intention to read the words in a book from left to right. And therefore, none of those
4828400	4832320	blind sight type experiences will be sophisticated because you can't form
4832320	4836960	metacognitive intentions around them. Yeah, but look, but you can perfectly well,
4836960	4841440	so you don't have blind sight, I assume. And if I do this right in front of you,
4841440	4846320	you're going to flinch or your pupil, you know, it's a it's a reflex and you'll perfectly well
4846320	4850320	see it. It'll take you time to see it. In fact, you can show by the time you've seen it,
4850320	4855920	you've already initiated the reflex, but you will see it. So blind sight is only in these
4855920	4861360	patients. It's a very rare phenomenon. It's not very common. And in patients who have lost
4861360	4869120	pieces of the brain, typically in visual cortex. So you and I, you will, you know,
4869120	4874960	if there's an empty screen as a bright dot, you take a blind sight person that has lost
4875440	4880320	V1 and then they claim no, they don't see anything yet. They can still point at it.
4880320	4884320	I don't think it requires something very sophisticated. I think it's just it's a
4884320	4890160	simple visual computation. In this case, it is a computation that doesn't give rise to neural
4890160	4895520	correlate of consciousness. But there is blind sight, even if you have lost V1. Well, that's
4895520	4900080	where it was first reported. It was first reported in it. First, it came out of the
4900080	4904240	annual literature, particularly in monkey, when they remove primary visual cortex,
4904240	4908560	sometimes including higher order, there's a famous monkey called Helen. And there's this
4908560	4914560	video of Helen. This experiment was done by Larry Weisskine's, where you put raisins in front of
4914560	4918880	her. And although she has no primary visual cortex, so for the audience, that's a that's a
4918880	4923360	bit that the visual cortex is the back of your head. Here you can feel, you know, there's this
4923360	4928640	little bump here. That's where visual cortex is. So if you fall backwards, typically you see stars
4928640	4934960	because the mechanical stimulus is translated into nervous energy. So if you remove that in
4934960	4940160	these monkeys, what was so striking that these monkeys could still catch little raisins, you know,
4941040	4946320	it, it looked like they could see perfectly well, but their visual cortex that had been removed,
4946320	4952160	how's that possible? That's how the blind sight was discovered. Because then it was tested in
4952160	4958880	some patients who to say, I don't see anything yet, they can do simple types of visual behavior.
4958880	4963520	As I said, they can't read, but they can do pointing, they can do some color discrimination,
4963520	4968800	etc. So the general assumption is, it involves neurons in the retina that don't go to call to
4968800	4977680	the LGN and cortex, because that part is destroyed, but go to, to, to centers in the brainstem that
4977760	4982480	can mediate things like reflexes or pointing like the coliculus where things are, but they're not
4982480	4989040	associated with consciousness. They do not, they do not provide a substrate for conscious experience.
4989840	4995120	As an idealist, of course, I'm committed to the notion that however it works, it's an experiential
4995120	5000400	process of course, but I'm open to the possibility that it's not an experiential process that is
5000400	5005120	subsumed in the main complex, which I think is what you're trying to say. It's not part of the
5005120	5011760	ego. It's not part of our personal experiential life. It's something off to the side. I'm open to
5011760	5017520	that. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, this might explain all sorts of unconscious, you know, what people
5017520	5023280	explain with the Freudian unconsciousness, that they're, as you said before, dissociation
5023280	5029200	in normal people, like you and I. So there could well be the footprints of my, what
5029920	5037360	I teach calls a complex that includes most of my, my cortex, including Borca's area. So I can
5037360	5042720	talk to you. That's my egodic consciousness. There may still be smaller complexes, let's say in the
5042720	5049760	frontal, inferior frontal or in the back of it, that can, that can possibly control, you know,
5049760	5054640	that get visual input and do stuff that allows me to rapidly run and weave my way through a very
5054640	5060480	busy street. I was sharp as yet the egodic consciousness isn't conscious of it, but it
5060480	5067920	may well be there's this little substrate. The Freudian slips, right? Exactly. So in this case,
5067920	5073200	it wouldn't be unconscious. There would be consciousness, but not the one, the one that
5073200	5078640	controls your Borca's area that you can ask to what, why did you just say that conscious
5079600	5085280	literally might not have no idea. I don't know. I just said it. I have no idea why, because and
5085280	5091840	again, you see this in split brain early on, when you can get this, what's called intermanual conflict.
5091840	5098320	So once you do this, you cut the brain in two in these patients, you can see that typically,
5098320	5103280	for example, a patient will close his shirt with one hand and the other hand will open it,
5103280	5108160	or you get the alien hand syndrome, where the hand will suddenly do something like grab their legs
5108160	5113360	or grab their genitals, and the patient himself completely confuses, I don't know, my hand does
5113360	5118560	this. And the question is, why does it do it? Is it because it's, it also has this consciousness,
5118560	5125040	but not them, but its footprint is not the main one, the egodic consciousness. It's a very interesting
5125040	5132240	hypothesis worth pursuing. Yep. The IIT and Association, that's, that's the future if you ask
5132320	5139600	me. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I've been waiting for a while. Yeah. Shall we move on to
5139600	5145920	another one? Prakash, did you have any more questions to follow up? I want to thank both of
5145920	5152320	them for this very in depth discussion. The only, the only, you know, the thing that I'm pointing
5152320	5158880	out is not to mix the science and metaphysics, but in terms of inquiry, is there a place of
5158880	5164000	convergence where people from these different thought worlds can merge, you know, well, like
5164000	5168800	we have done in this particular group, we've done this. Yeah, we're doing it now, Prakash. Yeah.
5169360	5174720	Yes, I'm just wondering if a physical location might be something like a future university, you
5174720	5181920	know. Yeah, once, for instance, there's a Tibet emery in Science Encounter organized by a party
5181920	5188320	was together with this holiness, the Dalai Lama, I've been there, and I've gone to, to Mungot in
5188320	5192960	India several times where you have Tibetan monasteries, where, where at least you're trying to
5192960	5199200	precisely do this sort of take Western science, typically physics, and neuroscience psychology,
5199200	5204560	and bring it to the monastic community, where each, where each of those two very different
5205120	5213360	traditions and communities can bring, can learn from each other. So I know that there are initiatives
5213360	5221520	like that. Thank you. Thank you. As you guys have already mentioned that our experiment you're
5221520	5229760	being performed. Let's do interesting states. One is general anesthesia. And those cases who
5230720	5238720	were patients who are almost in the dead bed, who were about to die, but somehow
5240000	5247600	happens to be brain dead, and somehow resuscitates facts, and then reports, which we call the NDE.
5248240	5254160	But anyway, so my question is this, both of you see some prospects, which,
5255040	5263520	when I say data means hard data, challenges the conventional understanding in the neuroscience,
5263520	5270560	which exists today, which challenges it. So do you guys see that, do you guys feel that more such
5270560	5277840	experiments are required to take place? And if so, do you guys see maybe currently which is there,
5277840	5282960	or maybe in the future, we can find some more hard data regarding which can challenge the existing
5282960	5290400	conventional understanding of consciousness? All right, near death experience. So that's a very
5290400	5295920	difficult question. So in fact, when I visited Bernardo a couple of months ago, he took me and
5295920	5303440	introduced me to Von Lommel, the Dutch cardiologist, who published this famous study of near death
5303440	5310160	experiences in cardiac, a prospective study in cardiac patients in Holland and reported that 10
5311120	5318640	up to 15% of these people had near death experiences. So I think, so at least in Bernardo,
5318640	5325040	I know we differ here, and then let me give my position and then over to you. So there's the
5325040	5329040	interesting psychological phenomenon of near death experiences, which is very powerful,
5329840	5334880	which is highly reproducible, and people are taking serious, in a sense, it's being studied by many
5334880	5339360	people, psychologists, neuroscientists, where you know, you lose your sense of self, you lose your
5341920	5348640	body. In my case, I had one of these, there was nothing there, just light. So typically, people
5348640	5357760	report either this lucidity or this very, very icy blue, blue, bright or light of overwhelming
5357760	5364320	intensity, and then some combination of terror or ecstasy or certain other experiences. So they're
5364400	5370800	now conferences organized, book being written about NDE, where it gets, so that used to be very
5370800	5376400	controversial, and the only place where you could find these stories in the bookstore was under
5376400	5380960	Isotirica, you know, way in the back of the bookstore, where they have stuff on a magic and
5380960	5387120	witchcraft, you can find stories on NDE. That's changed, that's now mainstream. What remains
5387200	5394960	highly, highly controversial is the claim, and it's very difficult to really test rigorously,
5394960	5400960	and I'll tell you why. What's the brain doing this experience? What's the brain actually dead?
5401600	5406880	So a death is a complicated matter now, you know, it used to be very easy. You were dead when your
5406880	5410480	brain stopped, when you stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, but now with
5410560	5416320	resuscitation tools and with extracorporeal, you know, heart lung, it becomes much more difficult
5416320	5422000	to define what death is and how you define it, and typically one way to define it would be
5422000	5428240	isoelectric EEG, but of course in the vast number of cases in the ICU where these people
5428240	5433120	with cardiac arrest are treated, you don't have a high density EEG, and you don't have the luxury
5433120	5438800	to put on a high density EEG while the patient is cold blue, right, or cold red, right, because
5438880	5443440	the heart stopped, because every seconds count, so you're not going to put electrode on them.
5443440	5449040	So that claim, so on the one hand there are people like Von Lommel who really says the brain
5449040	5455280	was dead, i.e. in this case functionally inactive, no more electrical activity, no more electrical
5455280	5462480	activity, really flat line, what's called when the EEG is flat line. I find that, I just find
5462480	5467760	that impossible to accept having studied the brain for 40 years and knowing the close relationship
5467760	5473120	between electrical activity and different brain states, like sleep, like dreaming, like regular,
5473120	5479920	we can see it in babies, in newborns, in disease, etc. I find that very, very difficult to accept,
5479920	5487120	but there are persons now over to Bernardo, including Von Lommel, who really insist people
5487120	5493200	can have these experiences while their brain is totally inactive. Bernardo.
5493200	5500960	Yeah, I think Ben Von Lommel's study on the Lansent in 2001 was methodologically
5500960	5507520	strong. I take it seriously, I take MD years seriously, for instance, I think even Alexander,
5507520	5515600	even Alexander III, Anita Morjani and others are truthfully reporting what they experienced.
5516400	5524560	Observe, however, that neither Morjani nor Eben were flat line during their NDEs.
5526000	5532640	The claim there is that the experiential complexity, the structural complexity
5532640	5541200	of their experiences was incompatible with anatomical damage and vastly diminished
5541280	5554240	metabolism or disrupted metabolism. For me, it's not so important whether NDEs
5555360	5559920	flat out contradict physicalism or not, because there was an experience that happened
5560480	5564640	when you could not have had any brain activity whatsoever. For me, this is highly
5565440	5570640	unimportant, because I think we don't need it to contradict physicalism.
5570640	5576640	I think physicalism is a non-starter. We are giving it too much if we acknowledge that we
5576640	5585920	need to prove that in order to prove physicalism false. I think it is inevitable that experience
5585920	5592880	never ends. The question is, is that an experience that correlates with ego itself? Can there be
5592960	5596080	an egoic self-experience when there is zero metabolism?
5596880	5602480	Maybe not. Maybe yes. Either way, I'm happy my analytic idealist stance.
5604240	5611200	What I don't think, and here is where I depart from my friends in the NDE world, and Christoph
5611200	5618400	and I discussed this at length, there is a lot of emphasis in the NDE community on so-called
5618400	5626240	veridical experiences. Things that you saw that were not correlated with the physical location
5626240	5630880	of your body, and you couldn't have seen them because your eyes were shut and you had no brain
5630880	5638320	activity or whatever. I don't think what's happening is that we have some kind of gaseous soul
5638320	5643600	that inhabits the body, and then when you have an NDE, the soul sort of leaves the body and goes
5643600	5649760	floating around and can still see and hear and taste and smell. I don't think that is plausible,
5649760	5656320	otherwise nature would be highly redundant. Why did we have to struggle through life and death
5656320	5662160	for four billion years to evolve the sense organs we have if by stopping our heart we can float
5662160	5668800	around seeing and hearing and sensing everything? I don't think that is plausible, yet I do take
5668800	5675440	the veridical reports seriously. I just think that we need a more nuanced way to try to account for
5675440	5684560	them as opposed to just appealing to the simple face value account that I don't think is plausible
5684560	5690240	at all, which is we can see without eyes. I can't pass that through my head, no.
5690720	5698880	That's a claim on the chat saying that some people say during that MDA people actually
5698880	5704320	remember their afterlife as in like previous, previous life. Is there such a case in your data,
5704320	5712000	Dr. Professor Ko? I've never seen convincing evidence of that. I mean, I know people claim
5712080	5721120	that, but I personally am very skeptical. Sceptical about it. Last interview we had with
5721120	5731120	Bernardo and Lee Long and Bernard Carr. Apparently Dalai Lama has actually do a lot of reading on
5731120	5739760	the brainwave or something like that during somebody's death. He's interested in your sign
5739760	5745760	specifically, yes. So you don't think that those kind of data are reliable at all?
5747040	5752080	I don't know. I mean, I know people claim, but people claim all sorts of things that obviously
5752080	5758480	didn't happen. I just don't know how that would work. So I just had a discussion, in fact, in India,
5758480	5763600	in Mungot, with the Sholina Sadali Lama, and we were talking about reincarnation, and I said,
5764000	5770560	and permit me, I'm just a naive physical, at the time I was a naive physicalist. I said, well,
5771600	5777440	forwards, no brain, never mind. So in other words, there has to be some sort of substrate,
5778320	5785440	some sort of substrate. It may be something very strange, very unconventional, quantum, nano,
5785440	5794320	whatever you want. But without a substrate, I don't see, so this is at least a substrate that
5794320	5802000	can be manipulated, and that can be operationalized using measure like transition probability.
5802000	5807280	In the absence of anything like that, I don't see how mine could occur. So I don't see how previous
5807280	5816400	life, where would their memory be stored, as it were? I remain unconvinced. I don't know whether
5816400	5824080	you want to say something, Bernardo. Yeah, I do. We shouldn't agree on everything here today.
5826800	5835200	I'll try to disagree. Look, I was talking about Ibn's NDE, Ibn Alexander. He was not flatlined.
5835200	5842320	His claim is that the state, the anatomical and physiological state of his nervous system was
5842320	5848400	not compatible with the richness, sophistication, and intensity of the experiences he had. I take
5848400	5854240	that seriously. I think that is a plausible statement to make. How would I account for that?
5854240	5861280	Well, I think no more metabolism is the image not only of our internal experiential states,
5861280	5867440	but also the dissociation mechanism itself, this actively enforced dissociation mechanism.
5868000	5874240	So certain metabolic conditions, some impairments of metabolism are probably the appearance of an
5874240	5880400	impairment of that dissociative boundary itself. So I think it is plausible that in those states
5880400	5886720	in which your dissociative boundary, normally actively enforced, is impaired, that you will
5886720	5893200	pick up on experiential states in your cognitive neighborhood that do not correlate with the
5893200	5897520	way you appear on the dashboard. In other words, do not correlate with the body form,
5897520	5904400	with metabolism and anatomy. Because I think of the body as an image of experiential states,
5904400	5910320	as opposed to the cause of experiential states. I'm open to the possibility that the image is
5910320	5916560	incomplete. It doesn't say everything there is to say about the experiential states it correlates with.
5916560	5920880	For instance, I, from your perspective, I am an image on your computer screen.
5922480	5927120	The pixels on your computer screen arrange themselves in such a way as to correlate
5927120	5933440	with my inner life. Because I'm speaking, I'm expressing my inner life, and it appears as a
5933440	5938880	representation on your screen. But that representation doesn't say everything there is to say about my
5938880	5946400	inner life. It is an incomplete image. So I take it seriously that the body can be also an incomplete
5946400	5951360	image. It may not correlate with everything there is to correlate when it comes to memories,
5951360	5956720	or when it comes to certain experiential states that we call transcendent or transformative.
5956720	5961600	Those may have to do with dissociative boundary that becomes porous. And you're just
5961600	5966560	trafficking with the cognitive surroundings around you. And those will not correlate
5966560	5971280	with your body form. So I think evens claim is plausible. Anita's claim is plausible.
5972160	5979440	But when it comes to reincarnation, at least in the cartoonish form that we tend to explain it,
5979440	5986320	which is that your personal agency somehow survives the complete dissipation of the image
5986320	5993360	that in all other cases correlates with it, and somehow enters or associates itself with another
5993360	6000560	body, I think this isn't plausible. Because our personal agency correlates extraordinarily well
6000640	6005600	with the body image. If the body image is not there, I think we should grant that at least
6005600	6013120	a lot if not the complete personal agency is no longer the case. So I don't think
6013120	6021840	our personal agency hops from body to body. Otherwise, I would expect children to already
6021840	6025680	be born knowing everything they knew in the previous life. And then people say, well, we
6025680	6033440	forget things. Yes, but there are certain things, you know, do we forget riding a bike or swimming?
6033440	6040480	And I don't know, I don't see a coherent way to account for the hypothesis of the survival
6040480	6047360	of personal agency. So I don't think it happens. But what people report and we interpret as
6047360	6053840	reincarnation, what they actually report is someone else's memories. Could they be somehow
6054400	6063040	finding a cognitive path across a dissociative boundary and link to a memory state that is out
6063040	6067840	there in our cognitive neighborhood, because its previous owner has died, it doesn't have a
6067840	6073040	dissociative boundary anymore. So its memories are released out there and they get picked up by new
6073040	6080880	emerging dissociative processes. Perhaps I think that is plausible and it will remain plausible
6080880	6087760	until and unless we find exactly what in the physical world correlates to memories,
6087760	6094320	not to the recall of memories, but to memories as a repository of information. And seeing the
6094320	6099680	work that has been done recently, we are not getting closer to it. We seem to be all over the
6099680	6106000	place. So until and unless we pin that down, I think it is plausible that experiential states
6106000	6113200	corresponding to a dead person's memories get picked up by a newly emerging dissociated
6113200	6120880	complex in this field of subjectivity that nature is. So if we let's say we take Michael Levin's
6120880	6127200	bioelectrical signal, so how do that's bioelectric signal carrying memory then? Because
6127200	6133040	there all seems to have a memory that would still be physical. Yeah, it would still be physical.
6133040	6136640	It's a field, an electric field, you can measure it at a particular frequency.
6136640	6142800	So that still requires a physical substrate. My point is simply in the absence of any such
6142800	6147360	a physical substrate, I don't see how you could preserve memory or agency or anything else.
6148240	6153680	And to encode rich information in a field, you need some form of modulation signaling some
6153680	6157680	stuff that we would be able to read out and see and say, okay, that's the information,
6157680	6164080	that's where it's coming from, we can see it in the behavior of the field. And what Michael sees,
6165200	6169200	he's not trying to account for reincarnation. So let's start from that.
6174960	6181760	What he realizes is that the body plan is related to bioelectric fields.
6182480	6189280	And you can coax a cancer cell back to the body plan by manipulating the bioelectric field.
6189280	6196400	I think this is... Intranaria. No, no, in frogs. Frogs. And in frogs and in salamander.
6196400	6203440	Yeah. Yeah. Not yet in mammals. Yeah, no, it's cool stuff. It is. It is. It's interesting stuff. Yeah,
6203440	6209600	no question. So basically, what I want to say is that like, you know, you should not bring back
6209600	6214160	the materialism from the back end, saying that there's a substrate. What we can instead say
6214160	6218320	everything is abstract, you know, because the numbers, for example, are abstract, software
6218320	6223280	programs are abstract. We all understand that they're not anywhere, but they're accessible to us
6223280	6227360	because there is a structure and so on. Now, the point is like, you know, that
6228320	6233280	how it is proven is that when we see something, it's actually in the visual cortex where they
6233280	6238080	know life. And yet we have all the perception, which is happening right now, which obviously
6238080	6242400	means like, you know, that it's only because of nervous signals, if the perception is happening.
6242400	6247680	But nervous signals have nothing in them to cause the so-called perception because the signals
6247680	6253520	are signals. They're just moving around. It's electricity moving around. So the perceptive field
6253520	6259120	is a totally independent of the abstract realities, because now rest of the reality,
6259120	6263600	now we have to say abstract because the perception is connected to the abstract realities.
6263680	6267360	Now, if you take this viewpoint, then body is just a cache of information,
6267360	6271840	like a computer. And it's not even physical. It's just an abstract boundary. It has an abstract
6271840	6278160	boundaries. And it's doing all the manipulation. So in this viewpoint, all the inconsistencies of
6278160	6282880	the theories are stored is what I feel. But only thing you have to admit is that the so-called
6282880	6287840	senses are not physical in nature. They are like the standalone. They're a different category by
6287840	6292960	themselves. They're not physical in nature. They're not objects in nature. And then the so-called
6292960	6300160	awareness, which is what we feel is having access to infinite amount of memory. But when it is
6300160	6304960	actually practical, it's only having boundaries of information. Like our body is a boundary.
6304960	6310240	When we study computer science, it's a boundary of information. And by creating a boundary,
6310240	6314800	we are able to work in a consistent manner because without a boundary, there cannot be
6314800	6320400	consistency in the reality. And the consciousness, one of the property of consciousness is to
6320400	6324640	manipulate the boundaries of information. That's why we are able to say that, like, you know,
6324640	6328800	we are talking to each other in clubhouse, that's a boundary. And we can now increase and say,
6328800	6334000	okay, I'm in the physical reality, and so on and so on. Because no physical system can manage its
6334000	6340320	own knowledge boundary, not even the LLMs, right? It's only the awareness or consciousness,
6340320	6345680	which changes the knowledge boundaries, which it manipulates, which it then superimpose on the
6345680	6350400	body. And then it translates into nervous signals, which then do the all the work, which is all just
6350400	6355280	a layered system, the way we do the layering of the information in the computer. I feel
6356400	6359840	this is how it has to be adopted, because it's actually Vedantic view, what I'm telling is kind
6359840	6366560	of Vedantic view. Do you have a questions, Vinod, to Professor Cole? I'm saying that we should not
6366560	6373440	bring materialism in any way when we are talking about the models of reality is what my point is.
6373440	6382000	Thank you. Is it acceptable or what is? Accepting, at least, I mean, manipulating
6383280	6390160	known mechanisms that we see, whether it's in the brain, or in the outside world, in
6391280	6396880	geology, or in physics, or in solid state physics, or in quantum mechanics has been enormously
6397840	6403760	as successful. If we want techniques that in a lawful way manipulate our environment,
6404960	6410720	and then use them to build technology, accepting that they are mechanisms has been incredible
6410720	6417200	useful. That has been the right time of science for better words. And I see no reason we can't,
6417200	6424880	we can't continue to do that. We just should deemphasize whether there truly exist in some
6424880	6431760	absolute sense and whether there's something ultimately underneath that.
6433120	6439760	But science, all of science and the modern way of life is conditioned on manipulating
6439760	6445040	mechanisms in a particular state. And that works, whether that's brains, or whether that's
6445040	6451600	nuclear reactors, it works exceedingly well. I mean, the mRNA COVID has given out a proof of
6451600	6457920	that that rational understanding of mechanisms really gave rise to this, to this highly, you know,
6458880	6465120	protective medicine. And that's what science can do. Just in defense of that.
6465680	6469920	Simple question. If we move our hand, what really is the mechanism at place? Where is the starting
6469920	6474960	point of movement of hands? That's what I'm asking is the problem is not about how to
6474960	6479040	move reality, how to change reality. What is the source of change of reality?
6480000	6485520	Yeah, so IIT has a very precise answer to that. Ultimately, it totally agrees with your intuition.
6485520	6490800	It's not the neurons that move my hand. It's not the muscles that move my hand, but it's ultimately
6490800	6495280	the intrinsic causal power of my conscious experience to make a point. And then to make
6495280	6501440	that point, I raise my left hand or raise my right hand. So the conventional explanation is
6501440	6505680	it's my premotor cortex that gave rise to the readiness potential and libid experiments and
6505680	6510480	all of that. But within IIT says, no, it's not the underlying neurons that cause it. It's my
6510480	6516880	conscious experience that was the ultimate cause that however that does correlate with
6516880	6522560	certain brain phenomena. But then as we always teach our students correlation is not causation.
6522560	6527920	So just because you can read off a brain signal a second before you actually make the movement
6527920	6533920	doesn't mean that this brain signal is the actual cause of it. So I would tend to agree with your
6533920	6540560	point of view. Yeah, of course, I agree too. I think where the confusion comes, it's more a
6540560	6552400	psychodynamic whole thing. When we understood back in the early 17th century that two perspectives
6552400	6556880	were very useful and conducive to the production of knowledge and understanding nature, those
6556880	6565520	perspectives were realism and naturalism. When we understood that realism and naturalism came
6565520	6574000	back under the metaphysics of physicalism. But that was just the one example of naturalism
6574000	6580400	and realism that we had. Naturalism and realism are not intrinsically associated with physicalism.
6580400	6586560	You can abandon physicalism without having to abandon realism and naturalism. In other words,
6586640	6592720	without having to abandon the notion that there is a world out there made of states that are
6592720	6598480	outside my personal agency and which I cannot control or change merely by an act of volition.
6598480	6606000	And those states obey certain regularities, certain natural regularities such as expressed in the
6606000	6613760	chains of causation. Those states do not do what they do because there is an entity outside nature
6613760	6619040	that is intervening into nature all the time and making things move around, moving the planets
6619040	6623600	around the orbit of the sun like the flying spaghetti monster with its noodley appendages.
6624880	6631680	That's what we deny. We deny that there is deliberate intervention to explain the dynamics of
6631680	6636720	nature. We say under naturalism that nature does what it does because it is what it is. And to be
6636720	6642000	is to have properties and because nature has the properties it has, it behaves in the way it does.
6642000	6647360	That's naturalism and there is a world out there that's realism. We can preserve both
6647360	6653360	while discarding physicalism which makes an extra claim which is that the external states of the
6653360	6659920	world out there are not experiential fundamentally and it is only the arrangement of those states
6659920	6665760	that in certain circumstances generate experience as something epiphenomenal and they don't have
6666080	6673920	an account for how that miracle could possibly happen. So we reject that but in doing it we
6673920	6679440	do not need to reject naturalism and realism. Or just talk about the nervous system as it relates
6679440	6685360	to IIT. All right, nervous system relates to IIT. I think it means the rest of the peripheral nervous
6685360	6693840	system below the brain stem. I think that's the question. Does it correlate with experiential
6693840	6700240	states, the rest of the nervous system? Yeah. Okay, so the brain conventionally is sort of the
6700240	6704640	central nervous system but as Bernardo said there's of course a peripheral nervous system
6704640	6711280	that goes all the way into almost all that innervates our muscles of course but that also
6711280	6719120	innervates our heart, our kidneys, our liver, our gut, our sexual organs. So all of that and it's
6719120	6724160	bi-directional. It goes the information travels from the periphery from these organs into the brain
6724160	6733040	and from the brain back into the organ and so but the actual substrate of consciousness is probably
6733040	6738720	in the upper part in the upper echelon at least in normal people who grew up with a normal brain
6738720	6744320	it's probably in cortex. It doesn't include the PNS, the peripheral nervous system. However,
6744320	6748800	you can perfectly well be aware of these states of the peripheral nervous system. You can feel
6748880	6753840	hungry, you can feel you know when you have a full belly, you can feel you know when you need to go
6753840	6758880	to the bathroom, you can feel if you're training yourself and pay attention you can be sensitive
6758880	6765840	to your heartbeat right and snipers can learn to do that so you can perfectly well become aware of
6765840	6771040	these states and furthermore what what the placebo and the nocebo response shows that
6771920	6778240	that your narrative, your belief can reach out all the way what you believe in your mind
6778240	6785520	about something some procedure or some ceremony or some person can reach all the way back using
6785520	6793920	those those axons but now going backwards into the organs and can influence your immune system,
6793920	6799440	can influence your gut right in psychology this is also called the somatization when people
6799440	6804880	have various symptoms but they show up in various parts of their of their body so it's really a
6804880	6809680	two-way communication and and what we've learned over the last hundred years there can be this
6809680	6816640	profound influence on your belief since ultimately that's what's known as a placebo or the it's dark
6816640	6823120	twin the nocebo response that's exactly what it shows when you believe that a particular piece of
6823120	6828800	pill subscribed to you by somebody who spent 10 years at a medical school it's called doctor
6828800	6834560	in a white lab coat and you've read all about those other people who with that same pill have
6834560	6839440	these wonderful experiences then you too will believe and then you too are much more likely
6840240	6850240	to have such an experience or to have an amelioration of your symptoms so this shows
6850240	6854560	prime sort of mind over matter so I think it's a very important lessons to take home
6855440	6862560	and it all requires the two-way communication that is the peripheral nervous system thank you
6862560	6867680	hey guys so I was listening to you know the arguments against personal agency
6867680	6874080	and reincarnation and my question is if the argument is made as the personal agency having
6874080	6878960	the body and not the body having the personal agency do you see do you see that there is a
6878960	6885760	change of standpoint that you are having and a follow-up question can be you know even in
6885760	6890640	certain idealist philosophies like Mahayana Buddhism that personal agency is considered
6890640	6896400	to be part of physicalism so do you see that possibility as well in your arguments I mean
6897520	6903280	I don't see how without I mean once again without a substrate without that being some
6903280	6912640	substrate I don't see how personal memories or personal agency can can be we need some substrate
6912640	6919680	without that I don't see how that would happen and if for sophisticated minds like yours and mine
6919680	6924800	you need a very sophisticated substrate that that potentially can adopt many many many different
6924800	6933200	states in the absence of that I don't see you know nothing nothing comes talking from principle
6934080	6939440	I'm a little bit less strict than Christoph because of this view I have that images do not
6939440	6947440	need to be complete the hypothesis is not incoherent in principle there could be a hierarchy of
6947440	6954400	dissociation in nature such that higher level dissociative process that you call then the
6954400	6962000	personal agency would further dissociate into what appears to us as a physical body and when
6962000	6967840	that under that that's a lower level of dissociation comes to an end and the physical body then
6967840	6972880	dissolves because it's the image of that process that is no longer going on you sort of fall back
6972880	6977600	into that higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy and there is still something
6977600	6984240	individuated there that's the hypothesis is it in principle incoherent no does it have empirical
6984240	6992560	backing no and you could say well the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so there
6992560	7000400	could still be this higher level of dissociation that preserves individual agency yes but isn't
7000400	7010160	it quite forced because a lot about the body correlates with our inner mental states so
7010160	7016720	what we are requiring here is that although there is this enormous vast correlation between body
7016720	7022560	and our mental states which we consider individual when it comes to this higher level of dissociation
7022560	7029200	in the hierarchy it doesn't appear at all on the dashboard it has no physical correlate or in the
7029200	7038880	words of Christoph it has no substrate that I think stretches plausibility too much I am open
7038880	7044160	to the idea in principle but I don't think we have sufficient reasons to entertain it quite
7044160	7051120	seriously at this point quickly because yeah it is for professor Christoph and it was regarding
7051120	7058800	that famous bet which you had with David Chalmers so I just wanted to know or it was more of a
7058800	7066320	lighter note but like did you change your quote-unquote position after post that bet or
7067920	7075360	and if you're not so like why a more serious note like what do you see like David Chalmers one
7075360	7084160	and you don't see both IIT and I think a GWT both is not able to answer the question which
7084160	7089280	has been you know the hard problem of consciousness that would be my quick question
7090640	7094240	no so this bet was not about the hard problem it was about the easy problem
7094960	7102320	the bet was in 25 years from 2098 will the community of scientists that study conscience agree
7102880	7109040	it's these mechanisms in that part of the brain that are the substrate of consciousness and no
7109920	7115760	as of last year the community has not agreed on that but he agrees I mean David Chalmers agrees
7115760	7121280	it's a perfectly solvable problem and sooner or later we won't know the answer sooner or later
7121280	7126560	we know that these mechanisms in that state give rise to pain or to pleasure or to seeing and
7126560	7131360	and to reading there's no question about it it's an entirely operational empirical defined
7131360	7137280	defined project and it does not suffer from the hard problem because it's just correlation
7137360	7141920	this part of the brain or these neurons doing this thing correlate with that conscious experience
7143120	7147680	massive thank you for both of you for joining us today thank you so much thank you to see you
7147680	7154720	take care yeah see you all again take care take care see you next Friday all right see you bye bye
