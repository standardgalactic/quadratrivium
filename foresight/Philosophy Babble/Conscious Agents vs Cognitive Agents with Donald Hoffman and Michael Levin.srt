1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
The view in our cognitive scientists today is that we construct our perceptions of reality

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,680
in real time. The question was, could we be misinterpreting the content of our perceptual

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:23,080
experiences? And what is our current understanding in a biology of science? According to evolution,

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,880
what we perceive with our brain and our senses does not reflect the true natures of the reality.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,640
Why should you care? The implications of such radical finding rock the foundations of our

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,440
belief system that space-time is fundamental. In this series, we are delighted to have Professor

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,880
Meredith O'Carnative Science, Donald Hoffman, and Professor of Developmental and Synthetic

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,320
Biology, Michael Levin joining us today to discuss the idea, and we are going to look

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,880
at what is a contest agency. Welcome, Professor Levin. Welcome, Professor Hoffman.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,880
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Absolutely.

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,360
How's the new year treating both professors so far? Did you all have a good holiday?

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,520
Yeah, sure. Yes, healthy and uneventful, which is good. Yeah, nothing to complain about.

13
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,840
So, any new project for 2023?

14
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:39,320
Many things. So, in our lab, we have a variety of kind of conceptual and computational projects

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,400
and also a bunch of bench work and stuff. So, we have lots of things going on in the areas of,

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,240
well, the practicalities come out as cancer, birth defects, regenerative medicine, those kinds of

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,560
things. It is our desire to understand collective intelligence, which I think is all intelligence,

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:08,360
and how it is that minds are sort of emerge in the physical world. And so, we are finding new

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,680
ways to try to communicate with cellular swarms in the body as a kind of collective intelligence.

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,520
And we've got some interesting things on looking at the different competencies of things like

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,520
gene regulatory networks, in addition to other models like slime molds and things. So,

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
yeah, lots of new stuff along those lines.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Busy is going to keep you busy. And Don, you?

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,160
That's quite a list. That's an impressive list. Well, we're focused on a number of projects,

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,640
but most interesting to me is the physicists tell us that space time is doomed. And they're

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,160
not just saying that they're finding new structures beyond space time, right? They're

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,720
actually finding these structures like the Amplituhedron and the deepest structure or something

28
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:06,040
called decorated permutations. But these are just like static structures beyond space time.

29
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:14,360
We've been looking for a dynamics beyond space time, dynamical system that would actually give

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,600
rise to these structures, like the deepest structure is the decorated permutation. So,

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:28,920
we just published a paper last week in which we did that. So, we prove that it's apparently a new

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,640
mathematical result that you can canonically map Markov chains, any Markov chain to decorated

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:44,680
permutations. And so, that gives us a window now to start to interpret these structures beyond

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,240
space time in terms of Markovian dynamics. And so, that's what we're doing now. So, we have

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,880
the project I'm working on now is to show we have a Markovian dynamics of conscious agents.

36
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,120
That's what made us look after these Markov chain ideas and see if we could, you know,

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,360
turn them into decorated permutations. That was the motivation because we already have a Markovian

38
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,360
dynamics of consciousness. And so, that's what we're up to now is, okay, now that we have this map

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,520
of our conscious agent dynamics, so as a model of conscious agents beyond space time into decorated

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:27,640
permutations, that now should instruct us exactly how to port specific properties of the conscious

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,920
agent dynamics to specific physical properties like mass, momentum, spin, and energy and so

42
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:40,840
forth. So, that's what I'm excited to do because that link has told us where exactly to look

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,160
in our conscious agent dynamics. And so, we're looking there and we're finding some beautiful

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,160
mathematical structures and getting hints about how they project to properties in space time. So,

45
00:04:51,160 --> 00:05:00,360
we're trying to, so that's my project to map that out and then make explicit proposals for how

46
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,120
could be tested with the data on the inner structure of protons. So, the scattering

47
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,040
experiments that have been done since the 1960s at Stanford Linear Accelerator and then

48
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,680
much more powerful ones later on. We have given us a tremendous amount of detail about the inner

49
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,440
structure, the quark gluon and so forth structure, the parton structure of, and their momentum

50
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,120
distributions inside protons. So, that's my goal this year is to try to actually predict those

51
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,400
distributions from a theory of conscious agents that's beyond space time. That would be, that would

52
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,400
be a good year. On the 20th of December, Professor Levin tweeted, when I was five, I asked my dad

53
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,960
where a certain toy was that I couldn't find. He said, you know how today's clicks over into

54
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,600
tomorrow while you sleep at night? Well, the toy didn't make it. I wouldn't say that's responsible

55
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,480
for my all weird thinking actions, but I spent a long time thinking about how frame of time and

56
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:13,000
days works. How some object passed from yesterday to today and how that apparently can fail. And

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,040
how we as mine say in yesterday, or successfully make it forward. Try to stay up all night to

58
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,320
catch the transactions very disturbing at the time. Professor Levin, could you speak on the toy

59
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:35,960
that missing? Yeah, I remember it quite clearly. It was a, it was a, it was some sort of plastic

60
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,400
gun or something like this. And, and I remember my, my, I couldn't find it anywhere. And I'm sure,

61
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm sure probably somebody threw it away. And my dad, without skipping a beat, he said, he said,

62
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,080
oh yeah, you know, like at night, when things, you know, go over from today to tomorrow, yeah,

63
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,560
it didn't make it. So, you know, that's it. You can give up. It just didn't make it. And I walked

64
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,680
away thinking, oh my God, that's bad. There's a thought like, like, what, well, what determines

65
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,760
whether things make it? And, and, and what if I don't make it? And, and, and what happens? And

66
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,480
then I tried to stay up, of course, all night wanting to catch that, you know, wanting to catch

67
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,200
that moment. When I wasn't, I wasn't able to, I would just fall asleep somewhere around midnight

68
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,160
and like, dang, I missed it again. But you know, so I don't know how much, how much that was responsible

69
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,920
for some of the strange things I think about. But I do, I do think that one of the things that

70
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,400
I've been thinking about recently is this, which I think it relates that is this notion of a lot

71
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,800
of what we do relates to this notion of selfhood or being a self, you know, what does it mean to be

72
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,640
a permanent or, or not, not a permanent, but a stable cognitive structure? Because much like with

73
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,280
bodies, which are a kind of ship of thesis sort of thing, right, molecules come and go all the

74
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,560
time cells come and go all the time. But something stays the same. So what is that? And what are the

75
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,680
policies that the other cells and molecules are implementing that allows some sort of stable,

76
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,880
large scale collective to remain while the low level parts are swapped out at will. And it's not

77
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,040
always a policy to maintain status quo, it might be more metamorphosis, it might be all kinds of

78
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,680
changes that, you know, regeneration and development may, but, but in any case, you need to maintain

79
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,320
some sort of large scale coherence, even though the parts are changing out all the time. So I was

80
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,200
thinking about this with respect to the cognition as well, if you're going to be a stable mind of

81
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,560
some sort, you need to allow ID and go and you need to be in different states. But it, it can't

82
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,240
be something that just completely erases you, you know, every time you have a new thought, well,

83
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,840
that's it, now you're, you know, now you're gone. So, so, so that that balance with the opposite

84
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,840
idea, which comes from many places, but among them, Buddhist ideas of an impermanent self,

85
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,760
or perhaps an illusory, even, even maybe an illusory self. So I've been, I've been thinking about

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,480
that a lot and trying to play with these ideas of stability, but, but changeability and the

87
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:08,680
robustness and yet plasticity. And one way I now think about this is that the self is, it's not

88
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,680
so much that it's completely illusory, but it, but it has to be recreated at every moment in time.

89
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,760
And what I mean by that is just that, at any given moment right now, everything you know about,

90
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,240
or you think you know about yourself, your past, everything else, you have to reconstruct

91
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,440
from the memory traces in your brain. You don't actually have access to anything that really

92
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,880
happened before, whether they be molecules or, or physiological structures, we actually don't

93
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,320
know what it is really. But whatever it is that you've got hold of right now, you have this narrow

94
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,760
slice of now, which is, I don't know, a couple of hundred milliseconds, maybe, and that's your

95
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,720
self. And then you sort of have to reconstruct everything you think you know, from whatever

96
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,040
memory molecules or, you know, engrams that you find laying around in your, in your brain. That's

97
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,920
your only, and of course, people have played with this, you know, for these sort of, I think,

98
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,240
I think maybe humor, somebody said, you know, or, or Boltzmann brains, you know, this idea that

99
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,480
all your memories could have been created and the really hadn't been, and I don't mean, I don't mean

100
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,480
this, this, this sort of bizarre sceptical thing that can't be disproven. I just mean literally

101
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:24,120
that at every moment, as a cognitive agent, you have to be constructing a model of yourself from

102
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,960
the evidence that you have, which and where does it come from? Well, whatever engrams happen to be

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,920
in your, in your, in your brain. And so this, you know, you can imagine yourself as these like

104
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,720
slices in this, in this, you know, and I'm sure I'm sure this is, you know, as Don was saying,

105
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,120
this probably an outdated view already, but I sort of imagine it as these slices of this, of this

106
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,520
giant space time loaf, so to speak. And each, and each one you're basically, you have to recreate

107
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:58,040
yourself from scratch. And, and then, and if, and that way, what happens is that you can think of

108
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,400
everything you've done in the past and all the memories that were formed in the past,

109
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,200
patients from a past self to a future self, and everything you're doing now are messages that

110
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,320
you are in fact leaving for your future self in a way, right? Because so the memories that you're

111
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,080
forming now and the things you're doing now are things that some future version of you is going

112
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,880
to be using those to base their model of what the heck is going on and when, and who am I? And,

113
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,280
and of course, there are medical versions of this. So people with anterior grade amnesia,

114
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,080
who can't form new memories, what do they do? They, they, they leave, right? So, so, so you

115
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,920
wake up in the morning, because there's this notepad. And on the notepad, first thing it says is,

116
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, by the way, you've got anterior grade amnesia. This is who you are. And this is what's going on.

117
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,320
And the last thing is, don't forget to, don't forget to write. And so we all do this all the

118
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,320
time. It's just that typically our pads are internal. So that, right? So that's all that is

119
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,040
really the same problem, because you must reconstruct yourself. It's just on a smaller

120
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,680
scale. And, and it's somehow internal. So anyway, that's, that's my, my ramblings on that. That,

121
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:06,360
that's how I've been thinking about this. Thank you. Don, what did you think the time is then?

122
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,520
Is it a, is it a, you know, space and time? Is it more like a data structure?

123
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,280
Could you speak on that, please? Great question. I'll just say one thing along the lines of what

124
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,880
Mike was saying. I agree with what you're saying, Mike. And it's, and it's quite interesting,

125
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:31,240
because every time you access those memories, you destroy them. You have to do memory reconciled.

126
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,760
You have to actually rebuild the memories all the time as well. So, so you're rebuilding yourself

127
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,440
all the time. It's not like the memory is there and it's always there. You know, every time you

128
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,720
access it, you have to rebuild it. So that's distracting. And yeah, the framework in which

129
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,520
you're talking like, you know, the space time loaf is, has been the standard, your physicalist

130
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:57,480
framework, you know, since, since Einstein for, so for over a century now. And, but it's interesting

131
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,880
how the physicists realized that, that, that space time itself isn't, is not fundamental.

132
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,480
And so, so it doesn't mean that those ideas are wrong. It means that that way of thinking about

133
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,520
them will have to be understood at a deeper level, right? We'll have to have a deeper representation

134
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:19,240
beyond space time and that, you know, of physics or whatever beyond space time that projects down

135
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,360
to the space time loaf and projects down to the processes we see, like memory, reconciliation,

136
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,840
and so forth, the middle processes. So those, so, so the space and time are not fundamental,

137
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,960
you know, then, and the physicists are, the physicists are the ones who are not me. It's

138
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:42,680
the physicists that are saying space time is doomed. It, their own theories. So quantum field

139
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,080
theory and general relativity together are very clear that it's a data structure that works down

140
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:55,560
to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and then falls apart. So it's actually a really shallow

141
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,040
data structure. It's 10 to the minus 33, not 10 to the minus 33 trillion,

142
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:07,160
just 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, the thing falls apart. And so, so that means that, by the

143
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:15,560
way, time also falls apart at 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So, so I take the physicists up their

144
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,200
word that space time is doomed. And that that means that time is doomed. Right. So your question

145
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:31,240
was about time. So, so we, and that also, by the way, means that ultimately, the strategy in science

146
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:41,640
of that, if you go to smaller and smaller scales of space time, you find more and more fundamental

147
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:47,080
objects and more and more fundamental laws. That's the reductionism. That's precisely the

148
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,360
reductionism I mean. That reductionism is false. It just doesn't work beyond 10 to the minus 33

149
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,520
centimeters. And in fact, it falls apart well before them. You get these UVIR correspondences

150
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:11,800
that will things up well before that. So, so I think that time is and space are merely interface

151
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:19,080
concepts that they're, they're what we use to get by in, but they're not the reality and the,

152
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,840
and the reality is something entirely outside space and time. And I'll just mention that our

153
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,600
work in evolution of a natural selection agrees with, with the physicists. Evolution also entails

154
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,120
that space and time and objects in space and time are not fundamental. So, so that means that

155
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,640
neurons don't exist when they're not perceived, but, but, but that is not to put down neurobiology.

156
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,160
In fact, what I say is we need more money for neurobiology because we realize it's a lot harder

157
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,400
than we ever thought. We thought, you know, there's 86 billion neurons in the brain and,

158
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,120
you know, that's a hard problem, but, but that's just the interface representation. That's, that's

159
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:02,120
the dumb down version. The real complex version is being hidden from us. And we have to really reverse

160
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,320
engineer neurobiology and space time to something deeper. It's going to be far more complicated

161
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,960
and we'll have to see how it projects down to space time. So, so I think that, that time is,

162
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,680
is not fundamental. And in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents,

163
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,520
there is no entropic arrow of time necessary in the dynamics. So, we can have a dynamics in which

164
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,080
there is a sequence parameter, but there is the entropy does not increase. But it turns out it's

165
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:39,240
a theorem that if you take a projection of the dynamics on by say conditional probability,

166
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,280
that any projected view of the dynamics, you'll get a new dynamics that's a, you know, projection

167
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,160
of the bigger dynamics of the fundamental dynamic, that new dynamics will have an arrow of time.

168
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,920
Just because of the loss of information that happened in the projection process.

169
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,480
So, so that makes sense. Space time is just our virtual reality headset. It's a projection. It loses

170
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,360
information. We have an arrow of time because of that loss of information. In other words, time

171
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,720
is not an insight into the nature of reality. It's just an artifact of the projection process,

172
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,880
purely an artifact and not an, not an insight. There's more to say, but I'll stop there because

173
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't want to do it. Mike, do you agree? Or you have anything to add to that, Mike?

174
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,960
Yeah. Well, I think, I think it's a, it's a, it's a very profound idea. And, and I think that

175
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:45,000
I, I wonder if we can generalize that to say that it's almost, it's almost guaranteed that

176
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:56,440
agents will, will build models of their world that may or may not agree with other agents

177
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,800
models of their world, because as Don has very nicely shown rigorously, evolution isn't looking

178
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,360
for that. It's just looking for expedient representations. And so it's entirely possible

179
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,600
that there are, I mean, so, so Chris Fields and I work on this kind of stuff a lot from the perspective

180
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,160
of observers and this idea that everything is some observer's vantage point description.

181
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,440
And so I think it makes complete sense to me that from certain vantage points,

182
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,160
things look like there's, there's space and time, but you know, it's like, it's like,

183
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,840
we have mathematical tools, you know, neural nets and things like that, that will

184
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,280
take, take their experience and project it into some crazy space where you can't make heads of

185
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,760
tails of what the principal components are. And, and, and because, and this is what happens to,

186
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,160
to us all, we make, we make some kind of representation that seems to be good enough

187
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,280
for survival and various other things. But, but none of that should be taken as, as, as,

188
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,400
as fundamental. And the other, the other thing that this is maybe stepping away a little bit,

189
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,640
but, but I think it bears on this, on this topic as far as, you know, space, space and time have

190
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,160
served well, they've in physics, right, they've done a nice job and everything. But I think,

191
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,240
I think we have to ask somebody, somebody once said, I remember who it was that them,

192
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,520
if you show me the fishing net that you're using, I'll show you the fish you're going to catch,

193
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,480
which is that we have to think about what are these tools good for and what are they not good for.

194
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,960
And one of the things that I've been increasingly sort of focusing on this, this idea that

195
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,760
the world looks like a mechanical, mechanistic place when you use tools that are low agency

196
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,760
tools. So when you use voltmeters and rulers and things like this, all you're ever going to see

197
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,920
is low agency stuff, you're going to see things that look like mechanism. Of course,

198
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,040
it's going to look like mechanism because that's the, that's the lens you're using.

199
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,480
And so we can't then assume that, well, that must be right. And just assume that, okay,

200
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,280
it's all got to be bottom up because those are the tools that we use. And what if, what if

201
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,240
the things you're going to find have to be in some impedance match, almost are

202
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,520
the tools that you're using. And so we suppose you're looking for things like agents or you're

203
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,640
looking for virtual governors or top-down controllers, you're not going to find that

204
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,320
with low agency tools. What can you find that with? Well, you find it with brains and you find it

205
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:34,760
with minds that are primed to look for agency. These things that are, we don't have a voltmeter

206
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:44,120
that measures causal information, new theory and whatnot. These things that Eric Hall and other

207
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,160
folks study these high level, integrated information and all that. You don't have a voltmeter

208
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,960
that, of course you don't. But, and so you don't find any of that when you use those tools all you

209
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,040
ever see as mechanism. But when you look at the world using a tool, for example, our own mind

210
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,800
and our observational system, then we're very good at detecting agency. Of course, we make mistakes

211
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,080
in both directions, right? We have false positive and false negatives. But minds are really good

212
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,160
tools to find other minds, voltmeters or not. And so, right? So maybe there's something there.

213
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,720
Maybe it's this idea that, yes, of course, these things have been with us and they do a nice job

214
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,200
on the kinds of things that they're good at, which is describing mechanical,

215
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,720
mechanistic interactions. And I think what Don has highlighted very, very effectively is that

216
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,560
we cannot assume that, well, that's our fishing net and that's all there is to find. That's clearly,

217
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,640
right? They're letting us find certain kinds of things and they're also obscuring lots of other

218
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,600
important things. Thank you. So let me summarize it, Don. So you're saying no physical objects,

219
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,200
including my body, it's conscious, strictly speaking, right? So my brain isn't conscious

220
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,320
because my brain, in fact, doesn't even exist. And then space time is not fundamental. So this

221
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,280
standard view that we all took for granted, objective reality we see with our eyes is not

222
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:17,320
surviving bonkers. So having this view with the evolution theory, has it affected your

223
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,360
perceptions and your behavior when you come to interacting with the world?

224
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes. And I think the way you put it is well put. And what Mike has been saying is,

225
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:37,160
I completely agree. And it's brilliant. And the fishing net example is a really good example

226
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,480
that, you know, we don't see the world as it is. We see it through the lens of our own concepts and

227
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:51,960
the way we, you know, what we do. And there's no escaping that. And so in effect, as well,

228
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,000
as we talked about, you have to recreate yourself all the time, right? That was Mike saying,

229
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:05,800
you're always recreating yourself all the time. Well, you're also recreating the world all the

230
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:12,520
time. So I have a body when I look, and I have neurons when I look. And when I don't look,

231
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,960
they're not there. So every time I look. So this is really quite,

232
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,400
if you're in a virtual reality game, your avatar is there only when you see it.

233
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,040
And the avatar that someone else sees of you is there when they see it. And as soon as they

234
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,720
turn their heads somewhere else, that avatar is gone. And they're looking at something else.

235
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,880
And so, yeah, we're recreating all the objects inside of space and time on the fly as needed.

236
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,160
And that includes all of my neurons and my body. So these things, you know, it's,

237
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,480
and we have the illusion that they're there all the time, because every time I look, I see it.

238
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,280
But you can get the same illusion in virtual reality, right? You know, if you're playing a

239
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,880
good game, you can get immersed in the game. Every time I look over to the right, I see the mountain.

240
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,040
So it must mean the mountains there all the time. No, no, you're only rendering the mountain when

241
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,440
you look. The fact is, you always render the mountain every time you look that direction,

242
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,800
but that doesn't mean the mountain was there. You still have to create it all the time.

243
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,240
There is something, there is a reality. But so we get confused, because when we go, well,

244
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,080
there must be some reality. Yeah, absolutely, there is a reality. It's just not inside space

245
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,560
and time, because it's not inside the virtual reality, because there you have to render everything

246
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:33,640
for it to exist in the only exists in the rendering process. So yes, this has a personal impact,

247
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:43,320
right? I mean, first, when I first realized, I had to just sit down and to absorb it. And that was

248
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:51,560
35 years ago. And I'm still absorbing it. And it's a shock to me. And I think it's a shock to

249
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:58,040
almost everybody, except maybe, you know, advanced meditators and so forth. You know, maybe for them

250
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:05,240
is not as much of a shock, but it's still a shock to the system. And I think Piaget gave us the very

251
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:12,680
famous child psychologist Piaget gave us some insight as to why it's so shocking. And he pointed

252
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:21,080
out that we're programmed to believe in what he called object permanence. He thought we got object

253
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:27,240
permanence by 18 months. Later studies showed that it was probably more like a three or four months.

254
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:34,040
So this is before we're rational, right? We're not reasoning and logically thinking about things.

255
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,280
We're just programmed to believe that that doll exists, and will continue to exist,

256
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:46,840
even if it's behind a pillow when I can't see it. Piaget was looking at, you know, babies with

257
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,920
dolls. When are they going to go looking for the doll that they can't see? You know, when do they

258
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:58,520
believe the doll still exists? And so we're programmed to, so our belief that the sun exists

259
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:08,120
even when we don't look is not, we didn't come to that belief based on rational, logical, cold

260
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:15,880
logic. We came to it at three months of age because we're programmed to believe that. And so

261
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:25,720
that's why my merely intellectual understanding that it's false has not yet

262
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,320
penetrated my emotional work. It's still quite a shock emotionally, absolutely.

263
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,760
Mike, has it changed your perceptions of the world?

264
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,240
Yeah. Well, I guess what I want to say, two things. One about things that don't change and one

265
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:56,200
about things that do. I once had lunch with a philosopher who was a very strong skeptic on

266
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,240
Free Will. And when the waitress came over and said, so, Professor X, what kind of soup will you

267
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,960
have? And she said, well, let me think. I said, hey, what are you doing? Why don't you sit back

268
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,040
and see what soup gets ordered? What are you doing choosing a soup here? And so that's just

269
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,800
to say that. I mean, I understand, of course, the argument and everything. But the point is

270
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,240
that's one of those things that you can be a skeptic about Free Will. But I don't think you

271
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,360
can live your life. I think it's one of those views that is just impossible to connect with on

272
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,440
a practical level for a strong reason that we can talk about. I think actually that and object

273
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,160
permanence goes back to the bacterial, microbial level. And so we can talk about that. But I think

274
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:51,320
it is impossible for a coherent mind that evolved under realistic constraints to not believe in

275
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,880
being an agent that does things. I think, right, I just don't think you can, no matter what you

276
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,520
write about Free Will, I don't think you can live. The thing that I think does change some of these

277
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,120
things is this. And this is just a question I'll pose to all of you. And whoever's listening,

278
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,080
I think it's an interesting question. I've done a poll of all my friends with this. Imagine, and

279
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,360
I think people split into two types of people along this question. Imagine some pleasant

280
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,840
experience that you would be willing to pay $100. It's a nice massage or something, whatever it

281
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,760
is. It's a nice, it's a nice discreet experience that you could have. And so I'm going to give you

282
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,760
two choices. You can have that experience right now, but you're going to have no memory of it

283
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,080
later. None, it's wiped, it wipes your memory. So let's say, you know, you've always wanted to go

284
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,080
skydiving and it's free. But afterwards, you will have no memory of having done it. Okay, so that's

285
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,040
option one. Option two is the exact opposite. We're not going to do it, but you're going to

286
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,120
have a memory of having done it. But you're not actually going to get to do it now. So which do

287
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:04,360
you prefer? Right? And what I find is that people have very strong feelings about this.

288
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,000
But about half of the people I talk to, and it's really about half and half, I think,

289
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,240
people that I talk to, half of them say, well, the now moment is going to be gone anyway. All

290
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,320
I really have are memories of anything, you know, I don't care what happens now. Give me the memory

291
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,560
of this beautiful, you know, skydive or whatever. And somebody else will say, well, who wants to

292
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,440
go around collecting memories? I like experiences. I want to have the experience. Everything else is

293
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,840
fake. I live in the now. Let's do it. And so I don't care if I don't remember it afterwards.

294
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,400
And so this is a really interesting, I think, division point of how you see yourself. Do you

295
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,160
see yourself as this like evanescent agent? And then, and then, you know, three hours from now,

296
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,120
that's not really going to be me anyway. So who cares what that I'm how I want the experience

297
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,080
now, that's all that exists. And then you've got the people who are like, no, no, all I am is,

298
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,240
is this, you know, collection of memory. So let's add to that. And there is no now, it'll be gone

299
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,080
shortly. So, so I think pondering that one and thinking about which type you are, I think, I

300
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,360
think that's kind of instructive and and how and how different people can can really differ on that.

301
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,640
So yeah, it's a it's a really interesting thing. So I my memories, my memory is not that good.

302
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,960
I really it just like when when I first read when I when I was young, I first read about this,

303
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,520
this idea that your memories could be false. I had, I was like, yeah, of course, I could barely

304
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I mean, my memory, I don't know, you know, I don't really trust it that much anyway, it seemed to

305
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,800
make perfect sense. And so I'm one of these guys who takes lots of pictures and, you know, records

306
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:46,520
everything because that's I find it hard to kind of replay it later. So so from from from that

307
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:55,400
perspective, I can I can sort of see both views. I think that my memories aren't worth the raw

308
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,640
memories aren't worth all that much. So I would I would take the immediate experience. But but in

309
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,480
real life, I sort of augment that with with all kinds of stuff, right? So I think tons of photographs

310
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,360
and videos and whatnot. So yeah, I don't know, I think it's a it's a profound set of questions.

311
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I have I have a silly questions. So dinosaurs not real?

312
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,680
Both of you. So are you saying that dinosaurs is not real? Then it's just a perceptions of us then

313
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,360
the vi has said.

314
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,640
Well, so I'll go after that. So it's quite good. I mean, so, you know, dinosaurs disappeared 65

315
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,760
million years ago or something like that, right? And and and that's that's our space time story. And

316
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:49,240
it's I think it's a good story. But but I would say, yes, there there is some reality. But it's

317
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:55,320
not in space and time. And if you get you get the right answer, if you think about virtual

318
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,360
reality most of the time. So you just always think about virtual reality. And so is is that car

319
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,600
that you're seeing in virtual reality? Is it really there? Well, no, it's not. It's there when you

320
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,880
look. Is there some reality that is causing you to see that car? Yeah, but it's not a car. It's

321
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,480
maybe some supercomputer or something outside of your virtual reality. So so so yeah, we we will

322
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:25,560
find dinosaur bones and we will date them a 65 million years. And that's our virtual reality

323
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:33,240
perception of it. There is there is some deeper reality that you know, that's real. But but this

324
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,840
is as Mike is saying, we have to recreate this stuff all the time on the fly. And and and so so

325
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,600
yeah, that dinosaur experience that you're having when you dig up that bone right now.

326
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:57,320
That experience only exists in the moment. And that bone didn't exist as a bone until you

327
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:05,160
perceived it. There is some other reality that does anybody else who wants to go and dig in

328
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,680
that area to see the bone, right? So you'll all agree. But you also agree in virtual reality,

329
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,800
say that, you know, if you're playing Grand Theft Auto, that everybody would agree. Oh, yeah,

330
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,280
you're racing a green Porsche. Everybody agrees that you're racing a green Porsche. That doesn't

331
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,520
mean that there really is a green Porsche. It just means everybody agrees. And so we all agree

332
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,760
that we see dinosaurs and we all agree that in our heads up, they look like they're 65 million

333
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,600
years old or older. But agreement doesn't mean that it has a preexisting reality.

334
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,640
So are you saying Max Delbert? He was

335
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,200
No, no, who's who's talking right now?

336
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,160
All right, it's one of the audience. Can we move on quickly done? Sorry about that.

337
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:55,240
Briefly talk about your model and catch on on the conscious agency so that you and Mike could

338
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,320
compare the two models. So you talk on your conscious agency and the mathematical sites of

339
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,640
it and then Mike could unpack it from his perspective on the biology side of it. Shall

340
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,920
we go on that? Sure, sure. Back to the Max Delbert thing later on in the Q&A. Absolutely. So I

341
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:20,280
didn't want to rudely stop anybody. I just didn't know who was talking. So so the conscious agent

342
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:27,080
model is a precise model of consciousness. I'm not saying it's the right model,

343
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,800
but it's at least mathematically precise in which we have agents that have experiences

344
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,680
and based on those experiences, they take actions that affect the experiences of other conscious

345
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:43,800
agents of interacting conscious agents. And the mathematics is basically Markovian. It's a

346
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,840
Markov chain that you get on this collection, this network of conscious agents. And

347
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,920
one of the things that we're doing right now in the model, which is for our next paper, which is

348
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,560
really fun, is looking at the role of observation. So the only thing to observe is other consciousnesses,

349
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,000
right? The consciousnesses are observing consciousnesses. And it's a theorem of this theory

350
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,680
that any collection of consciousness agents is itself a bigger agent. So ultimately, the math

351
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,280
says there's one agent. But it also tells us that we can never write down the one agent because

352
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,280
it would be infinitely long. So you can't write it down. So it's interesting that the theory says

353
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,480
there is one conscious agent, but it will transcend any precise mathematical description.

354
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,040
But we can build as big an agent as we want. And so that's what we have to do. So we have to be

355
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,840
modest and build big agents, but we can't build the one agent. And the only thing there is to

356
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,040
observe is consciousness. And it's only conscious agents that are there to observe it. So what we

357
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:57,160
can do is we can take a huge agent, which has a huge number of experiences, a huge number of states

358
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,240
that it perceives. So maybe, you know, a billion by it's a billion states, a billion experiences

359
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:12,040
that it can have. And we can then take any subset of states from it, maybe just 100,000 over or

360
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,600
2 million. And that will also correspond to a sub agent. So this will be a sub agent of this

361
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:25,400
bigger agent. And then we can take the Markovian dynamics of the big agent and do what's called

362
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:32,120
a trace chain. We can look at the Markovian dynamics that's induced on the little agent

363
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,440
as a consequence of the big dynamics. So it's called a trace chain. So every time,

364
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,880
most of the time, the state of the big agent is not in the state of one of the states of

365
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,840
the little agent. But when it does, then we will, you know, that little agent will get activated

366
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,360
and we can then build its Markov kernel. You know, we can actually describe over time what

367
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,040
is Markovian kernel is. So there's some big Markovian kernel, but we can induce

368
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,600
little Markovian kernels on all the sub agents. So if you have a big agent with N

369
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,760
states and experiences that it can perceive, then there are two to the N sub agents,

370
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,720
including the original agent, two to the N sub agents. So, and so you have two to the N

371
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,160
different Markovian kernels or trace chains that you can look at. And so you're now going

372
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,480
to get a very interesting group structure. So how do the different agents see the deeper reality?

373
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,000
So you will, I bet we'll see in some cases, we can get a Lorentz transformation relating them

374
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
or Euclidean transformation. So we will start to see how the different agents

375
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,240
perceptions differ systematically as you change the agent. But the other thing that is interesting

376
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,840
is that not only the, we might call the spatial window, which particular subset of states you're

377
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,880
using, but how many steps of the chain do you want to look at? Do you want to look at only 50

378
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,760
steps or 100 or a billion or a trillion? I mean, ultimately Markov chains are supposed to go off

379
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:13,560
to infinity. But imagining finite temporal windows, and it turns out when you do that,

380
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:21,320
what each sub agent will see depends almost entirely on this temporal window as well as the

381
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:28,120
spatial window. So when you have a very small temporal window, you will, and I can go into the

382
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,600
mathematics of this, but what you will see with small temporal windows is what we believe will

383
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:41,400
turn out to be bosons in physics. These are massless particles. So Don, and you'll see

384
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,440
tons of bosons. So Don, the matter matter sites of it, right? The W represents the world, and then

385
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:54,920
you got the perceived, the P, and then you got the A, the R, and then you got the measurable,

386
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,480
you got the measurable space between the experience, the acts, and then the action, the G.

387
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,720
So what is that measurable experience that you're measuring though?

388
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,280
So what are those measurable spaces? Yeah. So those measurable spaces are probability spaces.

389
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,560
So anytime that you have some kind of probabilistic dynamics, you need to have a probability

390
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:26,440
space in which the dynamics can take place. And so that's the case with these Markovian

391
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,240
dynamics. And what's interesting is I didn't think about that for the longest time. We, you know,

392
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,440
it's just derigure that if you're going to write down a, you know, probability,

393
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,720
then you have to write down a probability space. And I didn't even think about what the probability

394
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,800
so years later, but I realized that I was only focused on the experiences. But what about the

395
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,320
probability space in which they occur? And it seems to me that a natural interpretation

396
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:59,960
of the probability space itself is to be interpreted as pure awareness without any

397
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,360
particular content, something that spiritual traditions have talked about for a long time.

398
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,160
So here is the pure awareness, which is the potential. I'm sorry.

399
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:18,040
Is it the verdict you're talking about, the Indian philosophy about the observer position,

400
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,320
the afman, go backward to the brahman? Is that the one that you're talking about?

401
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:30,360
That would be, I think that's one example of it. I think all the different spiritual traditions

402
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,800
point with their own words to the same kind of thing. And what was interesting to me was,

403
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,360
I mean, I wasn't trying to model that. I just was trying to do the math and I had to write

404
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:46,200
down a probability space. And I didn't even think about it. And it was only years that

405
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,160
probability space. And the only interpretation that makes sense is something along the lines of this

406
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,120
unbounded potential for experience, namely awareness of pure awareness without any particular

407
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:06,040
content. And then many spiritual traditions will then say, that is what you are. You are

408
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,800
not the particular content, this particular body or this particular color that you're seeing or

409
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,200
this particular headache that you're feeling. That's not what you are. Those are just experiences

410
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,480
that are arising in this fundamental awareness. And you are that fundamental awareness, not just

411
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:33,480
the things that arise. So Don, the end represents our selfhood, the observer position. That's where

412
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:42,920
the end comes in. And that triangle, mathematical graph. Oh, well, in the perception, decision,

413
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,520
action loop, and there's also an integer n that we have there, that was simply just to

414
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,440
a counter for the number of steps of the Markovian Internet. So you need a counter,

415
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:01,560
in some sense, to say what step of the chain you're in. So that was just a technical thing.

416
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,720
It's not time. It's just the sequence counter of the Markov chain.

417
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,160
Thank you, Mike. Yeah. So I end up basically at the same point as Don. And let me walk it

418
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,440
backwards towards the biology of where I think it comes from. If you didn't already know what it

419
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,160
was to communicate with a human and somebody showed you a three pound, you know, three and a half

420
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,760
pound brain, and they say, so how many, how many cells do you think you think are in there? Well,

421
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,600
we have absolutely no idea because, because I priori, you don't really know what the dense,

422
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,560
you know, the the agential density of this material is, you have no idea. And, and the thing is that,

423
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,040
and then of course, in, you know, you get to split brain patients and dissociative states, we still

424
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,280
actually, it's still not super clear, you know, how to count these things. But, but it's interesting

425
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,440
that in biology, every, every cell is some other cells neighbor. In fact, every cell, every cellular

426
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,760
neighbor is some other cells external environment. And so this question of, you know, what Don was

427
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:14,680
saying of different, different cells, sort of being within the kind of a larger structure,

428
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:22,040
this is almost guaranteed because, because there is no obvious and unambiguous way to say where

429
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:29,240
any one self ends and any other self begins. And biology is always multi scale and at every,

430
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,560
everything is made up, you know, so, so like Descartes was looking, he liked the pineal gland

431
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,440
because there was just one of them. But one of what if you look inside, it's full of cell,

432
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,040
the thing's full of cells, there's not one of anything. And if you look inside the cells,

433
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,800
guess what you find, you find a bunch of molecules. I mean, there really is no one of

434
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,960
anything, everything is made of sort of components. And, and you really start to see this when you

435
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,520
look at basic embryogenesis, which I think is super important here, it's this, this journey

436
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:59,480
that each of us took from being a an unfertilized, the oocyte, you know, this blob of chemicals

437
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,200
into whatever it is that we are now. Let's just look at the early time points of this, right? So,

438
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,440
so, so what happens is you have, you have this embryonic blastoderm. So it's a flat in, in the

439
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:16,040
mammals and birds, it's like this flat disc. And okay, 50,000 cells or something. So you look at

440
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,560
this thing, and we say, oh, look, there's, that's an embryo. Now, what did you just count as an

441
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,200
embryo? There's one of what, well, there's 50,000 cells, what is there one of? Well, there's one

442
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:33,960
of if you put a particular lens on this thing, and you say, I'm going to count the system that

443
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,160
attempts to that is going to use energy and attempt to build a particular structure. Basically,

444
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,720
what I'm going to count is goal directed systems. I'm going to say how many different

445
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,320
goal directed systems are there. And what you will find is that all of these cells will work

446
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,080
together towards a particular anatomical goal. You can the other way to think about it, if you

447
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,240
don't like go talk, is that it's trying to reach a particular region of anatomical morphous space,

448
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,040
where you've got a couple eyes, you've got the right number of toes, all that stuff. So, so a

449
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,640
bunch of these cells get together, and they're all going to work on this one construction project.

450
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:07,880
Everybody agrees every step, this is what they're, this is what they're working on. Okay, so, so,

451
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,320
so now you've counted one, you say, well, there you go, that's a, that's a separate self, it's a

452
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,000
separate consciousness, it's going to be a human embryo, let's say we know what that looks like.

453
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,680
Except that if you were to come along at that early stage, and I've done this in avian with,

454
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,920
with chicken eggs and things like this, when I was a grad student, you take a little needle,

455
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,720
and you make a couple of scratches in that blastoderm. Eventually, it's going to heal up,

456
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,840
they're going to heal. But before they heal, what happens is that every group of cells that cannot

457
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,640
feel the other cells, because you put a scratch between them, decides that, well, it's just me,

458
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,160
then. And so they form an embryo, and every island forms an embryo, and then when they heal,

459
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:52,280
you have conjoined twins, and or triplets or whatever. So the question of, so you look at an

460
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:59,480
embryo, and you say, well, how many are in there? It could be anywhere from zero to some small

461
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:05,560
number of them, because that question is decided on the fly. It is not pre-programmed, it is decided

462
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:11,560
on the fly by the physiology of a bunch of cells making a decision of how they're going to coalesce

463
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,920
towards one machine that's going to take this morphogenetic journey, this movement through

464
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,720
anatomical morphospace. So what happens then is that you realize that what you've got is you've

465
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,720
got this almost like this Freudian ocean of possibility, these 50,000 cells, and out of them

466
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,000
might come some number of intelligences. And once you realize that that's the case, and that

467
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:40,600
within this one thing, there could be three different conjoined twins, and this, of course,

468
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,560
happens in humans as well as other animals, then you realize that fine, the adult human body,

469
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:53,000
or any animal body, also has within it various collectives, such as organs and various other

470
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,320
things that for the exact same, and so I'll just back up and say that I don't have a theory of

471
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,080
consciousness that I'm sort of propagating, like many other people do, I don't have my own, maybe

472
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,240
I will at some point, I don't now, so I don't have too much to say about consciousness except this.

473
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,200
All, as far as I can tell, all of the theories of consciousness that try to explain why brains

474
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:23,480
are associated with consciousness in some way, for the exact same reason that all of those theories

475
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,600
pick the brain to be able to do it, pretty much every tissue in your body should be judged as

476
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:34,280
conscious, because all of these things that these theories talk about, and let's say the neuroscience

477
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,680
theories, they lean on things like, well, there are these integrated electrical networks and we've

478
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,240
got some neurotransmitters and some ion channel, all of this stuff exists all over your body.

479
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:50,280
I have yet to come across a theory of consciousness that tells you why the brain is different from

480
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:55,400
anything else. And when you sort of start to poke at it, they say, well, then it's the magnetic

481
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,840
field of it. They say, okay, how about the magnetic field of the liver? Why is that different?

482
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,520
Well, I guess it probably isn't. I mean, that's right, that's where you end up. There's just no

483
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,960
one has drawn that line for a very good reason, because neurons evolved from systems that were

484
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,120
other cell types that were using these electrical communications long before brain showed up.

485
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:18,280
So for the same reason that you might now, consciousness is not going to be verbal consciousness,

486
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,360
you're not going to talk to it using using language, and you're probably not aware of it

487
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:29,160
anymore than you are aware of your other nonverbal hemisphere and the opinions that it has that

488
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,000
you don't even know about, because you're not aware of it. But it's entirely plausible,

489
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,320
given the developmental biology, that we are these nested hierarchies of diverse

490
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,960
conscious agents that are all having experiences and solving problems in different spaces,

491
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,560
all kinds of weird spaces. So transcriptional, so gene expression spaces, metabolic spaces,

492
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,600
physiological spaces, anatomical spaces, we love the three-dimensional sort of space of

493
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,320
the where it's easy for us to recognize intelligence, but that's just our own limitation.

494
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:07,000
If you had a, just imagine that you had a primary sense of your own blood chemistry,

495
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,800
instead of, in addition to your retina that looks outwards for medium-sized objects moving at medium

496
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,800
speeds, you would also have an internal sensor of your blood chemistry and you could feel it.

497
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,080
You would have no problem recognizing your liver as extremely intelligent,

498
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,600
because it would be solving all these problems on a daily basis and you would know, you would feel

499
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,920
it. I mean, the same way that we see, oh, look, that crow in that octopus, look at the amazing

500
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,560
things they're doing. You would see your liver doing that stuff every day if you had the perception

501
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:36,680
of this other space. And we can build things, right? So at some point, we'll talk about synthetic

502
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:42,760
beings and we can build things that will have consciousness in those spaces. But so I end up

503
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:49,960
exactly where Don ends up. I think that we are these nested hierarchies of consciousness. This is

504
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,560
only some of them are verbal. Only some of them do we have any direct connection to, but they're

505
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,960
all over the place and we're bad at recognizing them and that's why we need to, you know, we need

506
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:09,960
to think about these things more. Don? Brilliant. That's brilliant, Mike. And I agree. I'm definitely

507
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,320
not the biologist that Mike is, but I'll just throw in another simple biology example to support

508
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,120
what he's saying. And that is with split brain patients, right? So some people who have intractable

509
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:29,800
epilepsy that can't be treated with normal drugs were in extreme cases where they were,

510
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:36,760
their lives were on the line, submitted to a surgery called colosotomy surgery, where they would

511
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Joe Bogan, who was a friend of mine, would actually take a scalpel and go in there and cut the corpus

512
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:47,400
colosum, which was a band of about 220 million fibers that connect the right and left hemispheres

513
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,480
of the brain. And it was a success. If the epileptic focus was on the right hemisphere,

514
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:59,320
you would spare the left hemisphere from getting bothered by an epileptic seizure. And so it was

515
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,800
a clinical success. But then some other friends of mine and other researchers started to study,

516
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:11,240
what's different about these people that have their brains cut in half? And Mike Zaniga and many

517
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:18,760
others, but did this. But friend of mine, Ramacandra, V.S. Ramacandran at UC San Diego, friends called

518
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,320
Rama. So what Rama did was he found one patient in which the right hemisphere, I believe,

519
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:33,320
was an atheist and left hemisphere believed in God. So here, and another case was found in

520
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,920
which the right hemisphere wanted to be a race car driver and the left hemisphere wanted to have a

521
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:45,320
desk job. So you have, you know, those are as different a personality as you could possibly want

522
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,880
stuck inside one cranium. And so that raises the question, here I am with my corpus colosum intact.

523
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:59,000
And why is it that on Friday night, a battle going on about what I want? Maybe one part of me

524
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,760
says, let's go out and have fun. The other part says, no, I got a book I want to read.

525
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,560
Well, maybe there are two people in there. And they really want to do two different things on

526
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:14,280
Friday night. And I do have to negotiate among them. And so who is the I now that is doing

527
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,400
the negotiation among those two people? So the whole notion of a self then becomes really interesting

528
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:28,680
and very problematic. So I agree completely with Mike on that. And again, a big issue here is

529
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:37,720
we're only seeing things through a space time interface. Right. And so it's not like, for

530
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,600
example, the distinction we make between living and non living, or conscious and unconscious

531
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,640
is a principle distinction. Right. So just to get what I'm talking about here, I'm looking at

532
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:56,120
all of you on a zoom screen. So I'm looking at Mike right now on the zoom screen. And some of the

533
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:03,080
pixels are pixels for Mike's face. And when I look at those pixels, I'm getting a portal into

534
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,520
Mike's consciousness. I can tell if he's interested, I can tell if he's bored, I can tell

535
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,560
I get some insight into his consciousness. But there are other pixels of a floor, for example,

536
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:17,320
in the back of this chair. And those pixels are not giving me any insight about consciousness.

537
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,440
Now, should I say that some pixels are conscious? And other pixels on my zoom screen are not

538
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:27,960
conscious. That's stupid. Pixels are pixels. They're not conscious or unconscious. Some of

539
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,800
them are giving me a portal into Mike's consciousness and others are not. So it's not so the same thing

540
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,160
is true of space and time and what we call physical objects. There is the distinction we make between

541
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,640
Oh, that's alive. And that's dead or that's conscious. And that's not conscious is the same

542
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,720
mistake as saying, Oh, those are those are conscious pixels. And those are unconscious pixels on my

543
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,840
zoom screen. It's exactly the same mistake. An interface is just an interface. It's not the

544
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,000
truth. So, so it's not a principal distinction between living and non living. It's an artifact

545
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,680
of the limitations of our interface that we're mistaking for insight into the nature of reality.

546
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:12,440
It's a rookie mistake. So we have to get past the rookie mistake of saying that the distinctions

547
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,760
that we see in our interface are therefore necessarily true in reality.

548
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,720
Sorry, I just want to add one one funny. Well, I don't know if it's funny, but a story of a kind

549
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,480
of a troubling story that that goes with Don's point about having two different opinions in

550
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:36,840
your in your brain. And so I read this. This was a description of a therapist as a psychiatrist

551
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,480
to have this experience. So, so this guy this patient comes in and he says, I've got some sort

552
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,080
of dissociative disorder where I've got there's a personality in there that he's a real partier

553
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,440
and and I like to work and and he just started, you know, I can't I can't work anymore because

554
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,200
sometimes he comes out and screws up, you know, he acts, you know, acts like a fool at work and

555
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,960
whatever we need to take care of this. And so, you know, they start doing some sort of I don't

556
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,840
even know how they do it, but some sort of integrative therapy and so so one day one day

557
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,080
the patient walks in and it's the other guy. And he says, Hey, what's this I hear about

558
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:12,120
integrating integrate? What are you guys doing? And the doctor says, Well, you know, we're going

559
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:18,920
to integrate you. And he says, Excuse me, you're going to integrate me and who's going to be left?

560
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,840
He says, Well, you know, you'll be well, you'll do well at work. Wait a minute,

561
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:27,000
wait a minute, where am I going to be? And he's and the doctor said, Well, you're kind of going

562
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,920
to be gone. I hope if you know, if we do, are you kidding? What? What happened to the hypocriticals?

563
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,480
What do you mean? I'm going to be gone. I don't want to be gone. You know, he's a boring, you

564
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,200
know, he's boring. I've got the fun life to make him gone. And so and right. So just put yourself

565
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:49,560
in that in that place, right? I mean, presumably the other, you know, the other personality signs

566
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,520
the checks and everything. But but but but you're faced with a coherent. This isn't some weird tick

567
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,640
or reflex. This is a coherent being that is making an argument that knows what what a

568
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,120
hypocritical it is and is making an argument that whatever that whatever you're doing is going

569
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,960
to erase them from the world by sort of somehow jamming you down into this into this integrated

570
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:16,040
personality that can spend, you know, 12 hours at work and not have any fun. So that's, I mean,

571
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:21,720
that's a super, you know, it's a super disturbing sort of kind of, you know, way to think about this

572
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:29,080
because we there are no as far as I know, there are no indivisible beings. We are all made of

573
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:35,240
parts that that's just how it has to be. And therefore, there is the possibility of that,

574
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:41,560
that magical, which I think if anything is magical, this is it, it's this this this process by which

575
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:48,840
by which merge into a larger scale, collective, you know, self or individual, that that process

576
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,680
is going to have failure modes, some of them temporary, some of them permanent. And and it's

577
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:57,320
these failure modes that really give us something to think about in terms of what are we and who

578
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:05,320
are we and how we relate to each other. Fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, we recently have McGiocchus. Ian

579
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:11,960
McGiocchus came to our club last Monday. Yeah, he has booked the matter with things. Yeah, he talked

580
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:19,160
about the the laugh and right hemisphere hypothesis a lot in his book on his volume one. Yeah, we're

581
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:27,080
going to quickly move on before because Mike got to go pretty soon, probably about 30 minutes

582
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,360
time. But but don't you can stay with us for another hours, right? So that I'm going to go

583
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:39,560
straight to the the last question. So these conscious agents, the common factor done. So all

584
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:47,080
these multi multiplicity and diversity of conscious agents. So how many of them so they're all going

585
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:54,040
towards one field of consciousness. Is that what it is? And you speak on that, right? So

586
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:01,160
so there's it's quite interesting. Suppose I start off with a countable infinity of conscious

587
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,080
agents. So there's agent one, two, three, four, all the way to the countable infinity, then any

588
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:13,160
combination of any subset of them. So agent one and two, agent one, two and three, whatever, that

589
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:19,160
also is a conscious agent. That's a theorem of the math that any collection of conscious agents is

590
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,640
also a conscious agent. So that means that I started off with a countable infinity of

591
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,600
conscious agents. I can take the power set with what the mathematicians call the power set.

592
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,400
That's the number of new conscious agents that come from combination. Well, that's a higher

593
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:41,000
level of infinity. That's, you know, a left one. And now with that new set of agents, I can take

594
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,360
their power set. Now I'm at a left to consciously. So now I'm marching my way up Cantor's hierarchy

595
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:55,000
of infinities, and there's no end to that hierarchy of infinities. So so it's a it's a theorem that

596
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,120
there is just one. And it's also a fact that I'll never be able to get there, which is again,

597
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,640
again, also in line with the spiritual traditions, right, that they they say that anything that we

598
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:13,640
can say about it, like the Buddhists will say, a finger pointing to the moon is not the moon,

599
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,680
is just a finger pointing. And so that will be true of our scientific descriptions as well. We

600
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:26,760
have to recognize that the scientific distractions are scientific theories are merely

601
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:33,480
pointers, and they're not the reality. And in this case, what's what's nice about the scientific

602
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,200
pointers is that they tell you that they're not the reality, they tell you that they are limited.

603
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,640
And that's what's beautiful about the scientific pointers, like Einstein series space time. And

604
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,960
with quantum field theory tells us that that pointer that space time idea fails at 10 to the

605
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,640
minus 33 centimeters, that's where the pointer stops, and the moon begins, right, whatever's

606
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:04,360
beyond begins. And so, so the conscious agent theory has the same nice property. It says,

607
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:10,520
basically, there is one conscious agent. And I can't describe it, I can, I can go to a left

608
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,880
zero, I can go maybe to go to a left one. Of course, even then I'll fail because I don't have a

609
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,120
super computer that can do it. So and I don't have enough paper to do it. So already you can see

610
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:26,040
that that is telling you this is a pointer and the reality is going to transcend the pointer

611
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:34,120
completely. Absolutely. Mike, did you agree in that night? They're all pointed to one or you're

612
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:44,840
still keen on your panpsychism? I think, I think both. I think they're not mutually exclusive.

613
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:55,720
I think that there are, I mean, to me, recognizing agency and consciousness in the world around

614
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:03,000
you is a lens that you bring to the process like any other. And so if you if you have a way of

615
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:11,240
recognizing intelligence in components of something that's great, and then you may have, you may also

616
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,840
observe that the whole thing is so so so just to give an example, we recently, there's this there's

617
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,160
this mathematical notion of a gene regulatory network, it's very simple. It's a collection of

618
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,480
nodes, let's say a dozen of these nodes. And you're just going to write down how each one up or down

619
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,840
regulates some others. So it's this like little network. And you can, you know, people have been

620
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,440
like Stu Kaufman has been studying this for a long time. And you can you can view them as as

621
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,800
dynamical systems and see what they do and so on. So you look at this thing, and you say, well,

622
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,520
okay, it's very simple, I can see all the parts, there's nowhere to hide here. This is like the

623
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:55,000
rock bottom of deterministic, you know, zero agency mechanical system, there's just nothing there.

624
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,960
So we took the hypothesis. So my view always is that you can't just make these pronouncements

625
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,400
from a from an armchair, you have to do experiments. So we said, okay, what if we just

626
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:09,320
what if what if we test the hypothesis that this thing has some degree of, of, of cognitive

627
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:14,040
of cognitive ability. So what we what we ended up doing was testing their learning capacity

628
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:19,320
in the following in the following way, we assign some one of the nodes as a condition stimulus,

629
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:24,920
another node as an unconditioned stimulus, and pick some other node as the read as the response.

630
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,000
And then we do things like Pavlovian conditioning, we, you know, we twiddle two of them simultaneously

631
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and we look at what happens. Anyway, you get the idea. So so we now have a couple of papers on this

632
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,120
that biological networks, and not so much random networks. So I think evolution likes this because

633
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,760
a biological networks do this more than random ones do biological networks show six different

634
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,720
kinds of learning, including associative conditioning in this in this dirt simple system.

635
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,480
And that's with no, with no changing of the network structure. So we're not changing the

636
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,680
synaptic weights, we're not rearranging the networking, none of that. This is purely,

637
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,800
purely dynamical system stuff. But but but there is a lens. So there are two different two competing

638
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,360
lenses on the same phenomenon. One is the standard molecular biology lens. This thing is dumb as a

639
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,840
rock. And what you if you're going to change the way it works, let's say for biomedical purposes,

640
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,400
your only hope is bottom up rewiring, you need to add nodes, subtract nodes, you know, genomic

641
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,320
editing to change the way that these nodes interact with each other. That's your only hope. There's

642
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:23,240
another lens, which makes a completely different prediction. And if you which is that which is

643
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,720
that actually, if you treat if you don't rewire anything, but you treat this thing as a minimally

644
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,800
cognitive agent that that can be manipulated by experiences, by stimuli, by training, then you

645
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,960
can do some more stuff. And then you can look at these two lessons say, gee, this one tells us a

646
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,880
lot that we can use in biomedicine that we're actually not getting out of here. Right. So so

647
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,640
you can have multiple perspectives, they have different powers in terms of what they let you

648
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,920
do in the real world. Maybe someday somebody else will come along and say, ah, you're both wrong,

649
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:54,520
here's a much better lens, you know, fine, that's how it goes. So so then so then that that allows

650
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:00,680
you to have it all, you can you look at a human body and you say, I'm looking really deep and I

651
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:06,200
see some components that clearly have their own thing going on. But of course, so does the organ

652
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:11,160
that they sit in and because because that has certain certain interesting capabilities in

653
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,320
physiological space. And then the whole thing that we're going to call a human, well, that's a

654
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:19,240
bigger intelligence that can do other things in behavioral space, maybe linguistic space.

655
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:26,040
So I I see it both ways. I think I think the merging is is is correct. I think Don's totally

656
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:31,000
right about all of that. But I also think that there are useful lenses that allow you to exploit

657
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,800
a panpsychist view. And just to be clear, you know, the there's a couple of different versions

658
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,200
of panpsychism. The one where the one where you take a perfectly good physics and then paint some

659
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,600
hopes and dreams on all the electrons, that's not that's not the one, right? So people correctly

660
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,560
make fun of that one, because that's just not going to give you anything. There's a different,

661
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,640
however, research program, which which which Don and people like Chris Fields and Karl first and

662
01:04:53,640 --> 01:05:01,880
other people are doing, which is to reformulate physics from the the cognitive perspective.

663
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,640
So it's not that we have a perfectly good physics. And now we're going to paint some extra junk on

664
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:11,640
it. No, it's that actually, what we have been taking as physics is a, I don't know what the

665
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,520
right word for it, but but it's a it's a it's an oversimplification and a not a really not not

666
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,840
the best lens. I mean, it's done well in many areas, but it's not the best lens. And you can

667
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,360
formulate a different lens, where things like active inference and some of these other extremely

668
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,360
general things, and I don't pretend to be any kind of expert on active inference. But but but I

669
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,720
understand the research program, it helps you understand inanimate things and interactions

670
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:40,840
between living things and non living things from the same with the same lens. And I think that's

671
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:46,280
super powerful. And so I think you can have a useful version of panpsychism, where you scale

672
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,040
down your cognitive expectations. It's not that the rocks have hopes and dreams like humans,

673
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:55,240
that's not the point. The point is that you can use the same tools, including, you know,

674
01:05:55,560 --> 01:06:00,440
active inference and some and trainability and some other things to understand both physical

675
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:06,040
processes and then eventually, you know, advanced cognitive properties, maybe social phenomena,

676
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,360
who knows? Yeah, anyway, so that's a long answer to your question.

677
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:18,280
Thank you. So how many conversations then to make a photon down? That's a question from the audience.

678
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,000
Ah, so

679
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,960
that's what we're going to be working on on our very next paper. We're calling it

680
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,560
tentatively titled traces of consciousness paper. And the idea is that I was talking about these

681
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:42,120
trace chains, right? You've got a big, dynamical system of consciousness agent, a big agent,

682
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,480
but I can look at the two to the n sub agents and do a trace chain on each one of those.

683
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:54,520
And I can change the temporal window. And so I should say just a little bit of background about

684
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,920
what motivates what I'm about to tell you. So in the paper that we just published last week,

685
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,640
we proved that the Markov chains map on two decorated permutations. I mentioned that earlier.

686
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:12,840
Decorated permutations and the decorated permutations the physicists have shown

687
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,720
are the deepest structure they found behind space time. And with decorated permutations, you can

688
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:23,960
then create things like the amplitohedron and compute scattering amplitudes like two gluons

689
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:29,400
smashing into each other and four gluons go spraying out. So you actually, you can compute

690
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:35,080
all of the scattering amplitudes. Truly, if you just have these decorated permutations and maybe

691
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:43,480
momentum and spin data as well. And so when we made this mapping from our Markov dynamics onto

692
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:48,520
decorated permutations and decorated permutations into space time, that gave us the clue there's a

693
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:55,160
particular aspect of our dynamics of conscious agents that's critical for the physics and the

694
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:00,680
mapping of the physics. And it's called the communicating classes. So that's the key thing.

695
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,400
They're so called. So if you look at Markov chains online, you can see what the communicating

696
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:12,680
classes are. It's a standard part of Markov chains. So our hypothesis, the one that I'm working on

697
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,600
right now is that the so-called entropy rate, this is the technical term in Markov chains. So if

698
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:26,680
you look it up online as well, entropy rate of a communicating class is what corresponds to mass

699
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:34,600
in space time. Okay. So particles in space time are projections of communicating classes, but

700
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,680
most communicating classes project to things far more interesting than particles. But particles are

701
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:44,120
projections of communicating classes. And for those communicating classes that project to particles,

702
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:50,360
it's the entropy rate that is their mass. So when you look at what I technically what I just said,

703
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:56,600
it means that if the Markovian dynamics, if the Markov kernel has only zeros and ones

704
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:04,440
in the matrix, then it will project to a massless particle like a photon. So now I'm getting to

705
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:11,480
your question about photons. You can see why I had to spend some time, right? The zero entropy rate

706
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:18,520
communicating classes project to massless particles, or I should say mass lift particle, the better

707
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,640
way to say this, massless particles are the projection of zero communicating, zero entry rate

708
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,720
communicating classes, because communicating classes don't necessarily project to particles,

709
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:32,120
they can project to more interesting things than particles. Particles are the simplest. So

710
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,760
that means, so now we want to find out exactly what specific, there are lots of different

711
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:44,360
kinds of Markovian kernels that are that have zero entropy rate. Some of them are, for example,

712
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,720
are derangements. They're permutations called derangements, and there are other kinds that

713
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:58,120
will have combinations of derangements, as well as absorbing states. So we want to look at those

714
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,800
and then figure out, okay, which correspond to like photons, but photons are not the only kind

715
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:09,400
of bosons. There is also gluons, there are W particles and Z particles, and then there's a

716
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:17,880
Higgs. So there's a number of massless particles, and so we'll want to get this dictionary between

717
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:25,000
the particular kinds of permutation matrices and which ones mapped to which with massless

718
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,400
particles. So that you can see that there's a lot of fun work ahead, but it's a deep technical

719
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:37,640
question. Looking forward to it, Lauren. So we're going to open up the floor for Q&A. We

720
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:45,240
are on the stage waiting to ask both of you some questions. So we're going to open it up now.

721
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:55,080
We have Prakash. Yes, greetings. Fantastic talk, good conversation. I was just curious.

722
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,080
You know, looking at living systems, I always wonder where would you put plants in this picture?

723
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:08,200
Plants are living agents. They don't seem to have neurons, but they have the same cellular space.

724
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:13,160
I was just wondering what you would have to share about what do you think about plants?

725
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,520
Who's the question to us? Prakash, is it to both?

726
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:27,080
Mike makes sense. Yeah, to break out the model.

727
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:38,360
Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Mike, would you want to go first, Mike? Sure, sure. Well, I can do two

728
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:43,720
things. One is, so there certainly are people who study this question of plant intelligence.

729
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:49,720
There have been some nice papers on that. People like Frantisek Balushka and some other folks

730
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:57,000
really talk about plant cognition and plant intelligence. From my perspective,

731
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:02,600
plants are not nearly weird enough as a challenging example for all of this kind of stuff. I mean,

732
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:10,040
and other people, of course, spend time thinking about really minimal models compared to which plants

733
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:17,560
are a no-brainer to pardon the pun for having cognitive capacities, including anticipation

734
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:23,160
and memory and learning and creative problem solving and various things. Plants do all of that.

735
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:30,200
So, yeah, I have zero. The fact that they don't have neurons means almost nothing to me. I think

736
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:37,080
as we think about the wide universe, I find it impossible to believe that the only things that

737
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:41,800
have cognition are things with actual neurons like we have. I mean, that seems like just an

738
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:50,760
incredibly implausible view to me. And we came from, a lot of electrophysiology was done in

739
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:55,880
bacteria anyway. I mean, neurons, they do some interesting things, but this is way wider than

740
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:06,520
that. So, yeah, no problem with plants. I agree with Mike, and I think you said it well. So, yeah,

741
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:13,880
absolutely. Thank you. Are we going to move on to Andy? Hey, thank you both for being here.

742
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,760
This is fascinating. Thank you, Ivy and John, for making this happen.

743
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:23,080
It's hard to decide what to drill into. I would like to drill into this idea of the

744
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:33,400
simulations, the simulations that you claim prove that perception of truth leads to extinction.

745
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:39,400
So, I want to drill in this idea of truth a little bit. What do you mean by truth versus

746
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:45,960
fitness? It seems like fitness is a sort of truth for a biological system. And can you give an

747
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:53,720
example of the perception, like a true perception of a thing leading to less fitness than a false

748
01:13:53,720 --> 01:14:00,920
perception and or a false perception of a thing leading to more fitness than a true perception

749
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:09,640
of a thing? And, you know, and finally, isn't the results say more about the simulation and how

750
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:15,320
it's built and the built-in approximations and assumptions and biases that are built into it,

751
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:24,840
then it says about reality. Thank you. That's a great question. So, I'll first just give you

752
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,400
as for an intuitive example that we might help understand why not knowing the truth could help

753
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:35,080
you out. I'll just give an intuitive example. In virtual reality, say, again, Grand Theft Auto,

754
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:40,040
you're trying to race against a bunch of friends, you know, you got your car and you're racing a

755
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:46,680
Porsche and the Maserati and so forth. And what are you really doing in reality in this metaphor?

756
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:51,080
What you're really doing to win the game is you're toggling millions of voltages per second

757
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:57,320
in a precise order. That's what you're doing to try to win the game. And that's in this metaphor,

758
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:01,080
that's the reality. What you're doing, what you know about what you're doing is you're turning

759
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,880
a steering wheel and you're pushing on a gas pedal. A lot, lot simpler than toggling a million

760
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,160
voltages per second in a precise order. So, now, if you said, well, yeah, I want to know the truth

761
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:14,040
and I'm going to try to play the game knowing the truth. I'm going to actually toggle the million

762
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:20,120
voltages per second to try to win. So, I can guarantee you the person who's trying to toggle

763
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,680
those voltages as fast as they can would lose against someone who is just turning a steering

764
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:30,120
wheel and pushing on the gas. And that's the top-level intuition why evolution hit the truth

765
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,880
from our eyes is because if you had to actually toggle all of reality, you would die in the

766
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,120
process. Better to give you just a user interface that hides most of that from you. So, that's the

767
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:50,840
intuition. But now for the math, we did simulations to begin with just to check to see what would

768
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:57,480
happen. And once we found that organisms that saw a reality word were going extinct, we then

769
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,560
let go of the simulations, we went to the math. So, I went to a mathematician. So, we now have

770
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,040
theorems. So, it's not, we're not relying on simulations at all. We have theorems. And the

771
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,640
theorems are using the tools of evolutionary game theory. And in evolutionary game theory, the key

772
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:17,880
technical notion are fitness payoff functions. The domain of that function includes whatever

773
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,520
objective reality might be. Evolutionary game theory doesn't tell you what objective reality is.

774
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:27,880
It just says there is some objective reality. It could include organisms, their states, their

775
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:36,280
actions, and so forth. And then, so there's this fitness payoff that includes whatever objective

776
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,200
reality is in the domain of the function. And the range of the function are the possible payoff

777
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:46,200
values, say from 0 to 100. 0 means very, very bad. 100 means wonderful, wonderful payoff, say.

778
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:55,960
And you can ask a clean technical question. What is the probability that a generically

779
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:05,800
chosen payoff function will be a homomorphism of some structure in the objective reality,

780
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:12,120
like a total order in objective reality or, you know, a measurable structure or topology

781
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:17,720
or whatever it might be? In other words, what is the probability that a fitness payoff function

782
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:24,360
will actually have information about structures in objective reality? Because if it doesn't have

783
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:29,640
information about the structures, how can it tune you to the structures in objective reality?

784
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:38,600
So we ask the technical question, do fitness payoff functions generically contain information

785
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:45,720
about structures in objective reality? And we, if you want to see the math, you can Google our

786
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:51,960
papers called Fact, Fiction, and Fitness. So that's the paper where we go through the math.

787
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:57,160
And what, Chaitan is the mathematician, not Don Hoffman. Chaitan is the mathematician,

788
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:03,480
but of course we collaborate on it. And what we prove is that for several different structures,

789
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:07,080
but when you see the trend, you realize it's true basically for all structures,

790
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:14,680
the probability is zero, precisely zero, that a generically chosen payoff function

791
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,240
will have any information about objective reality, about any structure in objective

792
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,200
reality. So there's nothing in the fitness payoff functions to tune you to objective reality.

793
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:31,240
Now, I'll just mention a couple quick objections that people see. One objection that

794
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:45,080
made in Sintes recently is, look, you're using evolutionary game theory. So either you believe

795
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:52,600
that evolution, the math of evolutionary game theory models biological evolution correctly,

796
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:58,760
or you don't believe it does. And if you do believe it models biological evolution correctly,

797
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:03,240
well, biological evolution assumes that there are physical objects like organisms in space and

798
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:11,480
time and resources. And if you don't believe that, so if you're going to use evolutionary

799
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:15,080
game theory to say that there are no such thing as physical objects in space, time is fundamental

800
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,960
reality, then that would be contradicted. You'd be contradicting yourself because the math,

801
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:25,960
you're claiming the math faithfully models the physical biology. And if you don't think the math

802
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,880
of evolutionary game theory models the physical biology, then you shouldn't use it anyway because

803
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,200
you didn't think it models. So either way, you're stuck in a logical contradiction. That's

804
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:42,280
sort of his argument. And what that argument misses is how science works. So take Einstein's

805
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:50,360
theory of spacetime and quantum field theory. So these theories assume their mathematical

806
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,320
theories are built on the assumption that spacetime is fundamental. So Einstein's special

807
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,960
relativity and quantum field theory, those mathematical, those assume that spacetime is

808
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:05,560
fundamental. So you could use the same argument. So, but notice what the physicists do is they

809
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:11,000
say our theories tell us that spacetime is doomed. Spacetime is not fundamental. Okay, well, okay,

810
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,960
so I'll use the same, got you logical argument. Well, so either Einstein's math modeled his

811
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:23,880
intuitions, in which case it could not possibly show that spacetime is doomed, or it didn't model

812
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,560
his intuitions, in which case you couldn't use it, you shouldn't use it to show that spacetime

813
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:32,280
was doomed. Well, no physicist would take that seriously. That's a, that's a silly argument.

814
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:39,560
Here's what really goes on in science. Every scientific theory makes assumptions. And there

815
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,440
is no theory of everything. There is no such thing as a scientific theory of everything.

816
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:51,320
So a good scientific theory starts with assumptions and basic concepts, but a good scientific

817
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:59,320
theory will tell you the limits of those concepts. Einstein's theory with quantum field theory tells us

818
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:05,640
the limits of his basic concepts, namely 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, and 10 to the minus 43

819
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:12,840
seconds, you fall apart. So what we're doing is exactly the same thing, but with evolutionary

820
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,720
theory, the assumptions about sure Darwin thought about physical objects in space and time. Absolutely.

821
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:26,200
What are the limits of those concepts? Well, evolutionary game theory is the mathematics,

822
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:32,760
and that mathematics is precise enough to tell us the limits of the basic concepts, just like

823
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:39,320
Einstein's theory of relativity is good enough to tell us the limitations of Einstein's notion

824
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:45,800
of space and time, or spacetime. So this is the way science works. It's not a self refutation.

825
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,600
To think that is actually to misunderstand fundamentally the nature of scientific progress.

826
01:21:53,560 --> 01:22:00,360
Now, what you can't do is to use the old theory to tell you what's next, right? So

827
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:06,040
Einstein's theory tells us spacetime is doomed, but it can't tell you where's the next step

828
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:11,320
beyond spacetime. It can't do that. And similarly, the theory of evolution by natural selection

829
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:17,240
with the mathematics of evolutionary game theory tells you, aha, the notions of organisms in

830
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:24,280
space and time is not fundamental. But does it tell you, okay, what is more fundamental? No,

831
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:28,760
it doesn't tell you what's more fundamental. So that's where the scientists have to make a creative

832
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,800
leap. And physicists have done this just in the last 10 years. They went outside spacetime,

833
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,520
they found the amplitude, Hedron, they found decorated permutations. That's a creative leap.

834
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:43,080
But then what you do is you show how they project back into spacetime, right? You have to go back

835
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:47,880
and get your previous theories as a special case of the more general framework. And so we have to

836
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,760
do the same thing. Our theory of conscious agents is a leap beyond evolutionary theory.

837
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:57,240
But we have to show how it projects back into space and time and gives us back evolutionary

838
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:04,120
theory as a special case. So I'm answering your question, but I also want to answer another question

839
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:07,800
that has just been published in Sintase, you know, the philosophy journal recently.

840
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:18,200
And I just want to point out that that argument just falls flat very easily. I'll stop.

841
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:27,080
Thank you. Can we move on? We have LeMond. LeMond, did you want to ask questions?

842
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:43,400
Hi, Donald. We've corresponded before. I think I'm probably one of your biggest fans on Clubhouse

843
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:49,320
here. I was wondering if you had had any correspondence with Neema Arkani-Hamed,

844
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:55,080
because I know that you're following what they're doing in high-energy physics really closely. And

845
01:23:55,160 --> 01:24:01,160
a lot of people have been, you know, begging Neema to, you know, write a book that's, you know,

846
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:06,280
more understandable for the general public, because I'm fascinated with the, you know,

847
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,280
decorated permutations and the amplitude hydrant. But it's so far over my head.

848
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,720
Could you provide any resources on how to really get a grasp on what that means?

849
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:23,320
Right. So I would love to talk with Neema. I haven't yet. And I'm hoping to actually get

850
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:28,600
to a place where I'll be worth his time. So I'm trying to, you know, the work I'm doing on these

851
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:33,640
trace chains and so forth. The decorated permutations stuff and the mark of chains onto it, I think

852
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:37,640
already might be of interest to him. But I want to push this a little bit further. His time is very

853
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,520
valuable. When I talk to him, I'd like, if I get the chance to talk to him, I'd like to really have

854
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,920
something that'll be of interest to him. But if you want to see more details, a little bit more

855
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:55,640
accessible about the amplitude hydrant and the decorated permutations is, of course, at Harvard

856
01:24:55,640 --> 01:25:02,600
that he gave in the fall of 2019. So if you Google, Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One,

857
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:10,280
you will find on YouTube, they post it all 20 something 25, 20, whatever it is, lectures.

858
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:15,720
So Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One, you'll see that he has an introductory lecture.

859
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:21,960
And he really lays it out in the introductory lecture. He tries to be fairly non-technical.

860
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:26,920
It's for a graduate class at Harvard. So, you know, non-technical for them might be technical for

861
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:33,640
the rest of us. But it's fairly accessible. And that's probably, I would say, his class and all

862
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,680
the lectures are online. That's maybe the most accessible source you're going to find right

863
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:45,960
now is his Harvard lectures. And I've studied, I've been studying his lectures. I've actually

864
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:51,960
transcribed 15 of them, all his first 15 lectures. I've transcribed myself personally,

865
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:58,680
equation by equation, figure by figure. I did that until COVID stopped me. COVID took me out.

866
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:05,560
But I plan to get back to it now. I'm starting to recover from COVID and go back to it. But yeah,

867
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:09,720
I'm really trying to study Neema's stuff. And, you know, I'm not a physicist.

868
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,000
I work with physicists. And at some point, we would love to talk with them.

869
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:23,960
Thank you. And we move on to Willie. Wonderful. Thank you, Ivy. And thank you

870
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:30,680
to have this great minds in the same room and watching your conversions at some point.

871
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:37,960
And I have two questions for each of you, one question. And it's definitely fascinating what

872
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:45,640
you are doing, God. And I say the first thing that great jumps in science are often company

873
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:52,440
of a big flock of people who don't understand what the new perspective is. So I'm also confused

874
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:58,680
sometimes by the combination of metaphors and mathematical apparatus and all this.

875
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:05,480
It's in the making, definitely. And I will take it for granted that you imply kind of

876
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:14,200
anti-realism with your stance. And I don't want to discuss it. What I want to see, if I get it right,

877
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:22,200
is that you are letting go reality and space time in a way. And starting with the fundamental of

878
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:30,120
conscious age. And we had a reading room here with these wonderful people from the

879
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:36,200
2014 article, The Origin of Time in Conscious Agents. And we found that it's a bit hard to

880
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:43,800
define or to go with you, what you mean. And it reminded me of the Floggy Stone story,

881
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,480
which is famous from Thomas Eskuhn about the structure of the revolution and Occup's razor

882
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:55,080
and so on. And we found out that we don't need Floggy Stone to understand that

883
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:03,880
heat is flowing from a hot point to a cold point. And so we let go Floggy Stone.

884
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:12,280
And I wonder how it can be in the same way let go reality and space time. Does it really make

885
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:20,200
sense? What are the practical and theoretical consequences in science and in life? And closing

886
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:27,240
here for your question, the old Leibniz introduced Monats in the same way as atomism just cannot

887
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:35,720
deliver the mantle. This was his basic intuition. It cannot deliver a series of emergence or

888
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:43,320
combination or composition just doesn't suffice to make us understand how this should ever work.

889
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:51,080
So I understand to go back to the primacy of the mild, definitely. But what are the predictions?

890
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,360
Is it detectable? Are you working on a kind of

891
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:01,800
operationable and kind of a detector, so to speak, that you can say now we can

892
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:08,680
here really see that here's a conscious agent. Sorry, it's in space time somehow,

893
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:15,080
but we can detect it and then we can count it just as an example. And then we can even see

894
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:21,240
how they emerge together or cooperate together and let time emerge. Something like this would be

895
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:27,560
very ambitious, of course. And should I go to Michael or should I just wait for you?

896
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:33,640
We really got to Michael first, because Michael got to live in time and it's time to

897
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:44,120
sort of succinctly ask your questions. So for me, also you, contrary to what Descartes was doing,

898
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:51,240
Descartes tortured cats saying that they are not sentient beings, they are just machines,

899
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:57,240
don't worry. And now we have inflation of consciousness and inflation of conscious

900
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:03,160
ancients, contrary, for instance, to even Thompson, who is preferring biopsychism,

901
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:10,840
psychism to panpsychism, only biological stuff like maybe even plants might have consciousness.

902
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:18,200
And now my question is, because you are also coming from a series of process structure like

903
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:24,760
autopoiesis in a way, but I guess you're going in a different direction. You're going into this

904
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:32,040
bioelectricity pattern. Here's my question. Are you looking for a substrate where the

905
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:39,000
self then is emergent? Because you're using the term emergent and have a different,

906
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:47,960
you have a different ontology, contrary to Don, because you are starting quite with common sense

907
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:53,960
that you are observing nature like Aristotle, Newton, Gallier, and so on. And then from this on,

908
01:30:53,960 --> 01:31:01,640
you are constructing theories. And yeah, you say, I start with reality in a way, or do I get you

909
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:07,640
wrong? And the last thing, and this is again, to both of you, are you actually waiting for a new

910
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:17,160
physics, which might be even produced by Donald? Yeah, this is very exciting, because maybe this

911
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:23,800
comes together. So thank you for both of you for your answer. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm not

912
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:31,080
sure I will be able to hit all of that, but I'll try to get to some of it. The first thing I should

913
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:41,000
say is that I'm in an enjoyable position here, where on this panel, I'm not the most sort of

914
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:50,200
avant garde person here. So Don has gone further. My stuff is a little more mundane. I have not

915
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:56,520
really said anything about consciousness. I don't know anything about any new physics. I haven't

916
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:01,320
really gone there, although I'm in complete agreement with Don's view of it and where he's

917
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:08,360
going with it. I have a somewhat less ambitious thing, which is that I'm interested in cognition.

918
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:17,400
Cognition is not the same as consciousness. Cognition is, and I sort of get into this in

919
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:25,000
excruciating detail in this last tamed paper, what exactly I mean by cognition. But to address

920
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:33,640
your first point, I do think that there's way more of it, not less of it than, for example,

921
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:39,240
Descartes might have thought. I think it's actually extremely prevalent in the universe. I don't

922
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:45,320
think it is limited to things that we would call alive. I'm actually not sure what we mean by alive

923
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:49,720
necessarily, and I don't spend any time trying to figure out what this category is. Other people do,

924
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,960
and that's great. I spend all of my time thinking about cognition, not life, because I think there

925
01:32:53,960 --> 01:33:03,560
are many things that are importantly cognitive that we may or may not call life. So that's

926
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,400
and I have this, and B is that I have this functional framework, it's called TAME,

927
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:15,880
which is technological approach to mind everywhere, that basically it's a very engineering

928
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:22,600
kind of approach that seeks to show you what exactly are the practical benefits of

929
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:28,600
odd cognitive lens. So it's very important to me that this is not just philosophy, that this is

930
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:35,320
all of these views are supposed to drive new discoveries, new research programs, so half of

931
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,560
my lab takes this stuff and turns it into interventions for biomedicine, for cancer,

932
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:43,400
for whatever, because this is not just supposed to be, well, you can look at it this way, or you

933
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:48,840
can Occam's razor it and just sort of do the science. That's actually not true. This way of

934
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,920
thinking about this gives rise to new experiments and new capabilities that we didn't have before.

935
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,280
And maybe at some point, consciousness will be folded into that. I haven't done that yet,

936
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:04,600
and so I make no claims whatsoever about consciousness yet. But I do think that

937
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:19,240
this view of basically dropping our teleophobia, we've developed through the early stages of

938
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:25,080
science this really weird fear of talking about goals and the systems that pursue goals.

939
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:29,080
And I think we need to dump that. I think that leaves so much on the table when we pretend that

940
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:36,440
doesn't exist. Since the 40s and cybernetics, we've had good theories of how you can have

941
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:41,960
non-magical goal pursuing systems. So I think it's time to kind of give up our fear of that.

942
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:49,400
And once you do that, really interesting examples of novel research programs come to light.

943
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:54,680
And bioelectricity, I think you mentioned bioelectricity. So bioelectricity happens to be

944
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:01,640
my favorite kind of cognitive glue for cells into larger systems, but it is not the only one.

945
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:05,560
I don't think it's magic. I don't think it's the only game in town. I'm sure there are other

946
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:10,840
mechanisms that play the same functional roles and who knows other places in the universe what

947
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:17,640
substrates play that role. But here on earth, what evolution has done is really exploited

948
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:23,640
bioelectricity and shown us how you can use certain features of physics and computation

949
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:29,640
to scale up cognition from very primitive goals of homeostatic little tiny systems all the way

950
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:35,480
up through human level, massive cognitive light cones. So I love bioelectricity, but it is certainly

951
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:42,920
not the only game in town for that. Thank you, Michael. Can we give a massive thank you to

952
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:50,040
Professor Levin because Professor Levin would have to leave now. So a massive thank you to

953
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:55,720
Professor Levin, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. Great to see you, Don.

954
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:58,760
Awesome to be able to discuss this. And thanks, everybody. Thank you for your questions.

955
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:03,640
Great to see you, Mike. Thank you. See you soon. Thanks. Right. See you soon. Thank you.

956
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:11,080
Thank you. So I'll respond to the question as well. So first, the notion of reality, I would

957
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:20,520
distinguish two kinds of reality. You might say something is real if it exists, even if no one

958
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:29,640
perceives it. That would be what you might call objective reality. But that wouldn't apply to

959
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:36,200
my headache. So suppose I have a headache. Well, that headache sure seems real to me, but it would

960
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:41,720
not exist without someone perceiving it, right? So the notion of objective reality doesn't seem to

961
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,880
catch my headache. And if you told me my headache wasn't real, I'd be very crossed with you. I mean,

962
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:51,960
it's real to me. So I'll distinguish between objective reality versus subjective reality in

963
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,480
that sense. And then what I'm saying is that we thought that space, time, and physical objects

964
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:02,680
like the sun and the moon are objective reality. And all I'm saying is, no, they're a different

965
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:06,920
kind of reality. They're subjective reality. We thought that they were objective reality,

966
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:14,680
but no, they're subjective reality. And I think quantum theory, the Nobel Prize in physics last

967
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:21,480
month was awarded to three researchers who have done empirical work showing that local realism

968
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:27,720
is false. And basically, what I'm saying is local realism is false. These things are all

969
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,560
subjectively real. They're there when you observe, those properties are there when you observe,

970
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,400
and they're not there when you don't observe. They're subjectively real, but not objectively

971
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:41,880
real. So now in terms of lightness, yeah, lightness, brilliant work in monodology,

972
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,880
and, you know, he had the analogy of the mill where he understood the hard problem of consciousness

973
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:52,120
and dismissed it in one paragraph. He knew that you couldn't boot up consciousness from

974
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:56,360
physical systems. And it was so obvious to him he didn't think it was worth more than one paragraph

975
01:37:56,440 --> 01:38:04,040
of his time to spend on it. And I agree. And so he then proposes the monodology and the

976
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:12,040
monads. And he basically says we need to start with two things, experiences and probabilistic

977
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:18,920
relationships among experiences. And I agree with lightness again. That's what we've done in our

978
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,320
model of consciousness. We basically model experiences and probabilistic relationships

979
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:31,720
among experiences. So lightness was there 300 years before me. And his notion of pre-established

980
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:38,280
harmony, that I think we're going to be able to model that in the way I was talking about earlier,

981
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:43,880
where I have like a big Markovian kernel for a big conscious agent. And when I take its trace

982
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:49,480
chain, there's two to the n trace chains, those are two to the n conscious agents that are all

983
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:53,480
interacting. It'll look like a pre-established harmony because they're all part from this one

984
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,240
big, now I can't do the trace chain on the one big conscious agent, the ultimate one. I can't do

985
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:04,040
that just because, well, Apple hasn't built a big enough laptop for me yet. But so you need to

986
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:09,960
you know, go to all of Cantor's hierarchy infinity. So Apple has a little bit of work to do ahead

987
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:15,400
for that. So we can't do that. But I sort of concede the notion of pre-established harmony

988
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:21,320
coming out of this. But it's also very useful for me to talk about conscious agents interacting in

989
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,920
non-trivial ways as independent agents looking at their interactions. So I mean, ultimately I think

990
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:33,000
lightness is right, but I think this other perspective is useful, given that we can't

991
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:39,240
actually model the one itself. And finally, in terms of what kinds of testable predictions,

992
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:47,960
that's what I'm working on this year. I want to, I'll be writing a paper in

993
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:55,160
in terms where we try to show that we can predict precise part-on distributions

994
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:03,080
for protons from a theory of conscious agents. So the proton, as everybody knows, is one of the

995
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:08,760
fundamental parts of the nucleus of protons and neutrons, the nucleus of atoms. The proton itself

996
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,960
is one of the most complicated things humankind has ever studied. It's not a trivial little ball,

997
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,960
and it's not just three quarks. You see three quarks, two up quarks and a down quark,

998
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:27,480
at sort of low spatial resolution, Bjork and X and low temporal resolution, Q squared. But as you

999
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:31,960
increase your spatial and temporal resolution, you find at the highest resolutions, you see

1000
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:38,120
what they call a gluon C, an ocean of gluons that are appearing and disappearing. And then

1001
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:46,680
as you back off, and you sort of have larger temporal scales, less temporal resolution,

1002
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:52,760
then you start seeing quark, anti-quark appear or disappear. So you get this quark C, and then

1003
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:59,160
finally at the crudest scale, you see the three quarks, and then some other quarks that are

1004
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:05,560
appearing and disappearing. So they have momentum distributions for all Bjork and X and all Q

1005
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:13,880
squareds. And I want to show that we can get all of those as artifacts of the spatial and temporal

1006
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:20,680
windows of our trace chain. In other words, these particles and their properties that we're seeing

1007
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:26,120
at the colliders are not an insight into a fundamental reality. All of the particles and

1008
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:32,200
all of their properties are artifacts of the spatial and temporal resolution of trips by

1009
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:39,080
conscious agents in their observations. So again, I could be wrong, but you're asking for a

1010
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:45,240
prediction. So the thing about predictions is you can be wrong. So this is the prediction

1011
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:52,440
that we're going to try to make, and we'll see where it goes. Thank you, Don. Maron, next. Great,

1012
01:41:52,440 --> 01:42:02,760
thank you. Thank you very much. Good to see you, Professor Hoffman. I have a question about the

1013
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,800
problem of perception. So under the free energy principle, perception has been defined as

1014
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:17,720
finding the most likely explanation or the most likely value for a hidden variable, given the

1015
01:42:17,720 --> 01:42:25,000
current observations that, say, we have five sensory inputs, and at time t, we are receiving

1016
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:33,080
five different sensory inputs through those five channels. And given that, I'd like to

1017
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:40,520
predict the most likely explanation for a hidden variable that has probably caused

1018
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:49,640
those sensory inputs. Especially in artificial intelligence, when we want to create smart AI

1019
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:57,000
models, particularly deep learning models, we are talking about a hierarchical structure of layered

1020
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:05,080
neurons. And one of the reasons that we do that, which is also similar to what they do in predictive

1021
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:13,560
coding networks, is that we are having a hierarchical structure of neurons so that we might be able to

1022
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:23,960
infer the hierarchical sequence of, you know, links of causality behind, what is it, like in the

1023
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:30,200
world out there that might have caused these sensory inputs, sort of model the hierarchical

1024
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:35,080
structure of God knows how many hidden variables and the way they're connected to one another.

1025
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:43,960
Now, if, first of all, I'd like to know whether you agree with this, like, would this be the right

1026
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:51,240
at least approach, in trying to understand the complicated hierarchical structure of

1027
01:43:51,240 --> 01:44:01,240
hidden variables. And second of all, because, I mean, this way, it seems intractable to me to try

1028
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:09,080
and sort of, you know, model, you know, potentially many, many, many such hierarchical

1029
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:13,880
relationships to so that we could model the world around us because it's just too complicated.

1030
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,080
So these are my two questions. Thank you very much.

1031
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:22,520
Yeah, great, great question. So the idea of perception as Bayesian inference is, you know,

1032
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:29,640
have a long history in the field. I've done some papers on that myself. There's a book called

1033
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:33,160
Perception as Bayesian inference. So if you there is actually a book called Perception as Bayesian

1034
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:39,560
inference by edited by David Nill and Whitman Richards and Whitman Richards was my PhD advisor.

1035
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,040
And I have a paper in that book. So I'm very interested. And that's a 1996 book. So it's

1036
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:49,480
quite old now, but it's, I've been interested a long time in Bayesian inference models of

1037
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:54,760
perception. And I think that they're quite powerful. Most of my colleagues who are doing that are

1038
01:44:54,760 --> 01:45:00,120
assuming that space and time is fundamental reality and that we're, the Bayesian inference was,

1039
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:05,720
we're actually finding the true physical substrate behind our perceptions. And I think that that

1040
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:11,160
whole thing is that that interpretation of Bayesian inference is mistaken. And if you go to the,

1041
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:17,400
you know, predictive processing, predictive coding kind of thing and the work on Bayes Nets,

1042
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:28,360
for example, and the implications there, what you see is the nodes inside a markup blanket

1043
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:32,360
appear to be doing this kind of, you know, Bayesian estimation.

1044
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,280
Whenever I say something that sounds like Siri, Siri on my phone starts,

1045
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:44,040
anyway. So, but, but, but here's the key thing that, that, that we know about Bayes Nets.

1046
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:50,440
The, even though it looks like the nodes on the inside are doing some kind of Bayesian inference

1047
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:57,480
about the world states, we know that the states of the nodes on the inside and the states of the

1048
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:04,600
nodes on the outside of the markup blanket are conditionally independent, given the state of

1049
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:13,000
the markup blanket. That means the only thing that the nodes on the inside can never, can ever

1050
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:20,360
know about the external world is the information on the markup blanket. So that whole framework tells

1051
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:26,760
you that you're only seeing an interface. The markup blanket is your interface and you're not,

1052
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:31,320
when you're doing this predictive processing, you're not predicting, you're not estimating the

1053
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:35,960
true state of the world. You're doing something on an interface and you're using only interface

1054
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,320
variables. So you never see the truth and you're not estimating the truth. And it's just right

1055
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:46,840
there in the actual, you know, the fact that a markup blanket is the set of nodes that makes the

1056
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:50,840
internal nodes and external nodes conditionally independent. That means you can't know anything

1057
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:56,920
more about the external nodes, except what you see on your markup blanket. So, so it just really

1058
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:00,680
highlights what I've said from Evolution of a Natural Selection and what the physicists are

1059
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:07,720
telling us. Not fundamental. Evolution tells us it's just an interface and so does the markup

1060
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:14,680
blanket. It tells you it's just an interface. So they all agree. Thank you very much. Thank you,

1061
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:22,760
Don. John, did you have any questions for Don? Thank you, Ivy. Yeah, I, the one thing I guess I,

1062
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:34,920
as a physicist, I confess, I, the one part, I like, I love your Windows interface analogy,

1063
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:43,560
you know, and I, and I think that's really powerful. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry, not doing,

1064
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:51,880
but I feel like, I feel like I can't quite make the leap to, you know, my experience in the world.

1065
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:58,520
And so for instance, the things that I have trouble with is kind of extending that to the idea that

1066
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:04,520
I can both see things and feel things and I can travel to those things that I see and touch them

1067
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,640
and other people can too. And they have the same experience. And I don't know, maybe I'm,

1068
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:17,080
I just feel like I'm missing something there. And I wonder if you have anything to help me over that.

1069
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:27,160
Sure. Sure. I think, I think the virtual reality metaphor is a big, big help here. So for people

1070
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:34,120
who are playing multiplayer, so multiplayer VR games. So I'm, I'm playing with somebody in China

1071
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:39,080
and, you know, in Germany and in Argentina, we're all playing Grand Theft Auto together.

1072
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:44,040
And we can all agree that, oh yeah, I, you know, Hoffman is racing against a red Porsche and the

1073
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:49,560
red Porsche is, you know, is 20 meters ahead of Hoffman. And we all agree. So we have consensus.

1074
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:54,120
And, and, and they might be giving me advice. You say, you know, Hoffman, you do a hard left there,

1075
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:59,160
there's a shortcut, you can beat him, something like that. So we have consensus and it looks like

1076
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,000
there's this objective reality, but we know that there is no red Porsche anywhere. There's just

1077
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,960
some supercomputer and we're toggling bits. So, so when the physicists like Nima or Connie Hamid

1078
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:14,280
tell us that space time is doomed, right? That it's not fundamental reality. There, but they're

1079
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:19,160
going beyond, they're saying, okay, there is a reality beyond space and time. And by the way,

1080
01:49:19,160 --> 01:49:24,840
beyond quantum theory. And but, but they're saying that quantum theory itself is not fundamental.

1081
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:30,760
So, so the new structures that they're finding, like the amplitude, there are no Hilbert spaces there.

1082
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:41,000
But the apple to Heaton is this high dimensional geometric object with facets and faces and edges

1083
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,840
and vertices. And it turns out that the properties of space time and quantum theory, locality and

1084
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:54,840
uniterity are coded in the face structure of these geometric objects beyond space time. So, so, so

1085
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,000
this is so the physicists themselves, and this is only in the last 10 years. So most, by the way,

1086
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:05,880
I was at a conference on consciousness, just a couple months ago, where a number of physicists

1087
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:10,680
who are quantum theorists, so they're their PhDs in quantum theory. And they're looking at

1088
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:15,080
consciousness. At the end of their talks, every one of them I asked, now, are you aware of these

1089
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:19,560
structures beyond space time, the amplitude, hedron and the decorated permutations, and to a

1090
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:26,040
person, they had never heard of it. Now, now, now, the reason is, is this is high energy physics,

1091
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:32,120
right? Only people who are in high energy physics, right, know about this stuff. And, you know, so

1092
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:36,280
why does a cognitive scientist know about it? Well, because I knew I needed to look for something

1093
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:41,000
beyond space time. So I've been looking for physics beyond space time. And when I found Nima,

1094
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,600
Arkanian, and their work, I realized, okay, okay, the other ones that would be doing it, they're

1095
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:50,200
the ones that are pushing the envelope with the highest energies, right? They're the ones

1096
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:56,920
that are going there. So it's, and it's Nima who's saying quantum theory is doomed, not just

1097
01:50:56,920 --> 01:51:02,200
space time, but quantum theory, that both of those are going to arise together. Because if you think

1098
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:08,200
about it, the particles, right, some people are trying to boot up space time from like entanglement

1099
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:13,720
of particles, right? But what are particles? Particles are irreducible representations of the

1100
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:19,160
Poincare group of the symmetries of space time. So you're not getting outside of space time,

1101
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:25,080
you're just staying in. So, so quantum theory does not get you behind space time. In fact,

1102
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:29,080
all the weirdness of quantum theory, the fact you need superpositions and collapse and all this

1103
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:36,680
stuff is a symptom of an interface. It's the fact that you've lost information in projection.

1104
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:41,080
That's why we get the weirdness of quantum theory and the no cloning theorem and all that stuff

1105
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:47,320
is all an artifact of space time not being fundamental. And there's this deeper reality.

1106
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:52,440
So now where physics is right now is, so the amplitude hydrant, so here's something for a

1107
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:59,240
physicist. If you do the scattering amplitude computation, say for two gluons smashing into

1108
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:03,800
each other, four gluons spraying out, you do it in space time using quantum field theory.

1109
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:10,280
There's hundreds of pages of algebra, nasty, nasty math. If you do it with the amplitude hydrant,

1110
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:16,600
three or four terms, you can compute it by hand. The math becomes trivial. Well,

1111
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:24,200
relatively trivial. It's all relative. But trivial compared to what you have to do with

1112
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:30,360
Feynman diagrams. And the other kicker is, you see new symmetries. There's something called the

1113
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:35,720
infinite Yangian symmetry that's true of the scattering, but you cannot see it in space time.

1114
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:40,600
You can only see it when you go beyond space time. So when the physics, when the physicists

1115
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:44,520
find that the math is getting simpler and you're seeing new symmetries, bye-bye space time.

1116
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:49,400
Well, I'll be sorry to see it go.

1117
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,680
Well, it's a wonderful headset. It's been a useful headset.

1118
01:52:55,240 --> 01:53:00,200
Thank you. Do you want to, do you know it?

1119
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:07,480
Yeah, very quickly, Donald, you didn't talk about the hard problems, consciousness. It seems to me,

1120
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:12,280
in fact, that that problem still remains as a problem because you essentially created a

1121
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:17,880
mathematical model of, you know, the effects of consciousness, not the consciousness, but the

1122
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:23,320
effects of consciousness, where the sentience, the sentience is coming into play in probably all

1123
01:53:23,320 --> 01:53:28,680
the way you're kind of portraying the reality. Can you just very quickly tell us something about

1124
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:34,440
this? Because I feel that experience is something that you cannot, you cannot convert it into any

1125
01:53:34,440 --> 01:53:40,840
kind of model. That is my view. Right, right. So the hard problem is that it comes up if you,

1126
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:43,960
if you assume the space and time are fundamental and you're trying to figure out how, for example,

1127
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:49,640
something like neural activity could cause conscious experiences. And there, I've got many

1128
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:54,200
friends and colleagues who are working in that direction and they're brilliant, but it's impossible

1129
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:59,560
to solve that problem. And the failure is clear. There's, you know, there's, for example, integrated

1130
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:03,080
information theory. What is the integrated information that must be the taste of chocolate

1131
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:07,960
or the smell of garlic? There's not a single one that they can do. Same thing with the orchestrated

1132
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:12,360
collapse of microtubules. There's not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain.

1133
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:17,000
And I predict I'd bet good money that they'll never be able to do it because it's just impossible.

1134
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:23,560
Lightness was right. It's impossible. So, so for me, I don't have the hard problem of consciousness

1135
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:28,040
because I'm not trying to boot up consciousness from non-conscious ingredients. I'm saying that

1136
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:32,760
that whole approach is wrong. So I've got the reverse hard problem. I have to, I have to show,

1137
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:37,240
if I start with consciousness, so I'm assuming consciousness, I have to show you how I give

1138
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:43,160
you physics in all detail. So I'm doing the reverse hard problem. And that's why I said my goal this

1139
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:49,320
year is to predict the parton distributions for all the quarks and gluons and so forth inside the

1140
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:54,200
proton. In other words, that's my reverse hard problem. So I agree that we need to solve it,

1141
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:58,840
but I have to go in the other direction. That one, I think, is feasible. And by the way,

1142
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:06,600
my current simulations are already very, very, they're, they're encouraging. At small temporal

1143
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:14,760
scales, I get a gluon C, a massless particle C appearing. And as I increase the temporal scales,

1144
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:21,640
I get a C of small, increase the temporal scale even more, I start getting bigger particles with

1145
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:28,280
greater math. So I get the, I've already in my simulations got the big picture now. But my goal

1146
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:32,920
is not just the big picture. I want to get the exact momentum distributions. But already, my,

1147
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:39,000
my current simulations tell me, you know, this is in a very profitable direction.

1148
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:45,000
Thank you, Dan. Can we move on to Ethan Prillock?

1149
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:46,120
Yeah.

1150
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:47,880
Go straight to your question, please.

1151
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:53,240
Yeah, well, we had asked it about Delbrook earlier. And I'm just curious about comments as to how

1152
01:55:53,240 --> 01:55:57,080
you have additions or subtractions or how similar it is. Thank you.

1153
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,880
Well, just briefly, I mean, Delbrook did a lot of things. So what specific idea about Delbrook's

1154
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:02,840
did you want me to comment on?

1155
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,080
Yeah, I mean, he talked about evolution, not really providing for something that we should

1156
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:15,160
expect to understand, you know, the fitness function as modeling, real underlying reality.

1157
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:21,640
So, so I'm not familiar with that. So he actually said that, that the notion of a fitness function,

1158
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:24,520
the fitness payoff function is not a useful tool, you're saying?

1159
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:29,000
He said it wouldn't really, we shouldn't expect it because of the way evolution works,

1160
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:34,520
to represent the underlying reality. But he didn't, you know, he didn't talk about it in terms of,

1161
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:38,360
you know, operating systems, of course, we didn't really have any of the potentials.

1162
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,960
Oh, I see. So you're saying that he was sort of agreeing with me that he was saying that

1163
01:56:42,760 --> 01:56:46,920
we shouldn't expect evolutionary grounds that we don't see reality as it is. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:47,640
Absolutely.

1165
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:51,800
And he was a student also of some of the great modern, he was a doctoral student of

1166
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:55,720
you, one or two of the great modern physicists before he became a biologist.

1167
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:00,760
Right. So, so yeah, and I think he was not a reductionist, and I'm not a reductionist either.

1168
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:07,240
So, so I, so I'll just say, yes, I agree with Delbroque on that. And he is absolutely my superior

1169
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:14,040
in terms of his knowledge of molecular biology. And then my other one quick question too is,

1170
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:18,120
in terms of the stuff that you were talking about these formalisms, is there anything that would,

1171
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:23,560
if we stay on the side of the Planck limits, that would make a demarcation about describing

1172
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:28,280
features of the universe in, you know, a prebiotic situation or a proto-ecology?

1173
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:31,960
And is there anything that would show something like that?

1174
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:40,440
Well, what I think is going to happen from the simulations I'm doing is that as I

1175
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:45,080
increase the windows, the spatial and temporal windows of the trace chains that I,

1176
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:50,680
that I do, I will get more and more complicated behaviors. And so I'm doing particles

1177
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:54,120
because that's the most trivial thing. I mean, I'm doing the physics is,

1178
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:58,200
it's going to be the easiest thing. And it's also where we have the most data, right? The

1179
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:01,880
physicists have been doing these scattering experiments for decades. And so we have tons

1180
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:07,320
of data. And so I'm not going after the physics because I think that that's the final thing or

1181
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:11,240
the most important thing is, it's the thing that you can do first. And you can get,

1182
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:15,400
but I eventually want to show how as we go to larger scales of these trace chains,

1183
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:22,120
we will then be able to see like the emergence of cells and organisms and greater organization.

1184
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:26,760
But that's more complicated. If I went after that first, I wouldn't have anything to report.

1185
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:32,520
I need to do the physics where we actually have a shot at getting a concrete result.

1186
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:39,160
Thank you, Don. Can we move on to Tony, please quickly? Yeah, it's going to be Don's last question.

1187
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:47,560
Okay. Let me try to add something useful. How you relate physics or fundamental physics,

1188
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:52,280
particle physics and consciousness. This part is still not clear to me.

1189
01:58:53,080 --> 01:59:00,120
Okay. So, so the, we just published a paper last week that you can take a look at it. It's

1190
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:06,120
called Fusions of Consciousness. So if you just Google my name, Donald Hoffman and fusions of

1191
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:12,600
consciousness, it's available free online and you'll read how we make the connection. But what

1192
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:21,160
I'll say at the top level is what we show in that paper is that communication or communicating classes

1193
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:30,760
of conscious agents correspond or what are being catalogued by decorated permutations.

1194
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:34,040
So the physicists found these decorated permutations beyond space time,

1195
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:38,360
these decorated permutations account for most of the data about scattering in space time.

1196
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:43,560
So we said, okay, if, if decorated permutations are the deepest thing the physicists have found

1197
01:59:43,560 --> 01:59:47,240
beyond space time, let's take our theory of consciousness and project it onto decorated

1198
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:53,800
permutations. And we did. So that's, so we introduced new mathematics, the mathematics that

1199
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:58,440
takes Markov chains and maps them to decorated permutations is brand new in our paper. So that's

1200
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:03,400
a new contribution as far as I can tell to mathematics. And that tells us now that particles

1201
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:10,360
in space time correspond to communicating classes of conscious agents. So that's, so that paper

1202
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:15,000
establishes that part in way we're clear in the paper, we're proposing that particles in space

1203
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,360
time are projections of communicating classes of conscious agents. So in the next paper that

1204
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:29,400
we're working on, I'm going to we're planning to now make specific mapping. So for example,

1205
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:35,240
what properties of communicating classes correspond to the mass of a particle? And there,

1206
02:00:36,120 --> 02:00:40,040
I mentioned earlier, so my proposal, and this is not published, so I'm telling you what we're

1207
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:46,040
working on. And if you can beat me to it, go ahead and publish it. That'd be fine. I don't

1208
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:49,400
care who publishes, I just want to read the papers. I just want to know this stuff. So,

1209
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:54,280
so I'm putting my ideas out there and someone who's a lot of people are smarter than me in

1210
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:58,200
this area. So you can run with it and I'll be happy to read your paper. What we're proposing

1211
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:08,840
is that the entropy rate of a communicating class corresponds to the mass. And the number of states

1212
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:17,560
in the communicating class will will lead almost immediately or momentum and wavelengths. So,

1213
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:21,080
so those are the things that we're looking at right now, but we're going to write up, we're

1214
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:27,160
writing a paper, tentatively called traces of traces of consciousness, where we use these

1215
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:32,440
trace chains and show how particles arise as artifacts of the trace process. And all of their

1216
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:38,520
properties arise like the they'll then be artifacts like the entropy rate of the Markovian kernel

1217
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:43,080
that happened to arise as an artifact of the trace chain process, that will be the mass that you see.

1218
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:49,720
So, so that's how I'm proposing to get physics. All of the particles and all the properties

1219
02:01:49,720 --> 02:01:54,760
are not fundamental reality, they are artifacts of the way we observe.

1220
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:00,680
Statistical artifacts and we're going to, and that's not just a hand wave, we're going to say now

1221
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:06,360
exactly what the statistics are and exactly how those properties emerge as the artifacts and why you

1222
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:13,400
get like bosons first and then only later does it condense into fermions and so forth. That

1223
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:20,840
that's all going to fall out of this, so. Thank you, Don. I have a very small question if I may.

1224
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:28,680
I will cry otherwise on stage. I'm sorry, Madej, we have to stop the interview now.

1225
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:36,360
Don, have to go. So, can we all give a massive thank you to Don for today, for his time, please.

1226
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,000
Don, thank you so much. It's been amazing. Thank you very much.

1227
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:47,240
Thank you, Don. Thank you so much. We'll see you later.

1228
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,200
Bye bye. Bye bye.

1229
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,800
you
