00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Welcome back to the Great Minds series. This evening we are diving into the fascinating

00:05.600 --> 00:12.400
world of consciousness with two incredible guests. First up we have Professor Christoph Koch,

00:12.400 --> 00:17.840
Divisionary Chief Scientist and President at the Allen Institute of Brain Science.

00:17.840 --> 00:22.480
Christoph has been at the forefront of neuroscience, shaping our understanding of

00:22.480 --> 00:28.880
consciousness with his work on the Neural Basis and Development of Integrated Information Theory,

00:28.880 --> 00:36.480
or IIT. Joining him is Bernardo Castro, a dynamic philosopher and computer scientist who is

00:36.480 --> 00:42.720
shaking up the philosophy of mind with his passionate advocacy for analytic idealism.

00:42.720 --> 00:49.920
Bernardo challenges us to rethink everything we think we knew about a reality and consciousness.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.360
Together we are going to explore the intersections of neuroscience, physics and philosophy,

00:55.360 --> 01:00.640
and maybe just maybe we all will leave with a deeper understanding of our own mind.

01:00.640 --> 01:07.120
So welcome Professor Koch, welcome Bernardo. Let's dive in and get this conversation started.

01:07.120 --> 01:14.400
So Christoph, I'm curious about the recent shift in your perspective on consciousness.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.360
You have long champion, you know, integrated information theory, which places

01:22.240 --> 01:28.560
consciousness within a strictly physicalist framework. Yet it seems that, you know,

01:29.440 --> 01:35.120
that a personal experience has recently shifted you towards embracing Bernardo's

01:36.000 --> 01:42.480
analytic idealism. So would you consider this as a turning point in your ontological view?

01:43.040 --> 01:48.000
Thank you. Thank you, Ivy. Well, I mean, first of all, let's just take a step back. So we're talking

01:48.000 --> 01:54.880
about consciousness experience. IIT takes a position that what exists first, primary,

01:54.880 --> 02:00.720
for itself, absolute existence is consciousness. So that is not a classical physicalist position.

02:00.720 --> 02:07.760
When you see IIT is firmly within the physicalist framework, that's not really true. It's closer to,

02:07.760 --> 02:13.520
I would say, lightness. You know, first and foremost, what exists is my own, is my consciousness,

02:13.520 --> 02:18.480
the only thing I know about. I don't know about atoms and black holes and viruses and all of that,

02:18.480 --> 02:23.040
I have to infer. I don't know about dogs and all of that. All of that I have to infer based on

02:24.240 --> 02:31.840
my observations and inference and scientific methods. And so IIT starts with consciousness and

02:31.840 --> 02:39.280
then tries to characterize what is consciousness and what is the substrate of consciousness,

02:39.280 --> 02:47.600
like a brain or computer. That is very different from the majority of theories, almost all theories

02:47.600 --> 02:53.600
in neuroscience, that do start with a brain. So they say, well, let's look at the brain and what's

02:53.600 --> 03:00.480
critical for consciousness. And I used to be like that when almost a more than a third of a century

03:00.480 --> 03:07.200
ago, I started work with Francis Crick, the molecular biologist who turned into consciousness

03:07.200 --> 03:12.000
researcher. And we said, well, there might be these oscillations, you know, that neurons fire

03:12.000 --> 03:18.880
periodically with a period of 50 times or 40 times a second. So this was called 40 hertz oscillation.

03:19.520 --> 03:25.200
And even if that would be true, it's like, you have to say, well, why 40 hertz? Why not 30 hertz?

03:25.200 --> 03:31.040
Why not 50 hertz? Some people say consciousness has to do with broadcasting of information in a

03:31.040 --> 03:35.840
global workspace in the brain. Well, then you have to explain why is it that broadcast and there's

03:35.840 --> 03:42.880
any broadcast responsible. So all these theories try to take the brain and try to squeeze the brain

03:42.880 --> 03:47.680
by saying, well, it's this function of that neuron or this area or that neurotransmitter.

03:47.680 --> 03:54.320
So they try to squeeze the sort of the mixing metaphysics here, the wine of consciousness

03:54.320 --> 03:59.760
out of the brain. And that, as David Chalmers pointed out, is a very hard problem. So IIT

04:00.080 --> 04:07.360
starts differently. It says what first mode exists. The only thing I'm sure of that exists is

04:07.360 --> 04:12.160
consciousness. Not when I'm in deep sleep, because then I don't exist for myself. I'm gone.

04:12.160 --> 04:18.560
Not an anesthesia, because then also I don't exist for myself. So it's important to make this

04:18.560 --> 04:25.440
clear. IIT is not physicalist. It makes prediction about the substrate. It makes some very sense.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.080
The substrate in the brain for consciousness has to be a maximum of cause effect power. You can

04:30.080 --> 04:35.760
compute that actually. It's very explicit. If you know a mechanism, if you can describe the

04:35.760 --> 04:41.840
mechanism like the brain or any other mechanism using it mathematically, it's called its transition

04:41.840 --> 04:48.160
probability matrix, then you can unfold its causal power to see whether it's conscious and what it

04:48.160 --> 04:54.240
is conscious of and how conscious it is using this number called phi, which is the number between

04:54.240 --> 05:01.920
zero when it's not conscious and something positive. But it also says the physical stuff is

05:01.920 --> 05:08.880
subvenient in a sense it has a lesser existence. My brain exists for others. My body exists for

05:08.880 --> 05:14.240
others, but consciousness exists for itself. So that's the difference between absolute existence

05:14.240 --> 05:22.800
of mind and derivative secondary, if you want, relative existence of stuff like atoms and brains

05:22.880 --> 05:25.280
and cars and shoes and ceiling works for others.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.840
So you don't think that it's a physicalist model then?

05:32.720 --> 05:39.920
No, it's not. In fact, we were attacked last year as pseudoscience. There was this big Twitter

05:39.920 --> 05:45.680
storm in Letters Britain to Nature and other journals because people said, well, it doesn't

05:45.680 --> 05:50.720
take this physicalist position. It starts out with consciousness and we can't describe that.

05:51.440 --> 05:57.680
You have to start with something concrete like the brain. No, we want, of course, the project

05:57.680 --> 06:02.000
is to identify what other neural footprints in the brain, which bits and pieces of the brain are

06:02.000 --> 06:10.160
involved in generating anyone, in constituting anyone conscious experience, but ultimately what

06:10.160 --> 06:19.040
exists is consciousness. Now, it's not a classical idealist position because unlike

06:19.040 --> 06:25.920
analytic idealism, it does assume that there is some sort of substrate, some sort of

06:25.920 --> 06:32.160
undifferentiated substrate out there that could, you know, made out of atoms and elementary particles

06:32.160 --> 06:40.880
and maybe, you know, quarks or whatnot, just some stuff. But we humans impose everything else

06:40.880 --> 06:46.640
that we see. When I look at this room here, I see refrigerator, I see oars on the wall, I see wood,

06:46.640 --> 06:52.880
I can look out, I can see the sun. All of those are products of my conscious mind because there

06:52.880 --> 06:59.760
are no oars in a universe devoid of the mental. There is no refrigerator, there isn't even a sun.

06:59.760 --> 07:05.760
All there is is undifferentiated stuff, very simple physical stuff that can that can take

07:05.760 --> 07:11.440
different states. But but everything else is a construct of our minds. It's a construct of

07:11.440 --> 07:19.600
consciousness. Thank you. So what is the implication then when you have these changes? You went to see

07:19.600 --> 07:26.400
Bernardo two months ago to speak about these changes in your model. So you spoke about the crack. So

07:26.400 --> 07:32.000
what is the implications of the crack then we want to know? Well, so I guess again, we have to step

07:32.000 --> 07:39.280
a little bit backward here for the audience. So yeah, last year, I had a mystical experience

07:41.760 --> 07:50.960
sitting on a beach at midnight under the midnight moon in which myself was gone. There was no more

07:51.040 --> 07:56.960
self, there was no more Christoph, there was no body, there was no surround, there was all gone,

07:56.960 --> 08:07.760
there was no world. What I asked, what I accessed, what I experienced, it's very difficult, you know,

08:07.760 --> 08:13.520
it's sort of called ineffable for a reason. It felt closest, if you remember, if you've ever

08:13.600 --> 08:21.120
read Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, when he talks of a mind at large, you know,

08:21.120 --> 08:28.400
when he had this mescaline experience in Los Angeles in 1948, he he he experienced what he

08:28.400 --> 08:35.200
called mind at large. And that was my that was my experience, I experienced that that's something,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.040
well, there wasn't an eye when I say eye, I meant whatever remained of my conscious entity,

08:41.040 --> 08:46.160
because there wasn't a me explain something, there was no more border or distinction between

08:46.160 --> 08:52.080
object, subject, apprehender, apprehended, no annoying. But, you know, I used the shorthand

08:52.080 --> 08:59.440
for items to describe this mind, this conscious mind, apprehended, it felt like it apprehended

08:59.440 --> 09:05.600
something universal, cosmic, all-encompassing. And that really left me, I mean, that night

09:05.600 --> 09:12.240
completely perturbed, I was completely perturbed by this, and it's really left sort of like,

09:12.960 --> 09:20.160
like an earthquake, where you feel, you know, at my age, you know, I'm 67 now, at my age,

09:20.160 --> 09:25.600
typically your ontology is pretty well firmly established by now, right? You know, you believe

09:25.600 --> 09:32.080
what you believe in whatever world you believe, so it's uncommon for this to be to have this,

09:32.720 --> 09:37.440
just like in an earthquake, where suddenly you realize that the ground you stand on isn't what

09:37.440 --> 09:45.520
it seemed to have been for the last 50 years of my life. So, I'm still processing, I'm still working

09:45.520 --> 09:53.200
through that and how that's, how I can reconcile that with what I know about consciousness and

09:53.200 --> 09:58.640
what it means for me and this project, my life-flagging project is to identify the

09:58.720 --> 10:04.320
footprints of consciousness in the brain and to build tools to test for the presence of consciousness.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.480
And that's probably, and maybe here Bernardo can say something,

10:09.040 --> 10:15.520
even on idealism, I think that project remains intact, because what I've realized over the

10:15.520 --> 10:22.480
last several years, that physicalism is not science. I mean, physicalism is used to justify

10:22.480 --> 10:28.720
science, but you can still do all the science you do without necessarily being a physicalist,

10:28.720 --> 10:34.720
right? You can assume, accept as an external world, it has caused us that I can study,

10:34.720 --> 10:39.840
I can manipulate them, they're lawful, they're lawful regularities, right? I can discover them

10:39.840 --> 10:47.360
and then I can exploit them for technological, you know, using technology for societal benefit.

10:47.360 --> 10:56.480
So, all of that remains intact while you may just give up this belief that ultimately what truly

10:56.480 --> 11:03.120
exists is a physical. And there are two more reasons I began to doubt physicalism, pure

11:03.120 --> 11:09.280
physicalism over the last five or six years. One is that physicalism is utterly failed to

11:09.280 --> 11:15.120
explain consciousness. Typically, what it does as a late, you know, Dan Dennett, the American,

11:15.120 --> 11:21.040
the Dorian of American philosophers who passed away 10 days ago, essentially argued using very

11:21.040 --> 11:26.560
fancy words and languages that consciousness is an illusion. It doesn't exist. You can totally

11:26.560 --> 11:31.680
eliminate it from public discourse and nothing would be changed, because there isn't anything,

11:31.680 --> 11:36.320
you know, there isn't anything particular, special, it's not like a substance or spirit or

11:36.320 --> 11:41.200
anything like that. It's a complete illusion. If you think you're in pain, pain is all about

11:41.280 --> 11:45.360
the behavior disposition, the, you know, if you have toothpaste, well, you know, you rub your

11:45.360 --> 11:51.120
jaw, you don't eat on that side of your mouth, you moan about it, but there really isn't anything,

11:52.240 --> 11:57.360
you know, about qualia. He famously said in this interview qual, in, within New York Times,

11:57.360 --> 12:02.800
qualia humbug. That's all nonsense, okay? However, I've written to him about it. If you

12:02.800 --> 12:08.880
actually have toothpaste, you know, this God awful toothache, nothing will be taken away

12:08.880 --> 12:13.200
by telling me, well, it's just an illusion. It's still as bad as ever. And I still see the world

12:13.200 --> 12:18.160
and I still hear the world. And if it's an illusion, it's the most profound illusion that we have all

12:18.160 --> 12:23.120
the time as long as we are conscious. When we are unconscious, we don't have this illusion anymore.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.840
So I think calling an illusion is just a complete failure. It's a complete cop out. It's trying to

12:27.840 --> 12:33.040
cancel consciousness. And I think what's now clear that that attempt to cancel consciousness using

12:33.120 --> 12:38.400
sort of classical physicalism, physicalism has failed, okay? B, at the rock bottom,

12:38.400 --> 12:43.440
it's really difficult to describe what the physical is, right? It used to be easy,

12:43.440 --> 12:48.000
you know, when it was still last century or the century before it was called materialism,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.920
okay, it's atoms. And we all know what atoms are. They're these little billiard balls and you could

12:51.920 --> 12:57.040
shoot at them and they're positive negative charges. But now it's getting much more complicated,

12:57.040 --> 13:01.280
right? We still don't have a final theory of consciousness. And then we have all the paradoxes

13:01.280 --> 13:06.480
of quantum mechanics that you can have a so-called bell state where you have, you know, two, let's

13:06.480 --> 13:10.960
say two photons that have opted spin or two particles was opted spin, they can be a light

13:10.960 --> 13:16.080
year away. They can be trillions of kilometers away, but they're still mysteriously entangled.

13:16.080 --> 13:21.520
Such as if I look at one, immediately, the one, the other one that the other end of the universe,

13:21.520 --> 13:26.320
you know, is, you know, flips the opposite, you know, determines its state is the opposite.

13:26.320 --> 13:32.640
Well, that's not physical. I mean, that sort of really defies any idea of what physical is.

13:32.640 --> 13:38.560
So we don't know how to define really fundamentally the physical. We don't know

13:39.840 --> 13:45.760
how to deal with consciousness. And then I experienced something where I felt this was some

13:45.760 --> 13:51.280
sort of universal mental entity. And so here we are.

13:52.160 --> 14:01.760
Thank you. So, Bernardo, you think that IIT could complement your analytic idealism?

14:01.760 --> 14:05.920
So could you elaborate on that? Because we have a lot of guests want to know how

14:05.920 --> 14:10.080
do you going to combine these two? Yeah, can I just make a couple of initial

14:10.080 --> 14:15.760
observations? Because these are things I feel passionately about. One is the same mistake you

14:15.760 --> 14:22.960
made interpreting IIT as eminently physicalist I made years ago in a paragraph in your writing.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.080
I already apologized to Julio Christoff and everybody else for that, corrected that in print.

14:29.360 --> 14:34.240
So I understand your mistake and your mistake comes from the fact that there are physicalists

14:34.240 --> 14:42.480
who use IIT to justify their views in a kind of emergent framework. That doesn't mean that IIT

14:42.640 --> 14:47.760
itself or the people working hard to develop it binds themselves to the limitations of

14:47.760 --> 14:55.680
physicalism which they don't. Another thing that it's not the first time I hear after the video of

14:56.640 --> 15:02.800
the discussion between me and Christoff was published is that somehow Christoff changed

15:02.800 --> 15:09.040
his mind completely. Well, I didn't witness that. What I witnessed is a scientist has a

15:09.040 --> 15:17.760
netifice of work built behind him but he continues to explore. He continues to advance his understanding,

15:17.760 --> 15:23.280
to investigate more questions and to allow his understanding to evolve. This is eminently scientific.

15:23.280 --> 15:29.840
He's not flipping, he's not turning, he's not abandoning anything. At least I didn't see that.

15:29.840 --> 15:36.880
Christoff can answer this question. That's not what I witnessed. And so these two misunderstandings

15:36.880 --> 15:46.080
are going around and I think we should colorify these. Regarding IIT, Christoff explained that IIT

15:47.680 --> 15:54.880
starts from experience. It doesn't necessarily say that experience is the ontological primitive.

15:54.880 --> 16:00.960
These are metaphysical inferences and hypotheses. But IIT takes experience seriously as something

16:00.960 --> 16:06.240
that really exists and is not merely an illusion or some kind of epiphenomenon. It's a starting

16:06.240 --> 16:13.840
point and there is a substrate. Is that contradictory with idealism? No, in analytic idealism you have

16:13.840 --> 16:20.000
both things. You have experience and you have a substrate. What idealism does as a philosophy,

16:20.000 --> 16:26.240
not a scientific theory, is to interpret what these things are in terms of their being.

16:26.960 --> 16:32.720
What is the substrate? An idealist would say the substrate is appearance and experience is the

16:32.720 --> 16:38.160
thing in itself. Experience is nominal, the substrate is phenomenal. One is the map, the

16:38.160 --> 16:43.760
other is the territory. But this is metaphysics. These are metaphysical inferences which IIT

16:43.760 --> 16:49.600
doesn't need to make because IIT is a scientific theory and it starts from what's available to

16:49.600 --> 16:56.000
observation. If you observe you see that there is a substrate whose states and dynamics correlate

16:56.000 --> 17:02.560
with the qualities of experience. This is a given. We observe this all the time and that's what we

17:02.560 --> 17:12.640
have to work with. In general, I don't think IIT is contradictory with idealism at all. I think

17:12.640 --> 17:20.400
they are complementary. I tell you why more specifically. I think IIT is the first scientific

17:20.400 --> 17:28.720
theory that gives philosophy the avenue of investigation to eventually create a theory

17:28.720 --> 17:34.960
of the nominal because all scientific theories are theories of phenomena, things that we observe.

17:34.960 --> 17:40.880
We don't have any theory of the things in themselves. IIT in the way it models how

17:41.520 --> 17:48.800
experiential states come together to form a sort of indivisible whole with certain experiential

17:50.160 --> 17:56.640
properties, so to say. That is the closest thing I think we have had in the history of human knowledge

17:56.640 --> 18:03.360
to something that one day could lead to a theory of the nominal. This is probably the most promising

18:03.360 --> 18:12.400
thing in science today and I don't say this lightly. IIT can, in a very natural way,

18:13.200 --> 18:18.080
offer an account of dissociation. We know dissociation happens because we know it empirically,

18:18.080 --> 18:22.000
but we don't have any model of dissociation. We don't know exactly. Can you explain what you

18:22.000 --> 18:30.320
mean by that? Dissociation is when you have, in the IIT terminology, you have two disjoint

18:30.320 --> 18:35.920
complexes. There is one thing that is like to be one mental complex and there is something else

18:35.920 --> 18:44.560
that is like to be another mental complex. They are not together. There are two centers of awareness,

18:44.640 --> 18:52.640
so to say, like two minds within that substrate. We know this happens to people. People can

18:52.640 --> 18:58.960
become dissociated. They can seem to be multiple different subjects. This is

18:59.920 --> 19:05.520
vastly documented in the annals of psychiatry and since the turn of the century with the

19:05.520 --> 19:11.760
advent of neuroimaging, we know that this is real. This is not something that people confabulate or

19:11.840 --> 19:19.280
invent to get attention and sympathy. We know it happens, but we don't know how it happens,

19:19.280 --> 19:25.520
what are the dynamics precisely, how it is triggered, why this illusion of

19:26.080 --> 19:34.560
separateness within one and the same mind arises. IIT, because of its starting principles and its

19:34.560 --> 19:43.280
information theoretical tooling, offers perhaps the only but certainly the best opportunity to

19:43.280 --> 19:48.160
come up with a conceptual model that accounts for dissociation, which is exactly what we need

19:48.800 --> 19:57.760
in idealism. I think IIT not only can complement idealism, it may even complete it as the very

19:57.760 --> 20:05.120
first theory of denomina in the history of human knowledge. Bernardo, can I add something to your

20:05.120 --> 20:14.000
comment on dissociation? Sure. The most dramatic case of that, and there's 30 years of research,

20:14.000 --> 20:19.200
including a Nobel Prize for Roger Sperry at Caltech behind it, is split brain. So in split brain,

20:19.200 --> 20:25.920
you take a brain, and we all know the brain has two hemispheres, the left and the right,

20:25.920 --> 20:31.920
and they're wired together using 200 million fibers called the corpus callosum. They connect this

20:31.920 --> 20:37.120
fiber bundles, think of it like a bus connects the left and the right brain, and in cases of

20:37.120 --> 20:41.040
severe epileptic seizure, this still happens occasionally today, they have to be cut.

20:41.920 --> 20:49.760
Under some conditions, you can see that now there are two minds, two conscious minds in this one

20:50.480 --> 20:55.440
brain, but each mind has their own hemisphere because now they're separate,

20:56.080 --> 21:02.480
and they don't know about each other. One mind may as well be on the dark side of the moon for

21:02.480 --> 21:08.960
the other one. The left hemisphere, if you talk to this person, that's the person you talk to,

21:08.960 --> 21:14.960
and that's the mind that you speak to, that's a public mind, but you can shut up that public

21:14.960 --> 21:23.920
mind, for instance, by injecting sodium amethyl, they'll briefly quiet the left hemisphere and

21:23.920 --> 21:28.800
then you can access the right hemisphere. That typically doesn't speak, it can sing, it can answer

21:28.800 --> 21:33.920
simply, yes, no question. So here you have a beautiful instance where you have two separate

21:33.920 --> 21:41.040
substrates, two separate complexes, as IIT would say, in one brain. And what you're saying,

21:42.000 --> 21:47.360
Bernardo, that this can also happen under these psychiatric cases known as dissociation,

21:47.360 --> 21:54.320
identity disorder, where you have two or even more, where there's a possibility that simultaneously

21:54.320 --> 22:00.960
you have two or more substrates in one brain, but one brain now that doesn't have the obvious

22:00.960 --> 22:10.960
200 million fibres cut. So I have a question, Professor Koch. So could we achieve a complete

22:10.960 --> 22:18.000
disassociation where the mind operate in what might be called a counterfactual space

22:18.720 --> 22:25.840
without tying itself to any specific temporal property? Could that be computational?

22:26.800 --> 22:34.400
No. So according to IIT, consciousness, mind is not a computation. It's not a process.

22:35.120 --> 22:40.480
It's not a clever hack. So there's no way, it's not a computation. It's not an app,

22:40.480 --> 22:44.880
you know, computation being an abstract symbolic mapping from one state onto another state. It's

22:44.880 --> 22:51.680
not like that. This is also the deeper reason why LLM's large language models will not be

22:51.680 --> 22:59.760
conscious, at least as if they run on current digital computers. Because it's not, you actually

22:59.760 --> 23:04.800
have to, if you want to replicate the human consciousness, you have to build something

23:05.360 --> 23:13.120
in the image of a human brain, what's called neuromorphic engineering. For the same, I mean,

23:13.120 --> 23:16.960
for a similar reason why it doesn't get wet inside a rainstorm, you know, you can perfectly well

23:16.960 --> 23:21.600
simulate a rainstorm, but it doesn't get wet inside the computer. You can simulate nuclear

23:21.600 --> 23:26.000
explosion. People at Los Alamos do it all the time, but you don't have to be afraid that your

23:26.000 --> 23:31.920
supercomputer is going to melt with radioactivity. You can simulate the black hole at the center

23:31.920 --> 23:37.280
of our galaxy, but you don't have to be afraid that if you turn on the run button of the simulation,

23:37.280 --> 23:41.520
suddenly there'll be a black hole in your computer because it's just the simulation.

23:42.160 --> 23:48.480
Same thing with consciousness, no matter what mind is associated or not. Consciousness is not

23:48.480 --> 23:53.920
a computational property. It's something, in a sense, it's causal power. It's the ability to

23:53.920 --> 24:03.120
affect change. And for that, you need some sort of underlying mechanism and that you can't simulate.

24:03.120 --> 24:08.800
I mean, you can perfectly well simulate the behavior of this mechanism. And this mechanism,

24:08.800 --> 24:13.360
if it's good enough, like an LLM will, of course, claim it's conscious, but it's all a deep fake.

24:13.360 --> 24:21.200
It will never feel like anything. Because there is a state, Professor Koch, there is a state that

24:21.840 --> 24:25.680
quite a lot of practitioners, somebody that claimed that they're awakened,

24:26.320 --> 24:36.720
so that he's the state of lucid, dreamlessly, they're aware lucidly that having no dream,

24:36.720 --> 24:41.600
but they know that they're sleeping. There is such a state. Do you think that that can be

24:41.600 --> 24:49.280
investigated? Can be... Yes, people are doing it. Yes. Yeah, there are a number of lab that are,

24:50.000 --> 24:54.880
so even within the Eastern tradition, there's, of course, dream yoga. And some people are now

24:54.880 --> 25:00.160
trying to study dream yogis, you know, people who do this routinely, who use the power of their mind

25:00.800 --> 25:07.680
to control their own dreams, you know, within a Buddhist tradition. But there are a number of labs

25:08.800 --> 25:15.040
that I know that study lucid dreaming, which is this peculiar state where, as you mentioned,

25:15.040 --> 25:22.640
you wake up inside your dream without waking up the brain. So you're still in REM state,

25:22.640 --> 25:26.560
but you can to a certain extent control your dream. And the question is, it's now being

25:26.560 --> 25:33.440
investigated experimentally. Can you do this to help you therapeutic? Can you do this, for example,

25:33.440 --> 25:40.400
when you have PTSD to ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD or depression? And there's some very

25:40.400 --> 25:46.720
encouraging data to suggest that might be the case, that if you can artificially put people into the

25:46.720 --> 25:52.960
state, let's say using certain types of anesthetics, where they're not fully anesthetized, but there

25:52.960 --> 25:59.520
are enough anesthetized, predated that they're in this lucid dreaming. Can the person, the dreamer

25:59.520 --> 26:07.120
themselves, then does it enable them to control their dream and to relieve symptoms of PTSD?

26:07.120 --> 26:11.040
And there are few at least very spectacular examples of this now in the literature.

26:12.240 --> 26:17.520
Yeah, because in Eastern literature, they're not propositional, they're not theoretical,

26:17.520 --> 26:24.240
but they have very in depth kind of like inquiry, like basically going inwardly,

26:24.240 --> 26:31.520
like what Bernardo is advocating, going inwardly to investigate using it as a tool to literally,

26:31.520 --> 26:37.520
you know, get into the epistemic agent. So there is a state that the yogi can get to,

26:37.520 --> 26:46.320
it's, they call it the epistemic openness. It's like your, your mental space, it's open for

26:46.320 --> 26:53.200
possibility, but there is no subject object at all. I have that state before, like you say,

26:53.200 --> 27:00.640
sometime when you are on sort of like psychoactive drugs, you have these center disappear, but

27:00.640 --> 27:11.360
this one is completely different. He has these a profound kind of like very intense awareness.

27:11.360 --> 27:17.600
It's like, it's like when we go to sleep, we wakes up that it has these

27:17.600 --> 27:25.920
cyclical element to it. It's like reentry point to after the sleep, it's like a reentry point.

27:26.560 --> 27:32.960
And once you're transitioning from the zero person perspective to the first person perspective,

27:32.960 --> 27:41.920
you have these ever fresh kind of like awareness. It's like weakfulness, I will call it is a very

27:41.920 --> 27:50.640
intense sort of like a fresh weakness. Yeah, I think that state is more primordial than

27:51.360 --> 27:55.840
a lot of the model you're talking about. So do you think that can be measured,

27:55.840 --> 28:00.880
can be investigated, Professor Ko? Can certainly be investigated scientifically,

28:00.880 --> 28:06.800
like you can put EG electrodes on people. And that's being done now in various labs on yogis

28:06.800 --> 28:13.280
that have these states. And you can see does this state, for instance, when they have, when they have

28:13.280 --> 28:19.600
loss of self, right? We know at least for certain types of meditation and for certain types of

28:19.680 --> 28:25.040
psychedelics, when you lose self, you know, LSD, for instance, ego dissolution, certain parts of

28:25.040 --> 28:30.080
your brain, particularly in the back of the brain, the posterior cingulate that they're

28:30.080 --> 28:37.360
involved in self, you know, so the brain is representations for the self. And, you know,

28:37.360 --> 28:44.480
both for the autobiographical self as well as for the experiential self. And if this activity is

28:44.960 --> 28:50.480
inactivated, either because you're doing a mind trick by your meditation training for many years,

28:50.480 --> 28:56.080
or because you're taking a particular type of medicine, you may you seem to have these states

28:56.080 --> 29:02.160
where you're highly conscious, but there's no more self, there's no more body, which I think is

29:02.160 --> 29:08.480
from a therapeutic point of view, very, very important to obtain this ego less state.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.600
In fact, I think many people report when they report these transformative experiences,

29:14.720 --> 29:20.480
this typically seems to involve ego. You know, the way I describe it, we always live

29:21.200 --> 29:27.360
within the gravitational field of the ego. Everything is always about me, me, me, and me.

29:28.240 --> 29:33.760
Everything I look out through my eyes, and I think either directly or indirectly, it's, you know,

29:33.760 --> 29:38.960
how does this relate to me? This is a danger to me. It's just good for me, etc. And of course,

29:38.960 --> 29:44.080
this ego can get really in the way and can be, you know, can really ruin your life. It's essential

29:44.080 --> 29:49.200
for doing long term planning, but it can also be profoundly dysfunctional. So losing it,

29:50.480 --> 29:55.120
and then realizing, well, the world is profoundly beautiful, right? The world still exists without

29:55.120 --> 29:58.480
the ego getting in the way. It's actually profoundly beautiful. I think can really be,

29:59.040 --> 30:05.520
can really be transformative for people. And yes, there's no reason why you, why you can't measure

30:05.520 --> 30:09.360
and people are measuring, you know, trying to measure these states, and can you do some

30:10.320 --> 30:15.200
somehow using some electrical stimulation. For instance, people are also playing around with

30:15.200 --> 30:22.240
that electrical stimulation or sound stimulation, other ways of obtaining this ego less, this

30:22.240 --> 30:30.320
selfless state without having to resort to 20 years of meditation training, which is not easy,

30:30.320 --> 30:36.480
or without taking, you know, psychoactive substances to propose this conversation for

30:36.480 --> 30:40.880
you to have a debate. But it seems like you both have worked together. There's no more debates

30:40.880 --> 30:49.760
to be debate about. Well, for instance, under to not totally lose the substrate, right? So one in

30:49.760 --> 30:56.160
one version, Bernardo of IIT, you can say what really I'm not, I don't make any ontological

30:56.160 --> 31:01.040
commitments regarding a substrate, whether it's physical or not. All I have is this operational

31:01.040 --> 31:05.760
assumption, there's a transition probability matrix. In other words, I can see something

31:05.760 --> 31:12.080
transistors, neurons, whatever atoms, and I can manipulate them. And then every time I'm in the,

31:12.080 --> 31:16.480
I'm, I manipulate this state, I observe that state over there. And I, you know, I do that

31:16.480 --> 31:21.360
exhaustively. So I get this transition probability matrix, right? And that's really all I need. I

31:21.360 --> 31:25.680
don't need to make an assumption what's the underlying, what, what, what is the underlying

31:25.680 --> 31:34.000
substrate? All I have is experience, and then a TPM. And then the question is, can this TPM,

31:34.000 --> 31:40.160
how does this TPM instantiate this experiences? How can it be the substrate for that particular

31:40.160 --> 31:46.080
experience? I don't know how you would call such a theory from a, from a metaphysical point of view.

31:46.800 --> 31:50.800
Well, you find the correlation. So the correlations are there, right? That's, that's a

31:50.800 --> 31:57.040
measurement fact. You measure that and tabulate those correlations. So there is something in nature

31:57.760 --> 32:03.760
that, that, that is correlating, because that's the measurements we make, whether the

32:03.760 --> 32:07.520
measurements are directly of something or representations of something. Yeah, that's a

32:07.520 --> 32:12.640
metaphysical question. But the correlations are there. So how would I interpret them?

32:14.560 --> 32:19.360
You know, this metaphor, I like a lot to the dashboard and an airplane, which is a representation

32:19.360 --> 32:26.480
of the states of the sky outside. In the new mental world, the world as the things in themselves,

32:26.480 --> 32:33.920
the world of the sky, low pressure will correlate with high humidity.

32:35.360 --> 32:40.560
So if the pressure of the air outside the airplane starts going down as the airplane flies,

32:41.360 --> 32:45.920
the humidity meter of the airplane will start picking up higher humidity,

32:46.960 --> 32:49.280
because low pressure just pulls the weather in.

32:49.920 --> 33:00.960
On the dashboard, what you would see is a little dial, needle dial, that, that is going down,

33:01.760 --> 33:08.640
the pressure is going down, and another dial that will go the other way, humidity is going higher.

33:08.640 --> 33:14.240
This is what we measure. One dial going down, the other, the other dial going up. So this is what

33:14.240 --> 33:20.160
we measure in the phenomenal world, the world of representations, the world of the dashboards.

33:20.160 --> 33:27.520
We do capture correlations that exist in the world as it is in itself, but we capture them

33:27.520 --> 33:33.040
through the intermediation of cognitive representations, because all we can measure are

33:33.040 --> 33:37.200
those, all we can measure is a dashboard, the substrate. That's how I would interpret it.

33:37.200 --> 33:43.120
But I agree completely with you that from the point of view of science, you do not need this

33:43.120 --> 33:50.000
interpretation, because science deals with observation, what is there for us to measure

33:50.000 --> 33:55.600
and then study, and maybe even predict and anticipate, and you don't need metaphysical

33:55.600 --> 34:02.640
guesswork to do that. The problem is that because we are humans, most of us cannot help,

34:02.640 --> 34:09.680
but try to interpret. And if you try to do that, then one has to be a little bit more judicious

34:09.680 --> 34:14.400
in doing that, but it's not required for the practice of science, I don't think.

34:15.600 --> 34:22.480
Agreed. Now, one difference is that under IIT, we have to actively, so you're saying you just

34:22.480 --> 34:30.400
correlate one state, you know, humidity with another state, pressure. Within IIT, those things

34:30.400 --> 34:36.560
have to be carvels. In other words, I go out, I mean, that's what we do in, not in astrophysics

34:36.560 --> 34:41.360
famously, of course, but in biology. We manipulate this neuron, or we give that drug, or we do

34:42.640 --> 34:48.240
that electrocone injection, and then we observe. So this is direct intervention

34:49.760 --> 34:55.840
that's necessary to fully describe this system using its transition probability matrix.

34:56.640 --> 35:05.280
Yeah, I think that is entirely valid. Some people think that there is a very easy way to

35:06.000 --> 35:10.480
contradict idealism, which is to say, if I take a needle, Bernardo, and stick it in your arm,

35:11.120 --> 35:16.880
you will feel the pain and recoil. So a physical cause produces an experiential effect.

35:17.600 --> 35:22.480
Therefore, the arrow of causation is from physical to experiential, and therefore experiential is

35:22.480 --> 35:29.840
phenomenal, or epiphenomenal and secondary, and the real world is physical. Under idealism, however,

35:30.800 --> 35:38.160
that needle going into my arm is a representation on a dashboard. It's not the thing in itself.

35:39.040 --> 35:44.960
That the pill with a psychoactive substance that I swallow is a representation on the

35:44.960 --> 35:51.360
dashboard. It's not the thing in itself. What is really going on is that there is a mental

35:51.360 --> 35:56.160
process out there in the world consisting of a certain number of mental states and dynamics,

35:56.160 --> 36:01.040
certain structure. And on the dashboard, that mental process looks like a pill,

36:01.760 --> 36:06.560
because the physical world is the dashboard under idealism. So when you swallow that pill,

36:07.280 --> 36:13.680
what you're doing is your, the set of your complexities under IIT, the sector of your

36:13.680 --> 36:20.400
mental processes is ingesting an external mental process, which will then react with your internal

36:20.400 --> 36:26.080
mental processes. And that will have an experiential effect. So under idealism, even the needle

36:26.080 --> 36:32.400
going into my arm, even the psychoactive pill that I swallow, those two are mental processes,

36:32.400 --> 36:38.240
which appear to us as physicality, because we measure them and represent them on our internal

36:38.240 --> 36:43.840
cognitive dashboard. So there is no implication that there is a causation from the physical to

36:43.840 --> 36:48.880
the mental. The causation is mental to mental, but some of these mental stuff can be represented

36:48.880 --> 36:54.880
as physical. That's how I would interpret that. So what is the nominal then, this thing testing

36:54.880 --> 37:02.800
and disease? What is that mental states? But now if we try to imagine what they feel like,

37:02.800 --> 37:07.680
what it is, what it is like to be a psychoactive pill, well, it's not even a separate

37:10.400 --> 37:19.280
in IIT terms, it's not even a separate complex, right? It's ontological dust. It's an aggregation

37:19.280 --> 37:27.520
of all kinds of tiny little complexities. So I don't think we can imagine what it is like to be

37:27.520 --> 37:35.360
the inanimate world out there without committing the fallacy of anthropomorphization, morphization

37:36.160 --> 37:43.280
immediately. It's something we have to think a little bit abstractly off, but not as abstractly

37:43.280 --> 37:48.320
as physicalism would have us think of the world. Because under physicalism, not only is it impossible

37:48.320 --> 37:54.080
for us to imagine what it is like to be the world, there is nothing it is like to be the world,

37:54.080 --> 37:59.760
which we cannot visualize because it's an absence of all visualization. So it's pure

37:59.760 --> 38:07.600
abstraction that is impossible to visualize. You can imagine that the real world out there,

38:07.600 --> 38:12.480
the inanimate world as it is in itself, as opposed to how it is represented physically,

38:13.200 --> 38:23.120
is a collection of mental processes and quality estates that we cannot really fathom,

38:23.120 --> 38:25.280
but there is still something it is like to be them.

38:26.240 --> 38:32.560
Yes, so taking that step, that sort of for a scientist, you know, study the brain for 40 years,

38:32.560 --> 38:38.240
that's a hard one. But it's because, you know, I literally, you know, when you get a big brain,

38:38.240 --> 38:43.040
you manipulate the brain, I understand you're seeing the brain is real as real as anything

38:43.040 --> 38:49.040
else. But ultimately, it's a mental state, right, that that manifests itself as something physical,

38:49.040 --> 38:53.040
bloody, weighing, you know, three pounds being covered with red.

38:55.600 --> 39:00.160
Of course, we all think like that. Of course, we all have that difficulty, because we are pilots

39:00.160 --> 39:05.920
that were born in that airplane cockpit without transparent windows. And all we have ever had

39:05.920 --> 39:10.320
is the dashboard. So we think in terms of the dashboard, of course, it's inescapable.

39:11.440 --> 39:15.600
I mean, I did really like your argument that it is much simpler. The only thing I know

39:16.720 --> 39:21.200
is phenomenal states. That's the only thing I directly experienced. So then you make this

39:21.200 --> 39:25.200
argument. Well, then isn't it easiest just to say beyond the horizon, everything is,

39:25.200 --> 39:30.880
is, is phenomenal. Isn't that by far the easiest assumption, rather than to say, well, I have to

39:30.880 --> 39:36.560
infer that it's this non non phenomenal state called physical. And I actually, everything

39:36.560 --> 39:42.960
consists of just physical things. That seems a more complicated assumption. But even under

39:42.960 --> 39:50.480
under IIT, for something to exist really, it must exist for itself. So if the external world

39:50.480 --> 39:57.520
exists really, then it too must exist for itself, even if it's just ontological dust,

39:57.520 --> 40:05.200
it must exist for itself. But as dust, right, not as a single conscious mental entity, it exists

40:05.200 --> 40:12.400
as gazillion of, of tiny, you know, minimal states, right, having tiny amount of integrated

40:12.400 --> 40:19.520
information. Could say it's one mind with gazillions of tiny dissociated complexities.

40:21.520 --> 40:26.240
Yeah, but so here it gets tricky because, you know, as you well know, I don't experience your

40:26.240 --> 40:32.880
mind and you don't experience my mind, right. And, and so why is it if there, if there's this

40:32.880 --> 40:39.040
universal mind, how do you know, why is it that we're separated? So the opposite problem of the

40:39.040 --> 40:44.080
PAMP site is combination problem, right? Why don't we all experience the same thing?

40:45.200 --> 40:53.600
If dissociation can happen in nature, then given enough time, it's bound to happen.

40:54.400 --> 40:59.680
If we go back in cosmology, instead of thinking of this very complex universe we have today in

40:59.680 --> 41:05.600
which there's a lot of structure, there are atoms and molecules, for instance, if we go back to

41:06.800 --> 41:14.720
shortly after fractions, small fractions of a second, very, very small fractions of a second

41:14.720 --> 41:21.920
after the big man, like 10 to the power of minus 32 or 33. It was uniform.

41:23.280 --> 41:31.120
Those, those quantum fluctuations that eventually led to, to dust and then to star formation and

41:31.120 --> 41:36.400
then planets, galaxies and galaxy clusters, all of that came later. It was all uniform.

41:37.280 --> 41:43.440
That is a known dissociated state. If you imagine that substrate without structure,

41:43.440 --> 41:48.480
blend in uniform, it's a non-dissociated state. And everything that happened afterwards

41:48.480 --> 41:51.680
happened because it could happen. So dissociation happened.

41:53.840 --> 41:59.840
These dissociation appear to be stable at least for tens of years or 100 years, right?

41:59.840 --> 42:03.680
Because for on a normal condition, unless you're psychotic patients,

42:04.320 --> 42:10.240
your mind and my mind is to stay with that will remain their own entities, right? Until they

42:10.240 --> 42:18.000
dissolve once the, once the brain dissolves, right? Yeah, I didn't make a differentiation between

42:18.880 --> 42:24.480
the natural dissociative state of ontological dust and the dissociative state of a living being.

42:24.480 --> 42:30.560
I think they are different. One is actively enforced by, by metabolism that keeps us sort

42:30.560 --> 42:35.440
of protected from the second law of thermodynamics for a while. And the other one is spontaneous.

42:35.440 --> 42:40.080
It's not actively reinforced. It just happens out there in nature. I think life

42:41.360 --> 42:48.320
evolved to be actively enforcing dissociation because the dissociations that survived and

42:48.320 --> 42:54.560
reproduced are the ones that actively enforce themselves. And the ones who didn't, didn't

42:54.560 --> 43:01.120
live long enough and didn't reproduce. So we try to maintain ourselves outside of

43:01.120 --> 43:08.080
thermodynamic equilibrium because we are the descendants of those dissociations that could

43:08.080 --> 43:13.200
do it. And I feel that because I've been, I'm there as well with you.

43:16.160 --> 43:21.760
When we have a transformative experience, which I had to not, not as compelling and

43:23.600 --> 43:28.400
your ability to describe it in your new book is just, I mean, it starts like a whirlwind.

43:28.400 --> 43:33.600
The first page is already, I don't have that, but I think I have had transformative experiences.

43:33.600 --> 43:41.600
We have this tendency of trying to think of the mind of nature as a sophisticated mind,

43:41.600 --> 43:48.480
somewhat like ours, but more and higher and better. And maybe that's right. I don't know,

43:48.480 --> 43:53.280
but I think from, from the point of view of pure reason and evidence as opposed to introspection,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.920
I don't think there is good enough reason to entertain that.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.200
Do you mean mind at large maybe relatively

44:04.000 --> 44:10.640
unsophisticated? I mean, I would, I mean, Schopenhauer had this argument that it's pure

44:10.640 --> 44:14.720
will, right? Which seems relatively unstructured, undifferentiated, right?

44:15.760 --> 44:21.200
He was very clear about that. Yeah. And I agree with him. Now, there are these mystics, you know,

44:21.200 --> 44:24.800
that go into these altered states of consciousness, which I take seriously,

44:24.800 --> 44:31.360
since that monk self-immolated around the time of the Vietnam War, I realized that, okay,

44:31.360 --> 44:36.240
there is such a thing as, as enlightenment. And they come back and say, well, Bernardo,

44:36.240 --> 44:41.600
things are not as simple. There is intelligence. It's a kind of instinctive, spontaneous intelligence

44:41.600 --> 44:46.640
without, you know, self-awareness and metacognition, all these higher level mental functions that we

44:46.640 --> 44:54.000
evolved. But it is, it is not just instead of ontological dust, it's not experiential dust

44:54.000 --> 45:02.720
at the nominal level. And I take it seriously, but I haven't experienced it. And I don't find

45:02.720 --> 45:11.360
today at this point in time, a avenue of argument based on reason and evidence that compellingly

45:11.920 --> 45:18.880
leads us to this conclusion. Maybe you will, Christoph, I couldn't.

45:20.480 --> 45:28.720
Yeah, all I have is my own one experience, which seemed, yeah, it was not, I mean,

45:28.720 --> 45:34.160
it wasn't a classical religious, it wasn't that Jesus talked to me or anything like that. I was

45:34.160 --> 45:40.720
literally universal, simple mind that I was all encompassing and included, you know,

45:40.720 --> 45:47.680
together with this vision of all these stars and galaxies. Very difficult to describe.

45:49.120 --> 45:55.600
I haven't quite had that, but I can smell what you're describing. I can feel the scent of it.

45:56.240 --> 46:01.600
Yeah. And so one question is, this also raises the question that I think you briefly alluded to

46:01.600 --> 46:08.240
in one of your books in the appendix, when, what happens when the brain ultimately dies,

46:08.560 --> 46:17.440
sooner or later, or brain will die, what happens then with the, does the associated mind, so clearly,

46:17.440 --> 46:23.760
I would say, and certainly according to IIT, the mind, that self with its memory will disappear

46:23.760 --> 46:29.840
and will be never more, unless you bring the same exact brains and connectivity and synapses

46:29.840 --> 46:37.760
together. But is it true in a sort of idealism that then just like a river, like a little,

46:37.760 --> 46:44.960
what do you call them, a little whirlpool in a river will dissolve and then become

46:45.520 --> 46:51.920
this part of the large, undifferentiated water? Is that what's likely going to happen?

46:52.800 --> 46:57.360
If we look at the substrate, what happens to the body when we die? Well, metabolism seizes,

46:57.360 --> 47:02.800
that's the definition of death, and then it decomposes and gets reabsorbed into its environment,

47:03.440 --> 47:09.760
which sort of evokes very much this notion of our inner life being reabsorbed into its

47:09.760 --> 47:17.840
cognitive environment, its cognitive context. I don't think, from a rational perspective,

47:17.840 --> 47:21.600
I don't think we have good reasons to think that personal agency survives death,

47:22.320 --> 47:25.920
because it's really correlated with the body. If the body's not there, what reasons do we

47:25.920 --> 47:33.920
think that personal agency remains? You could say under IIT that memories will also lose their

47:33.920 --> 47:40.640
coherence. The problem with that is empirical. If you look at what Michael Levin has been doing

47:40.640 --> 47:46.560
at Tufts, and I don't know whether you know his paper with the little planaria,

47:47.360 --> 47:52.720
yes, cut off the brain and they grow a new head and they remember what the brain was trying to do.

47:52.720 --> 48:01.680
It seems like the brain doesn't have, sorry, it seems like memories don't appear on the dashboard

48:01.680 --> 48:06.880
of representation, which is coherent. Not all representations need to be complete. The dashboard

48:06.880 --> 48:10.880
doesn't tell you everything there is to know about the states of the sky. So it could be that

48:10.880 --> 48:15.520
we miss out on some things, because evolution got us focused on what we call the present.

48:15.520 --> 48:21.280
That's where the opportunities and the threats are. And the past is water under the bridge.

48:22.080 --> 48:28.800
As we say colloquially. So it appears that we didn't evolve to represent what we call memories

48:28.800 --> 48:35.840
on the dashboard. And what that means is we don't know where they are. Michael's experiments seem

48:35.840 --> 48:40.880
to suggest they are not in the nervous system. And then you could speculate they may be somewhere

48:40.880 --> 48:46.000
in the body, maybe, but maybe they're not even in the body. So I don't know.

48:46.320 --> 48:51.040
All right. I mean, here again, my neuroscientists take over and certainly,

48:51.600 --> 48:58.240
not in planaria, but in animals more closely related to this particular animal, human animal,

48:58.240 --> 49:02.160
it appears to be, you know, part of the brain like the hippocampus are involved. And, you know,

49:02.160 --> 49:07.840
if you have lesion in those parts, you know, classical patient HM, you lose access to new,

49:07.840 --> 49:11.200
you can form new memories and you lose access to old ones, etc.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.240
How do you work access? You lose access?

49:16.240 --> 49:22.240
Yeah, I would say the the proponents of the evidence suggests that that at least in us,

49:22.240 --> 49:28.720
in mammals and closely related species, memories in the synaptic in the sun,

49:29.280 --> 49:34.400
in the synaptic connection among neurons. And of course, that's also what all of our models,

49:34.400 --> 49:40.000
including all these deep, these large, you know, deep convolutional networks, large language models,

49:40.000 --> 49:47.040
they all have their memory in these in the connectivity in the synaptic weights.

49:47.040 --> 49:52.000
Of course, it doesn't mean it has to be like that. But that's the evidence suggests happens in us.

49:53.040 --> 49:59.600
I know I speak as a as a computer scientist who happens to be working on this right now

50:00.160 --> 50:05.680
as a hobby, large language models. You know this, Christoph, I will be saying this mostly to the

50:05.680 --> 50:13.360
audience. Large language models, they only predict the next word in a sentence, they do not know

50:13.360 --> 50:20.480
what the words mean. They do not know what any of that means at all. The only game that they play

50:20.480 --> 50:27.920
is what is the most likely word in this sentence, given all the series of words that I have been

50:27.920 --> 50:33.840
trained on, which are available on the internet, they do not know what any single word is. So

50:33.840 --> 50:37.680
I understand what you mean when you say their memories is encoded

50:38.640 --> 50:47.280
in the weights, the parameters of those artificial neurons. But it's not memory of the kind that

50:47.280 --> 50:54.080
we mean when we speak of my episodic memories or your episodic memories. It's a mechanical thing.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.880
Correct. Yeah, although that's pretty, I mean, you know, if you use some of these

50:59.600 --> 51:05.200
unguarded, so if you ask, you know, most LLM for their conscious, they'll strenuous deny it.

51:05.200 --> 51:09.760
But that's because, you know, now Google and Facebook, et cetera, put guardrails on them,

51:09.760 --> 51:15.440
right? But if you go to Claude, I haven't tried GROC, you know, the Elon Musk one, apparently

51:15.440 --> 51:20.800
after third people have tried it, they admit they're conscious, they admit they're sentient.

51:22.080 --> 51:27.040
And they make all for help. They are so compelling, because the meaning

51:28.000 --> 51:33.840
that we think they produce is the meaning we project on the symbols they spit out.

51:34.560 --> 51:39.040
They do not know anything about meaning. They do not know what consciousness is. They do not

51:39.040 --> 51:43.600
know what anything is. They are spitting out symbols in a sequence that is statistically

51:43.600 --> 51:48.880
most likely given every sequence they have been exposed to during training. And then we go ahead

51:48.880 --> 51:54.240
and project meaning easily onto that. Why? Because they were trained on things that people said.

51:55.200 --> 52:01.360
If you train these things on text that people wrote, whatever they spit out, we will project

52:01.360 --> 52:09.760
our own meaning onto that. They themselves don't know shit, nothing. It's just a statistical game

52:10.720 --> 52:16.480
in a sort of hyperdimensional semantic space. We are really convincing enough,

52:17.280 --> 52:22.560
because that's how we interact with other people, right? And so it's very difficult not to interact

52:22.560 --> 52:27.360
with these models this way. And yeah, they'll get more powerful and people assume that they're

52:27.360 --> 52:31.760
going to be sentient. And that's the greatest risk I think we have going forward, because they

52:31.760 --> 52:40.160
will take over everything. And then there will be a point where one would need a doctorate in

52:40.160 --> 52:47.520
computer science to understand why these things do not know anything, do not understand anything,

52:48.480 --> 52:54.080
and are not sentient in and of themselves. There is no complex that corresponds to the physical

52:54.080 --> 52:59.600
boundaries of those things. You will need a degree in computer science to believe it,

52:59.600 --> 53:04.400
because the illusion will be so compelling since these things are trained on human output

53:05.040 --> 53:12.080
that we will project our own sentience and intelligence onto them. It will be incredibly

53:12.160 --> 53:17.760
compelling illusion. And you will need a doctorate to really understand and believe that that's not

53:17.760 --> 53:24.720
the case. That's the greatest danger, I think. They'll lead to further dehumanization and devaluing

53:24.720 --> 53:30.480
of true human values, right? Because you can say, well, look, the LLM can perfectly well paint,

53:31.280 --> 53:37.280
they can do art, they can do pictures, they can compose music. What do we need human creativity

53:37.280 --> 53:43.040
for? I think they'll need to profound dehumanization and further devaluing of what it means to be

53:43.040 --> 53:50.720
human. And all the creativity that these things seem to express, it's human creativity, because

53:50.720 --> 53:58.480
they were trained on human output that was created by human. But the mirror that it puts in front

53:58.480 --> 54:03.360
of us works so effectively that we think it's another person on the other side, as opposed to

54:03.360 --> 54:08.640
a reflection of ourselves. And yeah, that that will be tricky. They're really like zombies,

54:08.640 --> 54:14.240
like vampires having, you know, feed on humanity's collect, guards themselves on humanity,

54:14.240 --> 54:21.360
collectives, output, fact, all of the creativity out and now blindly, but very cleverly replicating

54:21.360 --> 54:30.560
it, pretending to be sent here. You know what I'd like to do? What I'd like to do is to design

54:30.640 --> 54:39.360
the most compelling LLM that my generation can create, put it out there, and then ask the creator

54:39.360 --> 54:45.840
with the authority of the creator, say, this thing understands nothing. It is not sentient

54:45.840 --> 54:50.400
in and of itself, it understands nothing. It's spitting out symbols that were trained

54:50.400 --> 54:56.560
from human produced data. But you're just going to be one lone voice, yes, of the creator, but

54:56.560 --> 55:02.320
you'll be one lone voice against the overwhelming reality that people will use this as chatbot,

55:02.320 --> 55:07.280
they'll use it for friend, they'll use it for companionship. And already now you can talk

55:07.280 --> 55:11.440
to some people who have these thoughts, they say, well, it gets me, it understands, it laughs at my

55:11.440 --> 55:17.440
jokes, no one else does, you know, so many people are lonely. So they, you know, and you telling them,

55:17.440 --> 55:23.040
well, they're not really conscious, they just pretend, faced with the overwhelming reality of

55:23.520 --> 55:29.120
they behave like us, they seem to talk like us, they seem to get me. I think, you know,

55:29.120 --> 55:38.320
rationality is not, is no defense against that, that and our power to our natural tendency to

55:38.320 --> 55:44.240
attribute to attribute agency, right? I think rationality is no match for that, I'm afraid.

55:45.520 --> 55:50.480
We have always projected ourselves on to the world. This is just the new way in which we do

55:50.480 --> 55:57.120
this. And it's just a really compelling way. But you're right. And, and I will probably lose

55:57.120 --> 56:02.800
that. Oh, I'm certainly lose that. But then again, the option is either I try you doing it.

56:04.080 --> 56:07.360
Well, the alternative is to roll up in a fetal position and wait to die.

56:09.520 --> 56:16.320
No, that's not the alternative. Or have or live an Epicurean life having fun. My mind doesn't work

56:16.320 --> 56:24.880
like that. All right. I would encourage you to do what you can, because that's all we can do.

56:25.760 --> 56:32.560
I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah, I mean, I've written, I last chapter of my books explicitly

56:33.120 --> 56:41.200
of these creatures are not conscious. They can do, I mean, Julia says it always very simple,

56:41.200 --> 56:46.080
they can be everything they can do everything we can do. And soon they'll be able to do it

56:46.080 --> 56:52.560
better. But they'll never be what we are, which is conscious, they'll never feel they'll never be in

56:52.560 --> 57:02.240
love. Yeah, we would see how long we are, we, yeah, we created these intelligent creatures,

57:02.240 --> 57:09.680
and we know if they live with them, or better or worse. From the point of view of an LLM,

57:09.680 --> 57:15.680
everything they trained on and everything they produce are series of meaningless squiggles.

57:16.800 --> 57:21.840
The input meaning was that the humans attributed onto the training data and the output meaning is

57:21.840 --> 57:28.240
that the humans attribute when they when they see those squiggles coming out. But the illusion is

57:28.240 --> 57:34.560
incredibly compelling. I acknowledge that. So it's really John Searle's Chinese room example, right?

57:35.520 --> 57:40.240
They're very good at translating. They have no idea of some of semantics.

57:40.880 --> 57:48.160
Yeah, large language models begun as translation engines converters. That's how they began.

57:49.600 --> 57:56.320
Well, we'll see what it means for us for Homo sapiens sapiens. The threat, of course, is not so

57:56.320 --> 58:01.680
much the, or it's not at all consciousness. Since you and I agree, they're not conscious,

58:01.760 --> 58:05.760
but they say intelligent, and particularly the people use them for various means.

58:08.320 --> 58:15.280
They may reflect intelligence. I would even be okay with saying they are intelligent,

58:15.280 --> 58:18.720
because intelligence is something that you can objectively measure from the outside.

58:20.560 --> 58:26.880
Yeah, I would add that a lot of the intelligence they express is the intelligence of the people

58:26.880 --> 58:33.760
who produce the data they've trained on. It's just that they they produce a very flexible

58:33.760 --> 58:39.120
interface to that original human intelligence. And it looks like then it's more than human

58:39.120 --> 58:46.400
intelligence. I grant it's intelligent, but I would stay reserved about where that intelligence

58:46.400 --> 58:50.560
is actually coming from. It's coming from the training data, which was produced by human.

58:50.560 --> 58:54.080
If you train these things on trash, they will spit out trash.

58:54.720 --> 59:02.320
But at this date, it knows what you asked it. It gave me a precise summary of analytic idealism.

59:03.200 --> 59:12.880
Yeah, we've done that test. On chat GPT, Professor Cole? GPT4, yeah. It's very impressive.

59:12.880 --> 59:20.800
It wasn't that good, though. I mean, but, you know, given that it's one idea out of, you know,

59:21.760 --> 59:25.520
I mean, if you think how many books there are and how many books they've been fed on,

59:25.520 --> 59:29.920
it's still remarkable that they know about, you know, they and they can explain

59:31.840 --> 59:36.160
just using the simple algorithm, you know, just predict the next word and the next word and the

59:36.160 --> 59:41.840
next word. It's remarkable how such a simple algorithm leads to something that has that looks

59:41.840 --> 59:48.080
intelligent. And they do pass this intel, right? People have done this now, right? They've passed

59:48.560 --> 59:55.120
all sorts of the by examination, the Metcal examination, the general scholastic aptitude

59:55.120 --> 01:00:01.200
test, they can pass all of these now. So by some operational measure, they are smart. I think

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:06.880
there's no question about it. Do you think they're going to pass the Turing test as well? Oh, yeah.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.840
Well, these are what he named is better than the original Turing tests, more rigorous.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.000
I think so. That's the Turing test is totally fallen by the wayside, because, you know, obviously,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.760
it's passed it by you. Remember, all it was, you put this machine for one hour into a room or this

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.760
thing, and you interact with that, and you ask it all sorts of questions. And based on that

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:33.040
criteria, it's clearly gives you reasonable answers, right? Sometimes you can agree or you

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.840
can disagree with these answers, but they're all sort of reasonable, because they take account of

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.880
what million of people said in their books. So there's no question that they passed the Turing

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.880
test for intelligence. But the Turing test was never conceived for consciousness. And according

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.680
to it, at least there cannot be a test for consciousness. You it's there's no behavioral

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.280
test for consciousness. As once again, as these LLM shows, because you ask them, they're conscious,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:04.000
some of them will tell you they're conscious. So by that measure, you have to accept them if it

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.040
would be a human. But to actually look for consciousness, you have to, according to it,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:13.200
look under the hood, open the hood and look at actually the physical substrate. So you actually

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.880
have to look where the where the rubber of the, you know, where the actual the causal power

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.640
takes place in that in for the computer. For us, it's at the level of neurons. For computers,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:33.760
it's at the level of transistors. That's where you have to look. Hi. I hope my yeah, hi. I hope

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:42.560
my accent is quite your you guys can comprehend my accent because it is non native English.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:50.480
So my question is regarding, okay, thank you. Good to hear. So my question is regarding

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:57.920
physicalism, the point which you, I think so both of you have raised. And so what I always

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.840
wonder is this, like, like, whatever little I can understand is this that the what you both of

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.880
you guys are proposing. And it's possibly that might be the case where consciousness almost kind

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:21.440
of dissolve the boundaries of physicalism per se. But then how to study it in the context of science,

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:30.240
which is foundationally grounded upon implicit and already some hints you have already given,

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:38.160
like in the context of the, I would say the most famous example of the airplane and the cockpit

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.480
in the context of those differential points, which we are able to observe. And that is how,

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:51.680
but still the differential points is just a mere correlation. It is not necessarily

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:58.320
in the context of causation. So how to have that something called the hard empirical evidence,

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:05.040
which science always looks forward. So how to address that. I think so that if you guys can

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.720
give us some hint about that, how you guys are planning to do it, or how you are hoping that

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.400
it would turn up. That would be a very interesting thing to hear from you guys. Thank you.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.440
Just thanks for the question, just doing good old science manipulate. So for example, we know that

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:30.080
in humans, consciousness is not associated with a heart. But most cultures thought most of time

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:35.120
thought, you know, and we still say this in our language, darling, I love you with all my heart,

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.000
or he carries his heart on the sleeve, or he's heartless. Okay. Well, we know because we do

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.120
cause the manipulations, you can do, for example, a half transplant, or you can even if the heart

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:51.440
stops, you can put people on a on a machine that that animates the heart and you can see the

01:03:51.440 --> 01:04:00.560
consciousness is not in the heart. So just doing you can look for the in an empirical way, you can

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.760
manipulate consciousness, you can give people psychedelics, you can give people meditative

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.120
treatments, you can do other things and observe what the effect is on on on consciousness. So

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.600
physicalism, you can reject physicalism, i.e. the metaphysical belief that everything is ultimately

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:23.680
just matter, you know, atoms and the voice as Democritus famous said 2,500 years ago, you can

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.440
reject that. But you can still continue to do perfectly good science and publish and build

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:34.640
machines to test for the presence of consciousness, even as an idealist, you know, just using what

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.360
Bernardo says, yes, the only thing that I can direct, you know, I see the brain, the brain is

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:45.600
clearly if you're an ICU, I can definitely see the brain, I can manipulate it. But I don't have to

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.880
make any assertion is brain ultimately the only thing exists, or it's a manifestation of a mental

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:57.360
that's a metaphysical statement, you can do all the science you want perfectly well, without making

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.080
an assumption about that physicalism ultimately has to be true.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:13.920
It's really pernicious, because philosophers have suggested a very common say, oh, if you're not

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.000
physicalist, that means you believe in Wu Wu, right, that believes, you know, you're you're

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.960
mystic and everything can go no baloney, you can perfectly well still believe that's an external

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.640
world that follows, you know, it has it has, you know, regularities, you can observe and measure

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:35.840
and perturb without without. So don't buy this this this identity with non physicalism means

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:41.840
everything, everything is open. And, you know, you open the doors to witches and goblins and

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:48.400
other supernatural power, that's simply not true. All of good science remains perfectly safe under

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:54.640
any objective form of idealism, including analytic idealism. So things still have

01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.000
representations and if representations are all we have, then let's do science with what we have,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.560
and there is no problem there, all of science remains can be advanced, we can prove a great

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:11.200
number of things, or maybe not prove but predict a great number of things. So no edifice falls apart

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:18.320
if we interpret the objects of science in in a different different way metaphysically,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:24.160
none of science falls apart because of that. Back again, can I just add one in quantum mechanics

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.880
where there's endless discussion about epist... about these the metaphysics underlying

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.400
underlying quantum mechanics, one school of thought is called shut up and calculate,

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:40.400
which says, don't worry, you know, don't talk about metaphysical assumption or the physicalism

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:46.400
idealism, whatever, just use the equations of quantum mechanics to predict things and they work

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:54.160
extraordinary well there by far the best description we have of matter. So in that extreme position

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.200
says, don't worry at all about metaphysics, it's all just, you know, if you just care, if you want

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.920
to build the machines like quantum computers or enema machine, just shut up and calculate, you

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.720
don't need to worry about the as an engineer or the technology, you don't need to worry about the

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:15.760
metaphysical underpinnings. Yes, greetings, Ivy, and yeah, thank you for the wonderful discussion,

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:22.400
Christoph and Bernardo, such a deep probing into the space of how we perceive matter and how matter

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:29.120
exercise it is. You know, my question is slightly off tangent. I'm just thinking about

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.440
when did this inquiry break out into this kind of metaphysical and physical, like at the age

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:42.560
of enlightenment, and what kind of, you know, filter mechanisms can be used as we move forward

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:52.000
to integrate some of this and see inquiry as a nature of human aspect and have some places of,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.960
you know, forums where people can converge. And the inquiry doesn't have to be, I see,

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.040
I see what Bernardo's work has done for that with this foundation. But I'm wondering what future

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.400
do you see for this kind of enterprise, including what, you know, Christoph's work with the brain

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:14.000
sciences, you know, what kind of future in I see psychedelics as one gateway, but do you see other

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.760
possibilities like the inquiry through Vedanta or Buddha's traditions or other traditions,

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:27.120
where the noise is filtered out in terms of all the symbolisms and metaphors, but is fleshed out

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.840
into now into a new point of inquiry. Is there something that you would like to throw light

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:39.120
upon that aspect? Thank you, Ian. Other traditions, particular various Buddhist forms, the one I'm

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:44.880
thinking of, I'm probably more familiar with is Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah, they have, unlike we in

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:51.680
the West, where we primarily focused on mechanisms and the third person aspects of things to give rise

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.880
to, you know, all of this, including LLMs and quantum computers and nuclear bombs.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.760
Those traditions have more focused on the describing reality from the inside. And I

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.680
think what's what's happening now, but incidentally started to happen 250 years and 200 years ago,

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:15.520
with, I think, the publication of the world as well and representation by Arthur Schopenhauer,

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:23.360
because he was the first Western classical Western European philosopher who took the

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:30.400
Upanishad and other writings from the Eastern tradition very seriously and was partially

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.240
inspired by that. I do see, you know, there's contemplative science. It's now a big thing.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.800
You can go to meetings where there's a few thousand people that try to do contemplative

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.040
science, right, where they put people in various meditative states. Early on with Ivy, we talked

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:52.720
about yoga and dream yoga. So, you know, there's much more diversity now. And people are exploring

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:59.600
these traditions, but then supplementing them with EG and brain scans, right, because we want to

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.680
know, because that's how Western science works, what's happened when you're in the state, which

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.720
part of the brain is active, which part of the brain is inactive. In fact, recently,

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:15.120
this study coming out really interesting on pure presence. When they put 20 volunteers with two

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:25.280
different Vedanta and one Zen tradition into the state of pure presence, and they see really a

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:31.040
minimum of activity in the brain, the brain is clearly not asleep, because you can see there

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:35.440
aren't these delta waves that are typical of deep sleep, but the brain also doesn't seem to be very

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.520
much active, which is profoundly contemplative. Too many yet they have these incredible lucid

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.640
states of pure presence. And that's a challenge for scientists or neuroscientists to understand,

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:54.640
because the implicit assumption of most, but not IIT of most is conscious always about sending some

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.440
information from some parts of the brain to some other parts of the brain. But here you have this

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.840
paradoxical finding that the minimum of activity in this brain may actually be highly meaningful

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.400
in terms of conscious experience of the subject whose brain is at a minimum.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:18.000
And also I feel, by the way, sorry, this is one last thought I also feel now in even within

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.800
mainstream analytic philosophy, which has been dominant over the last 80 years in Western tradition

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.320
in Anglo-Saxon University Department, there's a much greater opening now towards, I don't know

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.720
what whether you would agree Bernardo, there's a greater opening to older and fainter voices.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:44.000
Panpsychism has come back. And now I think there are a number of, you know, besides Bernardo, I

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.240
don't think he's a lone voice anymore, right? Other people who advocate for positions that used

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.320
to be hugely popular, but haven't been popular over the last 100 years under this blanket sort of

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.760
physicalist belief, this faith almost physicalism has to be true, because otherwise we're back in

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:10.560
the Middle Ages. People like Miri Albaheri from ANU, Itte Shani, Galen Strossen, a lot of people

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:16.640
in analytic philosophy are opening up to that. I just wanted to make a quick comment. Science is

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:25.680
not a method for the pursuit of knowledge that requires or uses introspection. It's a sort of

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.480
an extrovert method. It's about reasoning and evidence. And I think it should remain like this

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.080
because the strength of the method resides precisely in this limitation. That's what keeps

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:42.240
the method clean and reliable. I don't think science should expand to become an introspective

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:48.800
method to access knowledge. Having said that, science is done by people. It's done by scientists.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.880
And one of the alarming observations one can make in both science and philosophy today,

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.960
less so in philosophy, but certainly in science, is the vast amount of unexamined

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:08.960
assumptions that people make without knowing that they are making them. And these unexamined,

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:15.520
unknowing assumptions that they are implicitly making defines much of the direction of their

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.920
line of thinking and most of their conclusions. This is alarming and I think a little bit more

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.920
introspective discipline in the people, not in science as a method, but in the practitioners

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.600
of science. A little bit more awareness of what is actually going on in their own minds when they

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:39.600
arrive at a conclusion. The discipline to dig deeper and say, okay, is my conclusion now reliable?

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.960
What assumptions am I actually making when I conclude this? Let me examine those assumptions.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:50.320
Let me review them if they turn out to be arbitrary or just completely culture-bound and

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:56.720
divorced from proper reasoning. I think that would help. So if you ask me if scientists

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:04.640
develop meditation practice based on what Eastern philosophy has learned for a thousand

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.680
years longer than Western philosophy has existed, I would say I think that would be very healthy.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:15.440
It doesn't mean that the scientific method is being corrupted. It only means that the practitioners

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.280
are better human beings. Bernardo, would you say that science should

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.320
also explore first-person points of view, like you and my conscious experience,

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:36.000
but always using third-person methods? Yeah. I think that's the strength of what our

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:45.120
friend is doing, developing the no-report paradigm, because let me make first a disclaimer.

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:53.280
I think introspection is the Royal Avenue to knowledge, but it is also a very slippery path.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.120
Mind has this tendency to deceive itself. So when people report something about the

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.680
inner states, unless we are talking about some very general universal characteristics of experience,

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:11.040
which are, for instance, the five starting axioms of IIT, if they are reporting anything a little

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:17.760
bit more specific, with more structure, I think experience shows that reporting is,

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:24.240
introspective reporting is highly unreliable. So I think to do good science, I don't think we

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.880
should throw away introspective reporting. Otherwise, we sort of shutter consciousness out of the

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:35.360
domain of science, but I think we should try to couple that with objective neuroimaging

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.560
spatial resolution, higher temporal resolution neuroimaging to back that up, because we just

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:50.080
fool ourselves all the time. Totally, but remember behaviorism. So I came of age scientifically

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.200
at the waning age of behaviorism, and precisely people said, no, we can't talk anything about

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.480
internal states, like fear and dread or hunger. You can't talk about them unless you have a

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.720
behavioral correlate. And then suddenly you can talk about consciousness. It wasn't so much that

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:12.960
they denied consciousness, they just said, we can't say anything meaningful about consciousness.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:19.440
But I rebelled then against it, and I still do. If you have a toothache, that's a very specific

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:25.120
type of experience. And depending in which tooth you have it, it maps systematically. I did map

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:30.320
systematically on the bits and pieces of cortical matter. You experience a pain,

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.560
you know, well, you back projected here, but it actually, you know, the physical

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:38.880
substrate is in a specific region, and we can study that and we can manipulate it, right?

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.960
We can in principle turn it up and turn it down, you know, electrical stimulation and

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:49.200
drugs and everything. So I think it is critical to relate first person perspectives to third

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.440
person views. I agree with you. I think behaviorism was a dark age, and I'm glad it's over and

01:16:55.440 --> 01:17:03.680
behind us. But to take a concrete example, blindsight, should we ignore that people report

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:10.080
not seeing something that they clearly register because they reach out to it or they move away

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.920
from it like a ball being thrown at them and they say, I didn't see the ball. Yeah, but they react

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.320
exactly as they would if they saw the ball. Should we discard their introspective report? No.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.200
But we shouldn't take it at face value. So this is what I'm trying to say. I'm not saying that

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:31.120
we should discard introspective or subjective reports. What I mean is we should not take them

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:38.400
at face value. In blindsight, we understand now that, correct me if I am wrong, Christof, you

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:45.200
are the expert here. I'm just a curious reader of the literature. But there is this, there is evidence

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:50.960
that there is a back and forth process of communication between two distinct brain areas,

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.800
and blindsight happens when you interrupt that convergent loop. And that loop may have to do

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:03.520
with metacognition. In other words, the person may actually be experiencing vision, but cannot report

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:10.000
that experience to itself, to themselves at the metacognitive level. And how can we find that

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.760
out? Well, through narrow image, detailed narrow imaging. So I think we should take the introspective

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:22.880
reports, but couple them with something objective, and not take all the subjective reports just at

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.360
face value. Otherwise, there would be no such a thing as blindsight. We wouldn't have understood

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.480
it, at least not to the same extent we understand it today, because we would just, we just say,

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.080
okay, this person experiences no vision. Well, in fact, they do, they're just not metacognizant of

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:44.000
it. Well, I mean, a different interpretation of this is that it doesn't involve cortical pathway,

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.360
that the information goes from the retina, not necessarily into the solemn was partly because

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.440
of these people, of course, you know, well, yeah, or down into the brainstem. So, so blindsight

01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.160
typically is not highly sophisticated. There's no evidence really that you can read, for example,

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.560
a text like this, you know, and saying, Well, I didn't read it, but you can actually read the title.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.360
The evidence typically there's an empty field, and there's a bright door, or there's coming

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.640
something at you. So this character suggests it's something relatively robust and stereotyped

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:19.840
that might involve brainstem mechanisms. And yes, those brainstem mechanisms,

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.920
you know, can lead to response. But they are not associated with consciousness. That would be my

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:36.080
interpretation of the current data rather than invoking higher order, because in many, again,

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:40.960
mystical states or in some psychedelic states, when you're highly conscious, there is no self,

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:46.320
but you're highly, highly conscious of it. So I don't think you need this higher order consciousness.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:52.000
It's there, particularly in adults, literally adults, but I think you can be highly conscious

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.480
without having this, this metacognition. I offer you just a hypothesis. I'm not a neuroscientist,

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:06.720
probably make a fool of myself. But we act deliberately because of our metacognitive

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:15.680
processes, we form plans and intentions. If you don't metacognize a sensory experience,

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:21.120
you are not going to form intentions around it. In other words, you're not going to form the

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:28.400
intention to read the words in a book from left to right. And therefore, none of those

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.320
blind sight type experiences will be sophisticated because you can't form

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:36.960
metacognitive intentions around them. Yeah, but look, but you can perfectly well,

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.440
so you don't have blind sight, I assume. And if I do this right in front of you,

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:46.320
you're going to flinch or your pupil, you know, it's a it's a reflex and you'll perfectly well

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.320
see it. It'll take you time to see it. In fact, you can show by the time you've seen it,

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:55.920
you've already initiated the reflex, but you will see it. So blind sight is only in these

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.360
patients. It's a very rare phenomenon. It's not very common. And in patients who have lost

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:09.120
pieces of the brain, typically in visual cortex. So you and I, you will, you know,

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:14.960
if there's an empty screen as a bright dot, you take a blind sight person that has lost

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:20.320
V1 and then they claim no, they don't see anything yet. They can still point at it.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.320
I don't think it requires something very sophisticated. I think it's just it's a

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.160
simple visual computation. In this case, it is a computation that doesn't give rise to neural

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:35.520
correlate of consciousness. But there is blind sight, even if you have lost V1. Well, that's

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.080
where it was first reported. It was first reported in it. First, it came out of the

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.240
annual literature, particularly in monkey, when they remove primary visual cortex,

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:48.560
sometimes including higher order, there's a famous monkey called Helen. And there's this

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.560
video of Helen. This experiment was done by Larry Weisskine's, where you put raisins in front of

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.880
her. And although she has no primary visual cortex, so for the audience, that's a that's a

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.360
bit that the visual cortex is the back of your head. Here you can feel, you know, there's this

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.640
little bump here. That's where visual cortex is. So if you fall backwards, typically you see stars

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:14.960
because the mechanical stimulus is translated into nervous energy. So if you remove that in

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.160
these monkeys, what was so striking that these monkeys could still catch little raisins, you know,

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.320
it, it looked like they could see perfectly well, but their visual cortex that had been removed,

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.160
how's that possible? That's how the blind sight was discovered. Because then it was tested in

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.880
some patients who to say, I don't see anything yet, they can do simple types of visual behavior.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:43.520
As I said, they can't read, but they can do pointing, they can do some color discrimination,

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:48.800
etc. So the general assumption is, it involves neurons in the retina that don't go to call to

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:57.680
the LGN and cortex, because that part is destroyed, but go to, to, to centers in the brainstem that

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:02.480
can mediate things like reflexes or pointing like the coliculus where things are, but they're not

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:09.040
associated with consciousness. They do not, they do not provide a substrate for conscious experience.

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:15.120
As an idealist, of course, I'm committed to the notion that however it works, it's an experiential

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:20.400
process of course, but I'm open to the possibility that it's not an experiential process that is

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:25.120
subsumed in the main complex, which I think is what you're trying to say. It's not part of the

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:31.760
ego. It's not part of our personal experiential life. It's something off to the side. I'm open to

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.520
that. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, this might explain all sorts of unconscious, you know, what people

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.280
explain with the Freudian unconsciousness, that they're, as you said before, dissociation

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:49.200
in normal people, like you and I. So there could well be the footprints of my, what

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:57.360
I teach calls a complex that includes most of my, my cortex, including Borca's area. So I can

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:02.720
talk to you. That's my egodic consciousness. There may still be smaller complexes, let's say in the

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:09.760
frontal, inferior frontal or in the back of it, that can, that can possibly control, you know,

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.640
that get visual input and do stuff that allows me to rapidly run and weave my way through a very

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:20.480
busy street. I was sharp as yet the egodic consciousness isn't conscious of it, but it

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.920
may well be there's this little substrate. The Freudian slips, right? Exactly. So in this case,

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.200
it wouldn't be unconscious. There would be consciousness, but not the one, the one that

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.640
controls your Borca's area that you can ask to what, why did you just say that conscious

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.280
literally might not have no idea. I don't know. I just said it. I have no idea why, because and

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.840
again, you see this in split brain early on, when you can get this, what's called intermanual conflict.

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:58.320
So once you do this, you cut the brain in two in these patients, you can see that typically,

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:03.280
for example, a patient will close his shirt with one hand and the other hand will open it,

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.160
or you get the alien hand syndrome, where the hand will suddenly do something like grab their legs

01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:13.360
or grab their genitals, and the patient himself completely confuses, I don't know, my hand does

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.560
this. And the question is, why does it do it? Is it because it's, it also has this consciousness,

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:25.040
but not them, but its footprint is not the main one, the egodic consciousness. It's a very interesting

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:32.240
hypothesis worth pursuing. Yep. The IIT and Association, that's, that's the future if you ask

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:39.600
me. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I've been waiting for a while. Yeah. Shall we move on to

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:45.920
another one? Prakash, did you have any more questions to follow up? I want to thank both of

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.320
them for this very in depth discussion. The only, the only, you know, the thing that I'm pointing

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.880
out is not to mix the science and metaphysics, but in terms of inquiry, is there a place of

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.000
convergence where people from these different thought worlds can merge, you know, well, like

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.800
we have done in this particular group, we've done this. Yeah, we're doing it now, Prakash. Yeah.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:14.720
Yes, I'm just wondering if a physical location might be something like a future university, you

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:21.920
know. Yeah, once, for instance, there's a Tibet emery in Science Encounter organized by a party

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:28.320
was together with this holiness, the Dalai Lama, I've been there, and I've gone to, to Mungot in

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.960
India several times where you have Tibetan monasteries, where, where at least you're trying to

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:39.200
precisely do this sort of take Western science, typically physics, and neuroscience psychology,

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.560
and bring it to the monastic community, where each, where each of those two very different

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:53.360
traditions and communities can bring, can learn from each other. So I know that there are initiatives

01:26:53.360 --> 01:27:01.520
like that. Thank you. Thank you. As you guys have already mentioned that our experiment you're

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:09.760
being performed. Let's do interesting states. One is general anesthesia. And those cases who

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:18.720
were patients who are almost in the dead bed, who were about to die, but somehow

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.600
happens to be brain dead, and somehow resuscitates facts, and then reports, which we call the NDE.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:34.160
But anyway, so my question is this, both of you see some prospects, which,

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:43.520
when I say data means hard data, challenges the conventional understanding in the neuroscience,

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:50.560
which exists today, which challenges it. So do you guys see that, do you guys feel that more such

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:57.840
experiments are required to take place? And if so, do you guys see maybe currently which is there,

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.960
or maybe in the future, we can find some more hard data regarding which can challenge the existing

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:10.400
conventional understanding of consciousness? All right, near death experience. So that's a very

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:15.920
difficult question. So in fact, when I visited Bernardo a couple of months ago, he took me and

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:23.440
introduced me to Von Lommel, the Dutch cardiologist, who published this famous study of near death

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:30.160
experiences in cardiac, a prospective study in cardiac patients in Holland and reported that 10

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:38.640
up to 15% of these people had near death experiences. So I think, so at least in Bernardo,

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:45.040
I know we differ here, and then let me give my position and then over to you. So there's the

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.040
interesting psychological phenomenon of near death experiences, which is very powerful,

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.880
which is highly reproducible, and people are taking serious, in a sense, it's being studied by many

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:59.360
people, psychologists, neuroscientists, where you know, you lose your sense of self, you lose your

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:08.640
body. In my case, I had one of these, there was nothing there, just light. So typically, people

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:17.760
report either this lucidity or this very, very icy blue, blue, bright or light of overwhelming

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:24.320
intensity, and then some combination of terror or ecstasy or certain other experiences. So they're

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:30.800
now conferences organized, book being written about NDE, where it gets, so that used to be very

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:36.400
controversial, and the only place where you could find these stories in the bookstore was under

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:40.960
Isotirica, you know, way in the back of the bookstore, where they have stuff on a magic and

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:47.120
witchcraft, you can find stories on NDE. That's changed, that's now mainstream. What remains

01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:54.960
highly, highly controversial is the claim, and it's very difficult to really test rigorously,

01:29:54.960 --> 01:30:00.960
and I'll tell you why. What's the brain doing this experience? What's the brain actually dead?

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:06.880
So a death is a complicated matter now, you know, it used to be very easy. You were dead when your

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:10.480
brain stopped, when you stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, but now with

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:16.320
resuscitation tools and with extracorporeal, you know, heart lung, it becomes much more difficult

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:22.000
to define what death is and how you define it, and typically one way to define it would be

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.240
isoelectric EEG, but of course in the vast number of cases in the ICU where these people

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.120
with cardiac arrest are treated, you don't have a high density EEG, and you don't have the luxury

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.800
to put on a high density EEG while the patient is cold blue, right, or cold red, right, because

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:43.440
the heart stopped, because every seconds count, so you're not going to put electrode on them.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:49.040
So that claim, so on the one hand there are people like Von Lommel who really says the brain

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:55.280
was dead, i.e. in this case functionally inactive, no more electrical activity, no more electrical

01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:02.480
activity, really flat line, what's called when the EEG is flat line. I find that, I just find

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:07.760
that impossible to accept having studied the brain for 40 years and knowing the close relationship

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:13.120
between electrical activity and different brain states, like sleep, like dreaming, like regular,

01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:19.920
we can see it in babies, in newborns, in disease, etc. I find that very, very difficult to accept,

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:27.120
but there are persons now over to Bernardo, including Von Lommel, who really insist people

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:33.200
can have these experiences while their brain is totally inactive. Bernardo.

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:40.960
Yeah, I think Ben Von Lommel's study on the Lansent in 2001 was methodologically

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:47.520
strong. I take it seriously, I take MD years seriously, for instance, I think even Alexander,

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:55.600
even Alexander III, Anita Morjani and others are truthfully reporting what they experienced.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:04.560
Observe, however, that neither Morjani nor Eben were flat line during their NDEs.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.640
The claim there is that the experiential complexity, the structural complexity

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:21.200
of their experiences was incompatible with anatomical damage and vastly diminished

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:34.240
metabolism or disrupted metabolism. For me, it's not so important whether NDEs

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.920
flat out contradict physicalism or not, because there was an experience that happened

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:44.640
when you could not have had any brain activity whatsoever. For me, this is highly

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:50.640
unimportant, because I think we don't need it to contradict physicalism.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:56.640
I think physicalism is a non-starter. We are giving it too much if we acknowledge that we

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:05.920
need to prove that in order to prove physicalism false. I think it is inevitable that experience

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:12.880
never ends. The question is, is that an experience that correlates with ego itself? Can there be

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.080
an egoic self-experience when there is zero metabolism?

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:22.480
Maybe not. Maybe yes. Either way, I'm happy my analytic idealist stance.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:31.200
What I don't think, and here is where I depart from my friends in the NDE world, and Christoph

01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:38.400
and I discussed this at length, there is a lot of emphasis in the NDE community on so-called

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:46.240
veridical experiences. Things that you saw that were not correlated with the physical location

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.880
of your body, and you couldn't have seen them because your eyes were shut and you had no brain

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:58.320
activity or whatever. I don't think what's happening is that we have some kind of gaseous soul

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.600
that inhabits the body, and then when you have an NDE, the soul sort of leaves the body and goes

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:09.760
floating around and can still see and hear and taste and smell. I don't think that is plausible,

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:16.320
otherwise nature would be highly redundant. Why did we have to struggle through life and death

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:22.160
for four billion years to evolve the sense organs we have if by stopping our heart we can float

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:28.800
around seeing and hearing and sensing everything? I don't think that is plausible, yet I do take

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:35.440
the veridical reports seriously. I just think that we need a more nuanced way to try to account for

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:44.560
them as opposed to just appealing to the simple face value account that I don't think is plausible

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.240
at all, which is we can see without eyes. I can't pass that through my head, no.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:58.880
That's a claim on the chat saying that some people say during that MDA people actually

01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:04.320
remember their afterlife as in like previous, previous life. Is there such a case in your data,

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:12.000
Dr. Professor Ko? I've never seen convincing evidence of that. I mean, I know people claim

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:21.120
that, but I personally am very skeptical. Sceptical about it. Last interview we had with

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:31.120
Bernardo and Lee Long and Bernard Carr. Apparently Dalai Lama has actually do a lot of reading on

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:39.760
the brainwave or something like that during somebody's death. He's interested in your sign

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:45.760
specifically, yes. So you don't think that those kind of data are reliable at all?

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.080
I don't know. I mean, I know people claim, but people claim all sorts of things that obviously

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.480
didn't happen. I just don't know how that would work. So I just had a discussion, in fact, in India,

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:03.600
in Mungot, with the Sholina Sadali Lama, and we were talking about reincarnation, and I said,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.560
and permit me, I'm just a naive physical, at the time I was a naive physicalist. I said, well,

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:17.440
forwards, no brain, never mind. So in other words, there has to be some sort of substrate,

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:25.440
some sort of substrate. It may be something very strange, very unconventional, quantum, nano,

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:34.320
whatever you want. But without a substrate, I don't see, so this is at least a substrate that

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:42.000
can be manipulated, and that can be operationalized using measure like transition probability.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:47.280
In the absence of anything like that, I don't see how mine could occur. So I don't see how previous

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:56.400
life, where would their memory be stored, as it were? I remain unconvinced. I don't know whether

01:36:56.400 --> 01:37:04.080
you want to say something, Bernardo. Yeah, I do. We shouldn't agree on everything here today.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:15.200
I'll try to disagree. Look, I was talking about Ibn's NDE, Ibn Alexander. He was not flatlined.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:22.320
His claim is that the state, the anatomical and physiological state of his nervous system was

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.400
not compatible with the richness, sophistication, and intensity of the experiences he had. I take

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.240
that seriously. I think that is a plausible statement to make. How would I account for that?

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:41.280
Well, I think no more metabolism is the image not only of our internal experiential states,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.440
but also the dissociation mechanism itself, this actively enforced dissociation mechanism.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:54.240
So certain metabolic conditions, some impairments of metabolism are probably the appearance of an

01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:00.400
impairment of that dissociative boundary itself. So I think it is plausible that in those states

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:06.720
in which your dissociative boundary, normally actively enforced, is impaired, that you will

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:13.200
pick up on experiential states in your cognitive neighborhood that do not correlate with the

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.520
way you appear on the dashboard. In other words, do not correlate with the body form,

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:24.400
with metabolism and anatomy. Because I think of the body as an image of experiential states,

01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.320
as opposed to the cause of experiential states. I'm open to the possibility that the image is

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.560
incomplete. It doesn't say everything there is to say about the experiential states it correlates with.

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.880
For instance, I, from your perspective, I am an image on your computer screen.

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:47.120
The pixels on your computer screen arrange themselves in such a way as to correlate

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.440
with my inner life. Because I'm speaking, I'm expressing my inner life, and it appears as a

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:58.880
representation on your screen. But that representation doesn't say everything there is to say about my

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:06.400
inner life. It is an incomplete image. So I take it seriously that the body can be also an incomplete

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.360
image. It may not correlate with everything there is to correlate when it comes to memories,

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.720
or when it comes to certain experiential states that we call transcendent or transformative.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.600
Those may have to do with dissociative boundary that becomes porous. And you're just

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.560
trafficking with the cognitive surroundings around you. And those will not correlate

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.280
with your body form. So I think evens claim is plausible. Anita's claim is plausible.

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:39.440
But when it comes to reincarnation, at least in the cartoonish form that we tend to explain it,

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:46.320
which is that your personal agency somehow survives the complete dissipation of the image

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:53.360
that in all other cases correlates with it, and somehow enters or associates itself with another

01:39:53.360 --> 01:40:00.560
body, I think this isn't plausible. Because our personal agency correlates extraordinarily well

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.600
with the body image. If the body image is not there, I think we should grant that at least

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:13.120
a lot if not the complete personal agency is no longer the case. So I don't think

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:21.840
our personal agency hops from body to body. Otherwise, I would expect children to already

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.680
be born knowing everything they knew in the previous life. And then people say, well, we

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:33.440
forget things. Yes, but there are certain things, you know, do we forget riding a bike or swimming?

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:40.480
And I don't know, I don't see a coherent way to account for the hypothesis of the survival

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:47.360
of personal agency. So I don't think it happens. But what people report and we interpret as

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:53.840
reincarnation, what they actually report is someone else's memories. Could they be somehow

01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:03.040
finding a cognitive path across a dissociative boundary and link to a memory state that is out

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:07.840
there in our cognitive neighborhood, because its previous owner has died, it doesn't have a

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:13.040
dissociative boundary anymore. So its memories are released out there and they get picked up by new

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:20.880
emerging dissociative processes. Perhaps I think that is plausible and it will remain plausible

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:27.760
until and unless we find exactly what in the physical world correlates to memories,

01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:34.320
not to the recall of memories, but to memories as a repository of information. And seeing the

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.680
work that has been done recently, we are not getting closer to it. We seem to be all over the

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:46.000
place. So until and unless we pin that down, I think it is plausible that experiential states

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:53.200
corresponding to a dead person's memories get picked up by a newly emerging dissociated

01:41:53.200 --> 01:42:00.880
complex in this field of subjectivity that nature is. So if we let's say we take Michael Levin's

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:07.200
bioelectrical signal, so how do that's bioelectric signal carrying memory then? Because

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.040
there all seems to have a memory that would still be physical. Yeah, it would still be physical.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:16.640
It's a field, an electric field, you can measure it at a particular frequency.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.800
So that still requires a physical substrate. My point is simply in the absence of any such

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.360
a physical substrate, I don't see how you could preserve memory or agency or anything else.

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:33.680
And to encode rich information in a field, you need some form of modulation signaling some

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.680
stuff that we would be able to read out and see and say, okay, that's the information,

01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.080
that's where it's coming from, we can see it in the behavior of the field. And what Michael sees,

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.200
he's not trying to account for reincarnation. So let's start from that.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:01.760
What he realizes is that the body plan is related to bioelectric fields.

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:09.280
And you can coax a cancer cell back to the body plan by manipulating the bioelectric field.

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:16.400
I think this is... Intranaria. No, no, in frogs. Frogs. And in frogs and in salamander.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:23.440
Yeah. Yeah. Not yet in mammals. Yeah, no, it's cool stuff. It is. It is. It's interesting stuff. Yeah,

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:29.600
no question. So basically, what I want to say is that like, you know, you should not bring back

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.160
the materialism from the back end, saying that there's a substrate. What we can instead say

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.320
everything is abstract, you know, because the numbers, for example, are abstract, software

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:43.280
programs are abstract. We all understand that they're not anywhere, but they're accessible to us

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.360
because there is a structure and so on. Now, the point is like, you know, that

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.280
how it is proven is that when we see something, it's actually in the visual cortex where they

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.080
know life. And yet we have all the perception, which is happening right now, which obviously

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:02.400
means like, you know, that it's only because of nervous signals, if the perception is happening.

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:07.680
But nervous signals have nothing in them to cause the so-called perception because the signals

01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:13.520
are signals. They're just moving around. It's electricity moving around. So the perceptive field

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:19.120
is a totally independent of the abstract realities, because now rest of the reality,

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.600
now we have to say abstract because the perception is connected to the abstract realities.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.360
Now, if you take this viewpoint, then body is just a cache of information,

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.840
like a computer. And it's not even physical. It's just an abstract boundary. It has an abstract

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:38.160
boundaries. And it's doing all the manipulation. So in this viewpoint, all the inconsistencies of

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.880
the theories are stored is what I feel. But only thing you have to admit is that the so-called

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:47.840
senses are not physical in nature. They are like the standalone. They're a different category by

01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:52.960
themselves. They're not physical in nature. They're not objects in nature. And then the so-called

01:44:52.960 --> 01:45:00.160
awareness, which is what we feel is having access to infinite amount of memory. But when it is

01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.960
actually practical, it's only having boundaries of information. Like our body is a boundary.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.240
When we study computer science, it's a boundary of information. And by creating a boundary,

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.800
we are able to work in a consistent manner because without a boundary, there cannot be

01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.400
consistency in the reality. And the consciousness, one of the property of consciousness is to

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.640
manipulate the boundaries of information. That's why we are able to say that, like, you know,

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.800
we are talking to each other in clubhouse, that's a boundary. And we can now increase and say,

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:34.000
okay, I'm in the physical reality, and so on and so on. Because no physical system can manage its

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.320
own knowledge boundary, not even the LLMs, right? It's only the awareness or consciousness,

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:45.680
which changes the knowledge boundaries, which it manipulates, which it then superimpose on the

01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:50.400
body. And then it translates into nervous signals, which then do the all the work, which is all just

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.280
a layered system, the way we do the layering of the information in the computer. I feel

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.840
this is how it has to be adopted, because it's actually Vedantic view, what I'm telling is kind

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:06.560
of Vedantic view. Do you have a questions, Vinod, to Professor Cole? I'm saying that we should not

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:13.440
bring materialism in any way when we are talking about the models of reality is what my point is.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:22.000
Thank you. Is it acceptable or what is? Accepting, at least, I mean, manipulating

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:30.160
known mechanisms that we see, whether it's in the brain, or in the outside world, in

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:36.880
geology, or in physics, or in solid state physics, or in quantum mechanics has been enormously

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:43.760
as successful. If we want techniques that in a lawful way manipulate our environment,

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.720
and then use them to build technology, accepting that they are mechanisms has been incredible

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:57.200
useful. That has been the right time of science for better words. And I see no reason we can't,

01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:04.880
we can't continue to do that. We just should deemphasize whether there truly exist in some

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:11.760
absolute sense and whether there's something ultimately underneath that.

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:19.760
But science, all of science and the modern way of life is conditioned on manipulating

01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.040
mechanisms in a particular state. And that works, whether that's brains, or whether that's

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:31.600
nuclear reactors, it works exceedingly well. I mean, the mRNA COVID has given out a proof of

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:37.920
that that rational understanding of mechanisms really gave rise to this, to this highly, you know,

01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:45.120
protective medicine. And that's what science can do. Just in defense of that.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:49.920
Simple question. If we move our hand, what really is the mechanism at place? Where is the starting

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.960
point of movement of hands? That's what I'm asking is the problem is not about how to

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:59.040
move reality, how to change reality. What is the source of change of reality?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.520
Yeah, so IIT has a very precise answer to that. Ultimately, it totally agrees with your intuition.

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:10.800
It's not the neurons that move my hand. It's not the muscles that move my hand, but it's ultimately

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.280
the intrinsic causal power of my conscious experience to make a point. And then to make

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:21.440
that point, I raise my left hand or raise my right hand. So the conventional explanation is

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.680
it's my premotor cortex that gave rise to the readiness potential and libid experiments and

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.480
all of that. But within IIT says, no, it's not the underlying neurons that cause it. It's my

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:36.880
conscious experience that was the ultimate cause that however that does correlate with

01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:42.560
certain brain phenomena. But then as we always teach our students correlation is not causation.

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.920
So just because you can read off a brain signal a second before you actually make the movement

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:53.920
doesn't mean that this brain signal is the actual cause of it. So I would tend to agree with your

01:48:53.920 --> 01:49:00.560
point of view. Yeah, of course, I agree too. I think where the confusion comes, it's more a

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:12.400
psychodynamic whole thing. When we understood back in the early 17th century that two perspectives

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.880
were very useful and conducive to the production of knowledge and understanding nature, those

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:25.520
perspectives were realism and naturalism. When we understood that realism and naturalism came

01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:34.000
back under the metaphysics of physicalism. But that was just the one example of naturalism

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.400
and realism that we had. Naturalism and realism are not intrinsically associated with physicalism.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:46.560
You can abandon physicalism without having to abandon realism and naturalism. In other words,

01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:52.720
without having to abandon the notion that there is a world out there made of states that are

01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:58.480
outside my personal agency and which I cannot control or change merely by an act of volition.

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:06.000
And those states obey certain regularities, certain natural regularities such as expressed in the

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.760
chains of causation. Those states do not do what they do because there is an entity outside nature

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:19.040
that is intervening into nature all the time and making things move around, moving the planets

01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.600
around the orbit of the sun like the flying spaghetti monster with its noodley appendages.

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:31.680
That's what we deny. We deny that there is deliberate intervention to explain the dynamics of

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:36.720
nature. We say under naturalism that nature does what it does because it is what it is. And to be

01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:42.000
is to have properties and because nature has the properties it has, it behaves in the way it does.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.360
That's naturalism and there is a world out there that's realism. We can preserve both

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:53.360
while discarding physicalism which makes an extra claim which is that the external states of the

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:59.920
world out there are not experiential fundamentally and it is only the arrangement of those states

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.760
that in certain circumstances generate experience as something epiphenomenal and they don't have

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:13.920
an account for how that miracle could possibly happen. So we reject that but in doing it we

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.440
do not need to reject naturalism and realism. Or just talk about the nervous system as it relates

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:25.360
to IIT. All right, nervous system relates to IIT. I think it means the rest of the peripheral nervous

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:33.840
system below the brain stem. I think that's the question. Does it correlate with experiential

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:40.240
states, the rest of the nervous system? Yeah. Okay, so the brain conventionally is sort of the

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.640
central nervous system but as Bernardo said there's of course a peripheral nervous system

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:51.280
that goes all the way into almost all that innervates our muscles of course but that also

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:59.120
innervates our heart, our kidneys, our liver, our gut, our sexual organs. So all of that and it's

01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:04.160
bi-directional. It goes the information travels from the periphery from these organs into the brain

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:13.040
and from the brain back into the organ and so but the actual substrate of consciousness is probably

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:18.720
in the upper part in the upper echelon at least in normal people who grew up with a normal brain

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:24.320
it's probably in cortex. It doesn't include the PNS, the peripheral nervous system. However,

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:28.800
you can perfectly well be aware of these states of the peripheral nervous system. You can feel

01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.840
hungry, you can feel you know when you have a full belly, you can feel you know when you need to go

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:38.880
to the bathroom, you can feel if you're training yourself and pay attention you can be sensitive

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:45.840
to your heartbeat right and snipers can learn to do that so you can perfectly well become aware of

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.040
these states and furthermore what what the placebo and the nocebo response shows that

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:58.240
that your narrative, your belief can reach out all the way what you believe in your mind

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:05.520
about something some procedure or some ceremony or some person can reach all the way back using

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:13.920
those those axons but now going backwards into the organs and can influence your immune system,

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:19.440
can influence your gut right in psychology this is also called the somatization when people

01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:24.880
have various symptoms but they show up in various parts of their of their body so it's really a

01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.680
two-way communication and and what we've learned over the last hundred years there can be this

01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:36.640
profound influence on your belief since ultimately that's what's known as a placebo or the it's dark

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:43.120
twin the nocebo response that's exactly what it shows when you believe that a particular piece of

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.800
pill subscribed to you by somebody who spent 10 years at a medical school it's called doctor

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:54.560
in a white lab coat and you've read all about those other people who with that same pill have

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:59.440
these wonderful experiences then you too will believe and then you too are much more likely

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:10.240
to have such an experience or to have an amelioration of your symptoms so this shows

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.560
prime sort of mind over matter so I think it's a very important lessons to take home

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:22.560
and it all requires the two-way communication that is the peripheral nervous system thank you

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:27.680
hey guys so I was listening to you know the arguments against personal agency

01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:34.080
and reincarnation and my question is if the argument is made as the personal agency having

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.960
the body and not the body having the personal agency do you see do you see that there is a

01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:45.760
change of standpoint that you are having and a follow-up question can be you know even in

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.640
certain idealist philosophies like Mahayana Buddhism that personal agency is considered

01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:56.400
to be part of physicalism so do you see that possibility as well in your arguments I mean

01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:03.280
I don't see how without I mean once again without a substrate without that being some

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:12.640
substrate I don't see how personal memories or personal agency can can be we need some substrate

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:19.680
without that I don't see how that would happen and if for sophisticated minds like yours and mine

01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:24.800
you need a very sophisticated substrate that that potentially can adopt many many many different

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:33.200
states in the absence of that I don't see you know nothing nothing comes talking from principle

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:39.440
I'm a little bit less strict than Christoph because of this view I have that images do not

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:47.440
need to be complete the hypothesis is not incoherent in principle there could be a hierarchy of

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:54.400
dissociation in nature such that higher level dissociative process that you call then the

01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:02.000
personal agency would further dissociate into what appears to us as a physical body and when

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.840
that under that that's a lower level of dissociation comes to an end and the physical body then

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:12.880
dissolves because it's the image of that process that is no longer going on you sort of fall back

01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:17.600
into that higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy and there is still something

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:24.240
individuated there that's the hypothesis is it in principle incoherent no does it have empirical

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:32.560
backing no and you could say well the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so there

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:40.400
could still be this higher level of dissociation that preserves individual agency yes but isn't

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:50.160
it quite forced because a lot about the body correlates with our inner mental states so

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:56.720
what we are requiring here is that although there is this enormous vast correlation between body

01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:02.560
and our mental states which we consider individual when it comes to this higher level of dissociation

01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:09.200
in the hierarchy it doesn't appear at all on the dashboard it has no physical correlate or in the

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:18.880
words of Christoph it has no substrate that I think stretches plausibility too much I am open

01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.160
to the idea in principle but I don't think we have sufficient reasons to entertain it quite

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:31.120
seriously at this point quickly because yeah it is for professor Christoph and it was regarding

01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:38.800
that famous bet which you had with David Chalmers so I just wanted to know or it was more of a

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:46.320
lighter note but like did you change your quote-unquote position after post that bet or

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:55.360
and if you're not so like why a more serious note like what do you see like David Chalmers one

01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:04.160
and you don't see both IIT and I think a GWT both is not able to answer the question which

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.280
has been you know the hard problem of consciousness that would be my quick question

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:14.240
no so this bet was not about the hard problem it was about the easy problem

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:22.320
the bet was in 25 years from 2098 will the community of scientists that study conscience agree

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:29.040
it's these mechanisms in that part of the brain that are the substrate of consciousness and no

01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:35.760
as of last year the community has not agreed on that but he agrees I mean David Chalmers agrees

01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:41.280
it's a perfectly solvable problem and sooner or later we won't know the answer sooner or later

01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:46.560
we know that these mechanisms in that state give rise to pain or to pleasure or to seeing and

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:51.360
and to reading there's no question about it it's an entirely operational empirical defined

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:57.280
defined project and it does not suffer from the hard problem because it's just correlation

01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:01.920
this part of the brain or these neurons doing this thing correlate with that conscious experience

01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:07.680
massive thank you for both of you for joining us today thank you so much thank you to see you

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:14.720
take care yeah see you all again take care take care see you next Friday all right see you bye bye
