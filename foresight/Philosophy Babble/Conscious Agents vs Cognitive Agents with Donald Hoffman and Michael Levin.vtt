00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
The view in our cognitive scientists today is that we construct our perceptions of reality

00:07.360 --> 00:14.680
in real time. The question was, could we be misinterpreting the content of our perceptual

00:14.680 --> 00:23.080
experiences? And what is our current understanding in a biology of science? According to evolution,

00:23.080 --> 00:29.880
what we perceive with our brain and our senses does not reflect the true natures of the reality.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.640
Why should you care? The implications of such radical finding rock the foundations of our

00:36.640 --> 00:44.440
belief system that space-time is fundamental. In this series, we are delighted to have Professor

00:44.440 --> 00:50.880
Meredith O'Carnative Science, Donald Hoffman, and Professor of Developmental and Synthetic

00:50.880 --> 00:57.320
Biology, Michael Levin joining us today to discuss the idea, and we are going to look

00:57.640 --> 01:03.880
at what is a contest agency. Welcome, Professor Levin. Welcome, Professor Hoffman.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.880
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Absolutely.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.360
How's the new year treating both professors so far? Did you all have a good holiday?

01:16.600 --> 01:22.520
Yeah, sure. Yes, healthy and uneventful, which is good. Yeah, nothing to complain about.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.840
So, any new project for 2023?

01:30.520 --> 01:39.320
Many things. So, in our lab, we have a variety of kind of conceptual and computational projects

01:39.320 --> 01:45.400
and also a bunch of bench work and stuff. So, we have lots of things going on in the areas of,

01:45.400 --> 01:51.240
well, the practicalities come out as cancer, birth defects, regenerative medicine, those kinds of

01:51.240 --> 01:59.560
things. It is our desire to understand collective intelligence, which I think is all intelligence,

01:59.560 --> 02:08.360
and how it is that minds are sort of emerge in the physical world. And so, we are finding new

02:08.360 --> 02:14.680
ways to try to communicate with cellular swarms in the body as a kind of collective intelligence.

02:14.680 --> 02:20.520
And we've got some interesting things on looking at the different competencies of things like

02:20.520 --> 02:26.520
gene regulatory networks, in addition to other models like slime molds and things. So,

02:26.520 --> 02:29.240
yeah, lots of new stuff along those lines.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.560
Busy is going to keep you busy. And Don, you?

02:34.680 --> 02:43.160
That's quite a list. That's an impressive list. Well, we're focused on a number of projects,

02:43.160 --> 02:51.640
but most interesting to me is the physicists tell us that space time is doomed. And they're

02:51.640 --> 02:55.160
not just saying that they're finding new structures beyond space time, right? They're

02:55.160 --> 02:59.720
actually finding these structures like the Amplituhedron and the deepest structure or something

02:59.720 --> 03:06.040
called decorated permutations. But these are just like static structures beyond space time.

03:06.040 --> 03:14.360
We've been looking for a dynamics beyond space time, dynamical system that would actually give

03:14.360 --> 03:20.600
rise to these structures, like the deepest structure is the decorated permutation. So,

03:20.600 --> 03:28.920
we just published a paper last week in which we did that. So, we prove that it's apparently a new

03:28.920 --> 03:35.640
mathematical result that you can canonically map Markov chains, any Markov chain to decorated

03:35.640 --> 03:44.680
permutations. And so, that gives us a window now to start to interpret these structures beyond

03:44.680 --> 03:49.240
space time in terms of Markovian dynamics. And so, that's what we're doing now. So, we have

03:51.000 --> 03:57.880
the project I'm working on now is to show we have a Markovian dynamics of conscious agents.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.120
That's what made us look after these Markov chain ideas and see if we could, you know,

04:02.120 --> 04:06.360
turn them into decorated permutations. That was the motivation because we already have a Markovian

04:06.360 --> 04:12.360
dynamics of consciousness. And so, that's what we're up to now is, okay, now that we have this map

04:12.360 --> 04:18.520
of our conscious agent dynamics, so as a model of conscious agents beyond space time into decorated

04:18.520 --> 04:27.640
permutations, that now should instruct us exactly how to port specific properties of the conscious

04:27.640 --> 04:32.920
agent dynamics to specific physical properties like mass, momentum, spin, and energy and so

04:32.920 --> 04:40.840
forth. So, that's what I'm excited to do because that link has told us where exactly to look

04:40.840 --> 04:45.160
in our conscious agent dynamics. And so, we're looking there and we're finding some beautiful

04:45.160 --> 04:51.160
mathematical structures and getting hints about how they project to properties in space time. So,

04:51.160 --> 05:00.360
we're trying to, so that's my project to map that out and then make explicit proposals for how

05:01.240 --> 05:08.120
could be tested with the data on the inner structure of protons. So, the scattering

05:09.400 --> 05:14.040
experiments that have been done since the 1960s at Stanford Linear Accelerator and then

05:15.480 --> 05:20.680
much more powerful ones later on. We have given us a tremendous amount of detail about the inner

05:20.680 --> 05:26.440
structure, the quark gluon and so forth structure, the parton structure of, and their momentum

05:26.440 --> 05:32.120
distributions inside protons. So, that's my goal this year is to try to actually predict those

05:32.120 --> 05:37.400
distributions from a theory of conscious agents that's beyond space time. That would be, that would

05:37.400 --> 05:45.400
be a good year. On the 20th of December, Professor Levin tweeted, when I was five, I asked my dad

05:45.400 --> 05:51.960
where a certain toy was that I couldn't find. He said, you know how today's clicks over into

05:51.960 --> 05:58.600
tomorrow while you sleep at night? Well, the toy didn't make it. I wouldn't say that's responsible

05:58.600 --> 06:05.480
for my all weird thinking actions, but I spent a long time thinking about how frame of time and

06:05.480 --> 06:13.000
days works. How some object passed from yesterday to today and how that apparently can fail. And

06:13.000 --> 06:20.040
how we as mine say in yesterday, or successfully make it forward. Try to stay up all night to

06:20.040 --> 06:27.320
catch the transactions very disturbing at the time. Professor Levin, could you speak on the toy

06:27.320 --> 06:35.960
that missing? Yeah, I remember it quite clearly. It was a, it was a, it was some sort of plastic

06:35.960 --> 06:41.400
gun or something like this. And, and I remember my, my, I couldn't find it anywhere. And I'm sure,

06:41.400 --> 06:45.560
I'm sure probably somebody threw it away. And my dad, without skipping a beat, he said, he said,

06:45.560 --> 06:49.080
oh yeah, you know, like at night, when things, you know, go over from today to tomorrow, yeah,

06:49.080 --> 06:53.560
it didn't make it. So, you know, that's it. You can give up. It just didn't make it. And I walked

06:53.560 --> 06:58.680
away thinking, oh my God, that's bad. There's a thought like, like, what, well, what determines

06:58.680 --> 07:02.760
whether things make it? And, and, and what if I don't make it? And, and, and what happens? And

07:02.760 --> 07:07.480
then I tried to stay up, of course, all night wanting to catch that, you know, wanting to catch

07:07.480 --> 07:12.200
that moment. When I wasn't, I wasn't able to, I would just fall asleep somewhere around midnight

07:12.200 --> 07:19.160
and like, dang, I missed it again. But you know, so I don't know how much, how much that was responsible

07:19.160 --> 07:24.920
for some of the strange things I think about. But I do, I do think that one of the things that

07:24.920 --> 07:31.400
I've been thinking about recently is this, which I think it relates that is this notion of a lot

07:31.400 --> 07:35.800
of what we do relates to this notion of selfhood or being a self, you know, what does it mean to be

07:35.800 --> 07:41.640
a permanent or, or not, not a permanent, but a stable cognitive structure? Because much like with

07:41.640 --> 07:46.280
bodies, which are a kind of ship of thesis sort of thing, right, molecules come and go all the

07:46.280 --> 07:51.560
time cells come and go all the time. But something stays the same. So what is that? And what are the

07:51.560 --> 07:56.680
policies that the other cells and molecules are implementing that allows some sort of stable,

07:56.680 --> 08:01.880
large scale collective to remain while the low level parts are swapped out at will. And it's not

08:01.960 --> 08:08.040
always a policy to maintain status quo, it might be more metamorphosis, it might be all kinds of

08:08.040 --> 08:12.680
changes that, you know, regeneration and development may, but, but in any case, you need to maintain

08:12.680 --> 08:19.320
some sort of large scale coherence, even though the parts are changing out all the time. So I was

08:19.320 --> 08:26.200
thinking about this with respect to the cognition as well, if you're going to be a stable mind of

08:26.200 --> 08:33.560
some sort, you need to allow ID and go and you need to be in different states. But it, it can't

08:33.560 --> 08:37.240
be something that just completely erases you, you know, every time you have a new thought, well,

08:37.240 --> 08:42.840
that's it, now you're, you know, now you're gone. So, so, so that that balance with the opposite

08:42.840 --> 08:48.840
idea, which comes from many places, but among them, Buddhist ideas of an impermanent self,

08:48.840 --> 08:54.760
or perhaps an illusory, even, even maybe an illusory self. So I've been, I've been thinking about

08:54.840 --> 08:59.480
that a lot and trying to play with these ideas of stability, but, but changeability and the

08:59.480 --> 09:08.680
robustness and yet plasticity. And one way I now think about this is that the self is, it's not

09:08.680 --> 09:14.680
so much that it's completely illusory, but it, but it has to be recreated at every moment in time.

09:14.680 --> 09:20.760
And what I mean by that is just that, at any given moment right now, everything you know about,

09:20.760 --> 09:25.240
or you think you know about yourself, your past, everything else, you have to reconstruct

09:25.240 --> 09:30.440
from the memory traces in your brain. You don't actually have access to anything that really

09:30.440 --> 09:35.880
happened before, whether they be molecules or, or physiological structures, we actually don't

09:35.880 --> 09:41.320
know what it is really. But whatever it is that you've got hold of right now, you have this narrow

09:42.520 --> 09:48.760
slice of now, which is, I don't know, a couple of hundred milliseconds, maybe, and that's your

09:48.760 --> 09:53.720
self. And then you sort of have to reconstruct everything you think you know, from whatever

09:53.720 --> 09:58.040
memory molecules or, you know, engrams that you find laying around in your, in your brain. That's

09:58.040 --> 10:02.920
your only, and of course, people have played with this, you know, for these sort of, I think,

10:02.920 --> 10:07.240
I think maybe humor, somebody said, you know, or, or Boltzmann brains, you know, this idea that

10:07.240 --> 10:11.480
all your memories could have been created and the really hadn't been, and I don't mean, I don't mean

10:11.480 --> 10:17.480
this, this, this sort of bizarre sceptical thing that can't be disproven. I just mean literally

10:17.480 --> 10:24.120
that at every moment, as a cognitive agent, you have to be constructing a model of yourself from

10:24.120 --> 10:27.960
the evidence that you have, which and where does it come from? Well, whatever engrams happen to be

10:27.960 --> 10:34.920
in your, in your, in your brain. And so this, you know, you can imagine yourself as these like

10:34.920 --> 10:39.720
slices in this, in this, you know, and I'm sure I'm sure this is, you know, as Don was saying,

10:39.720 --> 10:44.120
this probably an outdated view already, but I sort of imagine it as these slices of this, of this

10:44.120 --> 10:50.520
giant space time loaf, so to speak. And each, and each one you're basically, you have to recreate

10:50.520 --> 10:58.040
yourself from scratch. And, and then, and if, and that way, what happens is that you can think of

10:58.040 --> 11:01.400
everything you've done in the past and all the memories that were formed in the past,

11:03.080 --> 11:08.200
patients from a past self to a future self, and everything you're doing now are messages that

11:08.200 --> 11:13.320
you are in fact leaving for your future self in a way, right? Because so the memories that you're

11:13.320 --> 11:17.080
forming now and the things you're doing now are things that some future version of you is going

11:17.080 --> 11:21.880
to be using those to base their model of what the heck is going on and when, and who am I? And,

11:21.880 --> 11:26.280
and of course, there are medical versions of this. So people with anterior grade amnesia,

11:26.280 --> 11:31.080
who can't form new memories, what do they do? They, they, they leave, right? So, so, so you

11:31.080 --> 11:34.920
wake up in the morning, because there's this notepad. And on the notepad, first thing it says is,

11:34.920 --> 11:39.000
Hey, by the way, you've got anterior grade amnesia. This is who you are. And this is what's going on.

11:39.000 --> 11:45.320
And the last thing is, don't forget to, don't forget to write. And so we all do this all the

11:45.320 --> 11:49.320
time. It's just that typically our pads are internal. So that, right? So that's all that is

11:50.120 --> 11:54.040
really the same problem, because you must reconstruct yourself. It's just on a smaller

11:54.040 --> 11:58.680
scale. And, and it's somehow internal. So anyway, that's, that's my, my ramblings on that. That,

11:58.680 --> 12:06.360
that's how I've been thinking about this. Thank you. Don, what did you think the time is then?

12:06.920 --> 12:12.520
Is it a, is it a, you know, space and time? Is it more like a data structure?

12:13.480 --> 12:20.280
Could you speak on that, please? Great question. I'll just say one thing along the lines of what

12:20.280 --> 12:25.880
Mike was saying. I agree with what you're saying, Mike. And it's, and it's quite interesting,

12:25.880 --> 12:31.240
because every time you access those memories, you destroy them. You have to do memory reconciled.

12:31.240 --> 12:36.760
You have to actually rebuild the memories all the time as well. So, so you're rebuilding yourself

12:36.760 --> 12:40.440
all the time. It's not like the memory is there and it's always there. You know, every time you

12:40.440 --> 12:45.720
access it, you have to rebuild it. So that's distracting. And yeah, the framework in which

12:45.720 --> 12:50.520
you're talking like, you know, the space time loaf is, has been the standard, your physicalist

12:50.520 --> 12:57.480
framework, you know, since, since Einstein for, so for over a century now. And, but it's interesting

12:57.480 --> 13:01.880
how the physicists realized that, that, that space time itself isn't, is not fundamental.

13:01.880 --> 13:07.480
And so, so it doesn't mean that those ideas are wrong. It means that that way of thinking about

13:07.480 --> 13:12.520
them will have to be understood at a deeper level, right? We'll have to have a deeper representation

13:12.520 --> 13:19.240
beyond space time and that, you know, of physics or whatever beyond space time that projects down

13:19.240 --> 13:24.360
to the space time loaf and projects down to the processes we see, like memory, reconciliation,

13:24.440 --> 13:30.840
and so forth, the middle processes. So those, so, so the space and time are not fundamental,

13:30.840 --> 13:35.960
you know, then, and the physicists are, the physicists are the ones who are not me. It's

13:35.960 --> 13:42.680
the physicists that are saying space time is doomed. It, their own theories. So quantum field

13:42.680 --> 13:49.080
theory and general relativity together are very clear that it's a data structure that works down

13:49.080 --> 13:55.560
to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and then falls apart. So it's actually a really shallow

13:55.560 --> 14:00.040
data structure. It's 10 to the minus 33, not 10 to the minus 33 trillion,

14:00.040 --> 14:07.160
just 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, the thing falls apart. And so, so that means that, by the

14:07.160 --> 14:15.560
way, time also falls apart at 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So, so I take the physicists up their

14:15.560 --> 14:22.200
word that space time is doomed. And that that means that time is doomed. Right. So your question

14:22.200 --> 14:31.240
was about time. So, so we, and that also, by the way, means that ultimately, the strategy in science

14:31.240 --> 14:41.640
of that, if you go to smaller and smaller scales of space time, you find more and more fundamental

14:41.720 --> 14:47.080
objects and more and more fundamental laws. That's the reductionism. That's precisely the

14:47.080 --> 14:54.360
reductionism I mean. That reductionism is false. It just doesn't work beyond 10 to the minus 33

14:54.360 --> 15:00.520
centimeters. And in fact, it falls apart well before them. You get these UVIR correspondences

15:00.520 --> 15:11.800
that will things up well before that. So, so I think that time is and space are merely interface

15:11.800 --> 15:19.080
concepts that they're, they're what we use to get by in, but they're not the reality and the,

15:19.080 --> 15:24.840
and the reality is something entirely outside space and time. And I'll just mention that our

15:24.840 --> 15:30.600
work in evolution of a natural selection agrees with, with the physicists. Evolution also entails

15:30.600 --> 15:36.120
that space and time and objects in space and time are not fundamental. So, so that means that

15:36.120 --> 15:41.640
neurons don't exist when they're not perceived, but, but, but that is not to put down neurobiology.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.160
In fact, what I say is we need more money for neurobiology because we realize it's a lot harder

15:47.160 --> 15:51.400
than we ever thought. We thought, you know, there's 86 billion neurons in the brain and,

15:51.400 --> 15:56.120
you know, that's a hard problem, but, but that's just the interface representation. That's, that's

15:56.120 --> 16:02.120
the dumb down version. The real complex version is being hidden from us. And we have to really reverse

16:02.120 --> 16:07.320
engineer neurobiology and space time to something deeper. It's going to be far more complicated

16:07.320 --> 16:11.960
and we'll have to see how it projects down to space time. So, so I think that, that time is,

16:11.960 --> 16:16.680
is not fundamental. And in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents,

16:17.640 --> 16:24.520
there is no entropic arrow of time necessary in the dynamics. So, we can have a dynamics in which

16:24.520 --> 16:31.080
there is a sequence parameter, but there is the entropy does not increase. But it turns out it's

16:31.080 --> 16:39.240
a theorem that if you take a projection of the dynamics on by say conditional probability,

16:39.240 --> 16:44.280
that any projected view of the dynamics, you'll get a new dynamics that's a, you know, projection

16:44.280 --> 16:49.160
of the bigger dynamics of the fundamental dynamic, that new dynamics will have an arrow of time.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.920
Just because of the loss of information that happened in the projection process.

16:55.640 --> 17:03.480
So, so that makes sense. Space time is just our virtual reality headset. It's a projection. It loses

17:03.480 --> 17:10.360
information. We have an arrow of time because of that loss of information. In other words, time

17:11.080 --> 17:17.720
is not an insight into the nature of reality. It's just an artifact of the projection process,

17:17.720 --> 17:23.880
purely an artifact and not an, not an insight. There's more to say, but I'll stop there because

17:23.880 --> 17:30.680
I don't want to do it. Mike, do you agree? Or you have anything to add to that, Mike?

17:30.680 --> 17:35.960
Yeah. Well, I think, I think it's a, it's a, it's a very profound idea. And, and I think that

17:36.920 --> 17:45.000
I, I wonder if we can generalize that to say that it's almost, it's almost guaranteed that

17:46.200 --> 17:56.440
agents will, will build models of their world that may or may not agree with other agents

17:56.440 --> 18:03.800
models of their world, because as Don has very nicely shown rigorously, evolution isn't looking

18:03.880 --> 18:10.360
for that. It's just looking for expedient representations. And so it's entirely possible

18:10.360 --> 18:14.600
that there are, I mean, so, so Chris Fields and I work on this kind of stuff a lot from the perspective

18:14.600 --> 18:21.160
of observers and this idea that everything is some observer's vantage point description.

18:21.720 --> 18:26.440
And so I think it makes complete sense to me that from certain vantage points,

18:27.400 --> 18:31.160
things look like there's, there's space and time, but you know, it's like, it's like,

18:31.160 --> 18:34.840
we have mathematical tools, you know, neural nets and things like that, that will

18:34.840 --> 18:40.280
take, take their experience and project it into some crazy space where you can't make heads of

18:40.280 --> 18:44.760
tails of what the principal components are. And, and, and because, and this is what happens to,

18:44.760 --> 18:49.160
to us all, we make, we make some kind of representation that seems to be good enough

18:49.160 --> 18:54.280
for survival and various other things. But, but none of that should be taken as, as, as,

18:54.280 --> 18:59.400
as fundamental. And the other, the other thing that this is maybe stepping away a little bit,

18:59.480 --> 19:05.640
but, but I think it bears on this, on this topic as far as, you know, space, space and time have

19:05.640 --> 19:11.160
served well, they've in physics, right, they've done a nice job and everything. But I think,

19:11.160 --> 19:15.240
I think we have to ask somebody, somebody once said, I remember who it was that them,

19:16.360 --> 19:20.520
if you show me the fishing net that you're using, I'll show you the fish you're going to catch,

19:20.520 --> 19:25.480
which is that we have to think about what are these tools good for and what are they not good for.

19:25.560 --> 19:29.960
And one of the things that I've been increasingly sort of focusing on this, this idea that

19:31.080 --> 19:38.760
the world looks like a mechanical, mechanistic place when you use tools that are low agency

19:38.760 --> 19:44.760
tools. So when you use voltmeters and rulers and things like this, all you're ever going to see

19:44.760 --> 19:48.920
is low agency stuff, you're going to see things that look like mechanism. Of course,

19:48.920 --> 19:52.040
it's going to look like mechanism because that's the, that's the lens you're using.

19:52.600 --> 19:57.480
And so we can't then assume that, well, that must be right. And just assume that, okay,

19:57.480 --> 20:02.280
it's all got to be bottom up because those are the tools that we use. And what if, what if

20:03.240 --> 20:09.240
the things you're going to find have to be in some impedance match, almost are

20:10.840 --> 20:16.520
the tools that you're using. And so we suppose you're looking for things like agents or you're

20:16.520 --> 20:21.640
looking for virtual governors or top-down controllers, you're not going to find that

20:22.200 --> 20:27.320
with low agency tools. What can you find that with? Well, you find it with brains and you find it

20:27.320 --> 20:34.760
with minds that are primed to look for agency. These things that are, we don't have a voltmeter

20:34.760 --> 20:44.120
that measures causal information, new theory and whatnot. These things that Eric Hall and other

20:44.120 --> 20:49.160
folks study these high level, integrated information and all that. You don't have a voltmeter

20:49.240 --> 20:53.960
that, of course you don't. But, and so you don't find any of that when you use those tools all you

20:53.960 --> 21:00.040
ever see as mechanism. But when you look at the world using a tool, for example, our own mind

21:00.040 --> 21:05.800
and our observational system, then we're very good at detecting agency. Of course, we make mistakes

21:05.800 --> 21:11.080
in both directions, right? We have false positive and false negatives. But minds are really good

21:11.080 --> 21:17.160
tools to find other minds, voltmeters or not. And so, right? So maybe there's something there.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.720
Maybe it's this idea that, yes, of course, these things have been with us and they do a nice job

21:22.280 --> 21:26.200
on the kinds of things that they're good at, which is describing mechanical,

21:26.200 --> 21:31.720
mechanistic interactions. And I think what Don has highlighted very, very effectively is that

21:31.720 --> 21:37.560
we cannot assume that, well, that's our fishing net and that's all there is to find. That's clearly,

21:37.560 --> 21:41.640
right? They're letting us find certain kinds of things and they're also obscuring lots of other

21:41.640 --> 21:48.600
important things. Thank you. So let me summarize it, Don. So you're saying no physical objects,

21:48.600 --> 21:54.200
including my body, it's conscious, strictly speaking, right? So my brain isn't conscious

21:54.200 --> 22:01.320
because my brain, in fact, doesn't even exist. And then space time is not fundamental. So this

22:01.320 --> 22:06.280
standard view that we all took for granted, objective reality we see with our eyes is not

22:06.920 --> 22:17.320
surviving bonkers. So having this view with the evolution theory, has it affected your

22:17.320 --> 22:20.360
perceptions and your behavior when you come to interacting with the world?

22:23.080 --> 22:29.000
Yes. And I think the way you put it is well put. And what Mike has been saying is,

22:29.960 --> 22:37.160
I completely agree. And it's brilliant. And the fishing net example is a really good example

22:37.160 --> 22:41.480
that, you know, we don't see the world as it is. We see it through the lens of our own concepts and

22:41.480 --> 22:51.960
the way we, you know, what we do. And there's no escaping that. And so in effect, as well,

22:51.960 --> 22:57.000
as we talked about, you have to recreate yourself all the time, right? That was Mike saying,

22:57.080 --> 23:05.800
you're always recreating yourself all the time. Well, you're also recreating the world all the

23:05.800 --> 23:12.520
time. So I have a body when I look, and I have neurons when I look. And when I don't look,

23:12.520 --> 23:17.960
they're not there. So every time I look. So this is really quite,

23:20.280 --> 23:25.400
if you're in a virtual reality game, your avatar is there only when you see it.

23:26.360 --> 23:32.040
And the avatar that someone else sees of you is there when they see it. And as soon as they

23:32.040 --> 23:35.720
turn their heads somewhere else, that avatar is gone. And they're looking at something else.

23:35.720 --> 23:41.880
And so, yeah, we're recreating all the objects inside of space and time on the fly as needed.

23:41.880 --> 23:47.160
And that includes all of my neurons and my body. So these things, you know, it's,

23:48.040 --> 23:51.480
and we have the illusion that they're there all the time, because every time I look, I see it.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.280
But you can get the same illusion in virtual reality, right? You know, if you're playing a

23:56.280 --> 23:59.880
good game, you can get immersed in the game. Every time I look over to the right, I see the mountain.

24:00.760 --> 24:04.040
So it must mean the mountains there all the time. No, no, you're only rendering the mountain when

24:04.040 --> 24:08.440
you look. The fact is, you always render the mountain every time you look that direction,

24:08.440 --> 24:11.800
but that doesn't mean the mountain was there. You still have to create it all the time.

24:11.800 --> 24:17.240
There is something, there is a reality. But so we get confused, because when we go, well,

24:17.240 --> 24:21.080
there must be some reality. Yeah, absolutely, there is a reality. It's just not inside space

24:21.080 --> 24:25.560
and time, because it's not inside the virtual reality, because there you have to render everything

24:25.560 --> 24:33.640
for it to exist in the only exists in the rendering process. So yes, this has a personal impact,

24:34.200 --> 24:43.320
right? I mean, first, when I first realized, I had to just sit down and to absorb it. And that was

24:44.280 --> 24:51.560
35 years ago. And I'm still absorbing it. And it's a shock to me. And I think it's a shock to

24:51.560 --> 24:58.040
almost everybody, except maybe, you know, advanced meditators and so forth. You know, maybe for them

24:58.040 --> 25:05.240
is not as much of a shock, but it's still a shock to the system. And I think Piaget gave us the very

25:05.240 --> 25:12.680
famous child psychologist Piaget gave us some insight as to why it's so shocking. And he pointed

25:12.760 --> 25:21.080
out that we're programmed to believe in what he called object permanence. He thought we got object

25:21.080 --> 25:27.240
permanence by 18 months. Later studies showed that it was probably more like a three or four months.

25:27.800 --> 25:34.040
So this is before we're rational, right? We're not reasoning and logically thinking about things.

25:34.040 --> 25:40.280
We're just programmed to believe that that doll exists, and will continue to exist,

25:40.280 --> 25:46.840
even if it's behind a pillow when I can't see it. Piaget was looking at, you know, babies with

25:46.840 --> 25:50.920
dolls. When are they going to go looking for the doll that they can't see? You know, when do they

25:50.920 --> 25:58.520
believe the doll still exists? And so we're programmed to, so our belief that the sun exists

25:58.520 --> 26:08.120
even when we don't look is not, we didn't come to that belief based on rational, logical, cold

26:08.120 --> 26:15.880
logic. We came to it at three months of age because we're programmed to believe that. And so

26:17.240 --> 26:25.720
that's why my merely intellectual understanding that it's false has not yet

26:27.240 --> 26:33.320
penetrated my emotional work. It's still quite a shock emotionally, absolutely.

26:34.280 --> 26:38.760
Mike, has it changed your perceptions of the world?

26:39.720 --> 26:47.240
Yeah. Well, I guess what I want to say, two things. One about things that don't change and one

26:47.240 --> 26:56.200
about things that do. I once had lunch with a philosopher who was a very strong skeptic on

26:56.200 --> 27:03.240
Free Will. And when the waitress came over and said, so, Professor X, what kind of soup will you

27:03.240 --> 27:09.960
have? And she said, well, let me think. I said, hey, what are you doing? Why don't you sit back

27:09.960 --> 27:16.040
and see what soup gets ordered? What are you doing choosing a soup here? And so that's just

27:16.040 --> 27:19.800
to say that. I mean, I understand, of course, the argument and everything. But the point is

27:20.840 --> 27:25.240
that's one of those things that you can be a skeptic about Free Will. But I don't think you

27:25.240 --> 27:30.360
can live your life. I think it's one of those views that is just impossible to connect with on

27:30.360 --> 27:36.440
a practical level for a strong reason that we can talk about. I think actually that and object

27:36.440 --> 27:43.160
permanence goes back to the bacterial, microbial level. And so we can talk about that. But I think

27:43.160 --> 27:51.320
it is impossible for a coherent mind that evolved under realistic constraints to not believe in

27:51.320 --> 27:55.880
being an agent that does things. I think, right, I just don't think you can, no matter what you

27:55.880 --> 28:02.520
write about Free Will, I don't think you can live. The thing that I think does change some of these

28:02.520 --> 28:08.120
things is this. And this is just a question I'll pose to all of you. And whoever's listening,

28:08.120 --> 28:13.080
I think it's an interesting question. I've done a poll of all my friends with this. Imagine, and

28:13.080 --> 28:20.360
I think people split into two types of people along this question. Imagine some pleasant

28:20.440 --> 28:26.840
experience that you would be willing to pay $100. It's a nice massage or something, whatever it

28:26.840 --> 28:30.760
is. It's a nice, it's a nice discreet experience that you could have. And so I'm going to give you

28:30.760 --> 28:36.760
two choices. You can have that experience right now, but you're going to have no memory of it

28:36.760 --> 28:41.080
later. None, it's wiped, it wipes your memory. So let's say, you know, you've always wanted to go

28:41.080 --> 28:47.080
skydiving and it's free. But afterwards, you will have no memory of having done it. Okay, so that's

28:47.080 --> 28:52.040
option one. Option two is the exact opposite. We're not going to do it, but you're going to

28:52.040 --> 28:58.120
have a memory of having done it. But you're not actually going to get to do it now. So which do

28:58.120 --> 29:04.360
you prefer? Right? And what I find is that people have very strong feelings about this.

29:05.400 --> 29:09.000
But about half of the people I talk to, and it's really about half and half, I think,

29:09.000 --> 29:15.240
people that I talk to, half of them say, well, the now moment is going to be gone anyway. All

29:15.320 --> 29:19.320
I really have are memories of anything, you know, I don't care what happens now. Give me the memory

29:19.320 --> 29:23.560
of this beautiful, you know, skydive or whatever. And somebody else will say, well, who wants to

29:23.560 --> 29:28.440
go around collecting memories? I like experiences. I want to have the experience. Everything else is

29:28.440 --> 29:32.840
fake. I live in the now. Let's do it. And so I don't care if I don't remember it afterwards.

29:33.720 --> 29:39.400
And so this is a really interesting, I think, division point of how you see yourself. Do you

29:39.400 --> 29:45.160
see yourself as this like evanescent agent? And then, and then, you know, three hours from now,

29:45.160 --> 29:50.120
that's not really going to be me anyway. So who cares what that I'm how I want the experience

29:50.120 --> 29:55.080
now, that's all that exists. And then you've got the people who are like, no, no, all I am is,

29:55.080 --> 29:59.240
is this, you know, collection of memory. So let's add to that. And there is no now, it'll be gone

29:59.240 --> 30:05.080
shortly. So, so I think pondering that one and thinking about which type you are, I think, I

30:05.080 --> 30:10.360
think that's kind of instructive and and how and how different people can can really differ on that.

30:11.960 --> 30:19.640
So yeah, it's a it's a really interesting thing. So I my memories, my memory is not that good.

30:20.360 --> 30:25.960
I really it just like when when I first read when I when I was young, I first read about this,

30:25.960 --> 30:30.520
this idea that your memories could be false. I had, I was like, yeah, of course, I could barely

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
I mean, my memory, I don't know, you know, I don't really trust it that much anyway, it seemed to

30:35.000 --> 30:39.800
make perfect sense. And so I'm one of these guys who takes lots of pictures and, you know, records

30:39.800 --> 30:46.520
everything because that's I find it hard to kind of replay it later. So so from from from that

30:46.520 --> 30:55.400
perspective, I can I can sort of see both views. I think that my memories aren't worth the raw

30:55.400 --> 30:59.640
memories aren't worth all that much. So I would I would take the immediate experience. But but in

30:59.640 --> 31:05.480
real life, I sort of augment that with with all kinds of stuff, right? So I think tons of photographs

31:05.480 --> 31:10.360
and videos and whatnot. So yeah, I don't know, I think it's a it's a profound set of questions.

31:10.920 --> 31:16.920
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I have I have a silly questions. So dinosaurs not real?

31:18.200 --> 31:24.680
Both of you. So are you saying that dinosaurs is not real? Then it's just a perceptions of us then

31:24.920 --> 31:26.360
the vi has said.

31:29.080 --> 31:35.640
Well, so I'll go after that. So it's quite good. I mean, so, you know, dinosaurs disappeared 65

31:35.640 --> 31:40.760
million years ago or something like that, right? And and and that's that's our space time story. And

31:40.760 --> 31:49.240
it's I think it's a good story. But but I would say, yes, there there is some reality. But it's

31:49.720 --> 31:55.320
not in space and time. And if you get you get the right answer, if you think about virtual

31:55.320 --> 32:02.360
reality most of the time. So you just always think about virtual reality. And so is is that car

32:02.360 --> 32:08.600
that you're seeing in virtual reality? Is it really there? Well, no, it's not. It's there when you

32:08.600 --> 32:13.880
look. Is there some reality that is causing you to see that car? Yeah, but it's not a car. It's

32:13.960 --> 32:19.480
maybe some supercomputer or something outside of your virtual reality. So so so yeah, we we will

32:19.480 --> 32:25.560
find dinosaur bones and we will date them a 65 million years. And that's our virtual reality

32:26.680 --> 32:33.240
perception of it. There is there is some deeper reality that you know, that's real. But but this

32:33.240 --> 32:40.840
is as Mike is saying, we have to recreate this stuff all the time on the fly. And and and so so

32:41.000 --> 32:46.600
yeah, that dinosaur experience that you're having when you dig up that bone right now.

32:48.680 --> 32:57.320
That experience only exists in the moment. And that bone didn't exist as a bone until you

32:57.320 --> 33:05.160
perceived it. There is some other reality that does anybody else who wants to go and dig in

33:05.160 --> 33:10.680
that area to see the bone, right? So you'll all agree. But you also agree in virtual reality,

33:10.680 --> 33:13.800
say that, you know, if you're playing Grand Theft Auto, that everybody would agree. Oh, yeah,

33:13.800 --> 33:18.280
you're racing a green Porsche. Everybody agrees that you're racing a green Porsche. That doesn't

33:18.280 --> 33:22.520
mean that there really is a green Porsche. It just means everybody agrees. And so we all agree

33:22.520 --> 33:26.760
that we see dinosaurs and we all agree that in our heads up, they look like they're 65 million

33:26.760 --> 33:32.600
years old or older. But agreement doesn't mean that it has a preexisting reality.

33:32.600 --> 33:37.640
So are you saying Max Delbert? He was

33:38.600 --> 33:40.200
No, no, who's who's talking right now?

33:41.560 --> 33:47.160
All right, it's one of the audience. Can we move on quickly done? Sorry about that.

33:48.120 --> 33:55.240
Briefly talk about your model and catch on on the conscious agency so that you and Mike could

33:55.240 --> 34:01.320
compare the two models. So you talk on your conscious agency and the mathematical sites of

34:01.320 --> 34:07.640
it and then Mike could unpack it from his perspective on the biology side of it. Shall

34:07.640 --> 34:12.920
we go on that? Sure, sure. Back to the Max Delbert thing later on in the Q&A. Absolutely. So I

34:12.920 --> 34:20.280
didn't want to rudely stop anybody. I just didn't know who was talking. So so the conscious agent

34:20.280 --> 34:27.080
model is a precise model of consciousness. I'm not saying it's the right model,

34:27.080 --> 34:31.800
but it's at least mathematically precise in which we have agents that have experiences

34:31.800 --> 34:36.680
and based on those experiences, they take actions that affect the experiences of other conscious

34:36.680 --> 34:43.800
agents of interacting conscious agents. And the mathematics is basically Markovian. It's a

34:43.800 --> 34:50.840
Markov chain that you get on this collection, this network of conscious agents. And

34:51.320 --> 34:56.920
one of the things that we're doing right now in the model, which is for our next paper, which is

34:56.920 --> 35:03.560
really fun, is looking at the role of observation. So the only thing to observe is other consciousnesses,

35:03.560 --> 35:09.000
right? The consciousnesses are observing consciousnesses. And it's a theorem of this theory

35:09.000 --> 35:16.680
that any collection of consciousness agents is itself a bigger agent. So ultimately, the math

35:17.480 --> 35:22.280
says there's one agent. But it also tells us that we can never write down the one agent because

35:22.280 --> 35:28.280
it would be infinitely long. So you can't write it down. So it's interesting that the theory says

35:28.280 --> 35:33.480
there is one conscious agent, but it will transcend any precise mathematical description.

35:33.480 --> 35:38.040
But we can build as big an agent as we want. And so that's what we have to do. So we have to be

35:38.040 --> 35:44.840
modest and build big agents, but we can't build the one agent. And the only thing there is to

35:44.920 --> 35:50.040
observe is consciousness. And it's only conscious agents that are there to observe it. So what we

35:50.040 --> 35:57.160
can do is we can take a huge agent, which has a huge number of experiences, a huge number of states

35:57.160 --> 36:03.240
that it perceives. So maybe, you know, a billion by it's a billion states, a billion experiences

36:03.240 --> 36:12.040
that it can have. And we can then take any subset of states from it, maybe just 100,000 over or

36:12.040 --> 36:18.600
2 million. And that will also correspond to a sub agent. So this will be a sub agent of this

36:18.600 --> 36:25.400
bigger agent. And then we can take the Markovian dynamics of the big agent and do what's called

36:25.400 --> 36:32.120
a trace chain. We can look at the Markovian dynamics that's induced on the little agent

36:34.360 --> 36:38.440
as a consequence of the big dynamics. So it's called a trace chain. So every time,

36:39.080 --> 36:43.880
most of the time, the state of the big agent is not in the state of one of the states of

36:43.880 --> 36:48.840
the little agent. But when it does, then we will, you know, that little agent will get activated

36:48.840 --> 36:54.360
and we can then build its Markov kernel. You know, we can actually describe over time what

36:54.360 --> 36:58.040
is Markovian kernel is. So there's some big Markovian kernel, but we can induce

36:59.560 --> 37:04.600
little Markovian kernels on all the sub agents. So if you have a big agent with N

37:05.320 --> 37:12.760
states and experiences that it can perceive, then there are two to the N sub agents,

37:12.760 --> 37:17.720
including the original agent, two to the N sub agents. So, and so you have two to the N

37:20.120 --> 37:25.160
different Markovian kernels or trace chains that you can look at. And so you're now going

37:25.160 --> 37:31.480
to get a very interesting group structure. So how do the different agents see the deeper reality?

37:31.560 --> 37:37.000
So you will, I bet we'll see in some cases, we can get a Lorentz transformation relating them

37:37.000 --> 37:41.000
or Euclidean transformation. So we will start to see how the different agents

37:43.320 --> 37:49.240
perceptions differ systematically as you change the agent. But the other thing that is interesting

37:49.240 --> 37:54.840
is that not only the, we might call the spatial window, which particular subset of states you're

37:54.840 --> 37:59.880
using, but how many steps of the chain do you want to look at? Do you want to look at only 50

37:59.880 --> 38:04.760
steps or 100 or a billion or a trillion? I mean, ultimately Markov chains are supposed to go off

38:04.760 --> 38:13.560
to infinity. But imagining finite temporal windows, and it turns out when you do that,

38:14.280 --> 38:21.320
what each sub agent will see depends almost entirely on this temporal window as well as the

38:21.320 --> 38:28.120
spatial window. So when you have a very small temporal window, you will, and I can go into the

38:28.120 --> 38:34.600
mathematics of this, but what you will see with small temporal windows is what we believe will

38:34.600 --> 38:41.400
turn out to be bosons in physics. These are massless particles. So Don, and you'll see

38:41.400 --> 38:48.440
tons of bosons. So Don, the matter matter sites of it, right? The W represents the world, and then

38:48.440 --> 38:54.920
you got the perceived, the P, and then you got the A, the R, and then you got the measurable,

38:54.920 --> 39:01.480
you got the measurable space between the experience, the acts, and then the action, the G.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.720
So what is that measurable experience that you're measuring though?

39:07.960 --> 39:14.280
So what are those measurable spaces? Yeah. So those measurable spaces are probability spaces.

39:15.240 --> 39:21.560
So anytime that you have some kind of probabilistic dynamics, you need to have a probability

39:21.560 --> 39:26.440
space in which the dynamics can take place. And so that's the case with these Markovian

39:26.440 --> 39:31.240
dynamics. And what's interesting is I didn't think about that for the longest time. We, you know,

39:31.960 --> 39:36.440
it's just derigure that if you're going to write down a, you know, probability,

39:37.880 --> 39:41.720
then you have to write down a probability space. And I didn't even think about what the probability

39:41.720 --> 39:47.800
so years later, but I realized that I was only focused on the experiences. But what about the

39:47.880 --> 39:53.320
probability space in which they occur? And it seems to me that a natural interpretation

39:53.320 --> 39:59.960
of the probability space itself is to be interpreted as pure awareness without any

39:59.960 --> 40:04.360
particular content, something that spiritual traditions have talked about for a long time.

40:04.360 --> 40:09.160
So here is the pure awareness, which is the potential. I'm sorry.

40:09.960 --> 40:18.040
Is it the verdict you're talking about, the Indian philosophy about the observer position,

40:18.040 --> 40:23.320
the afman, go backward to the brahman? Is that the one that you're talking about?

40:24.600 --> 40:30.360
That would be, I think that's one example of it. I think all the different spiritual traditions

40:30.360 --> 40:35.800
point with their own words to the same kind of thing. And what was interesting to me was,

40:35.800 --> 40:40.360
I mean, I wasn't trying to model that. I just was trying to do the math and I had to write

40:40.360 --> 40:46.200
down a probability space. And I didn't even think about it. And it was only years that

40:46.200 --> 40:51.160
probability space. And the only interpretation that makes sense is something along the lines of this

40:52.440 --> 40:58.120
unbounded potential for experience, namely awareness of pure awareness without any particular

40:58.120 --> 41:06.040
content. And then many spiritual traditions will then say, that is what you are. You are

41:06.040 --> 41:11.800
not the particular content, this particular body or this particular color that you're seeing or

41:11.800 --> 41:16.200
this particular headache that you're feeling. That's not what you are. Those are just experiences

41:16.200 --> 41:23.480
that are arising in this fundamental awareness. And you are that fundamental awareness, not just

41:23.480 --> 41:33.480
the things that arise. So Don, the end represents our selfhood, the observer position. That's where

41:33.480 --> 41:42.920
the end comes in. And that triangle, mathematical graph. Oh, well, in the perception, decision,

41:42.920 --> 41:48.520
action loop, and there's also an integer n that we have there, that was simply just to

41:49.400 --> 41:54.440
a counter for the number of steps of the Markovian Internet. So you need a counter,

41:54.440 --> 42:01.560
in some sense, to say what step of the chain you're in. So that was just a technical thing.

42:02.760 --> 42:07.720
It's not time. It's just the sequence counter of the Markov chain.

42:09.560 --> 42:17.160
Thank you, Mike. Yeah. So I end up basically at the same point as Don. And let me walk it

42:17.160 --> 42:24.440
backwards towards the biology of where I think it comes from. If you didn't already know what it

42:24.440 --> 42:29.160
was to communicate with a human and somebody showed you a three pound, you know, three and a half

42:29.160 --> 42:34.760
pound brain, and they say, so how many, how many cells do you think you think are in there? Well,

42:34.760 --> 42:40.600
we have absolutely no idea because, because I priori, you don't really know what the dense,

42:40.600 --> 42:45.560
you know, the the agential density of this material is, you have no idea. And, and the thing is that,

42:45.640 --> 42:50.040
and then of course, in, you know, you get to split brain patients and dissociative states, we still

42:50.040 --> 42:56.280
actually, it's still not super clear, you know, how to count these things. But, but it's interesting

42:56.280 --> 43:02.440
that in biology, every, every cell is some other cells neighbor. In fact, every cell, every cellular

43:02.440 --> 43:06.760
neighbor is some other cells external environment. And so this question of, you know, what Don was

43:06.760 --> 43:14.680
saying of different, different cells, sort of being within the kind of a larger structure,

43:14.680 --> 43:22.040
this is almost guaranteed because, because there is no obvious and unambiguous way to say where

43:22.040 --> 43:29.240
any one self ends and any other self begins. And biology is always multi scale and at every,

43:29.240 --> 43:33.560
everything is made up, you know, so, so like Descartes was looking, he liked the pineal gland

43:33.560 --> 43:38.440
because there was just one of them. But one of what if you look inside, it's full of cell,

43:38.440 --> 43:42.040
the thing's full of cells, there's not one of anything. And if you look inside the cells,

43:42.120 --> 43:45.800
guess what you find, you find a bunch of molecules. I mean, there really is no one of

43:45.800 --> 43:49.960
anything, everything is made of sort of components. And, and you really start to see this when you

43:49.960 --> 43:54.520
look at basic embryogenesis, which I think is super important here, it's this, this journey

43:54.520 --> 43:59.480
that each of us took from being a an unfertilized, the oocyte, you know, this blob of chemicals

43:59.480 --> 44:04.200
into whatever it is that we are now. Let's just look at the early time points of this, right? So,

44:04.200 --> 44:10.440
so, so what happens is you have, you have this embryonic blastoderm. So it's a flat in, in the

44:10.440 --> 44:16.040
mammals and birds, it's like this flat disc. And okay, 50,000 cells or something. So you look at

44:16.040 --> 44:21.560
this thing, and we say, oh, look, there's, that's an embryo. Now, what did you just count as an

44:21.560 --> 44:26.200
embryo? There's one of what, well, there's 50,000 cells, what is there one of? Well, there's one

44:26.200 --> 44:33.960
of if you put a particular lens on this thing, and you say, I'm going to count the system that

44:33.960 --> 44:39.160
attempts to that is going to use energy and attempt to build a particular structure. Basically,

44:39.160 --> 44:43.720
what I'm going to count is goal directed systems. I'm going to say how many different

44:43.720 --> 44:47.320
goal directed systems are there. And what you will find is that all of these cells will work

44:47.320 --> 44:51.080
together towards a particular anatomical goal. You can the other way to think about it, if you

44:51.080 --> 44:55.240
don't like go talk, is that it's trying to reach a particular region of anatomical morphous space,

44:55.240 --> 45:00.040
where you've got a couple eyes, you've got the right number of toes, all that stuff. So, so a

45:00.040 --> 45:03.640
bunch of these cells get together, and they're all going to work on this one construction project.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.880
Everybody agrees every step, this is what they're, this is what they're working on. Okay, so, so,

45:07.880 --> 45:11.320
so now you've counted one, you say, well, there you go, that's a, that's a separate self, it's a

45:11.320 --> 45:15.000
separate consciousness, it's going to be a human embryo, let's say we know what that looks like.

45:15.000 --> 45:22.680
Except that if you were to come along at that early stage, and I've done this in avian with,

45:22.680 --> 45:26.920
with chicken eggs and things like this, when I was a grad student, you take a little needle,

45:26.920 --> 45:31.720
and you make a couple of scratches in that blastoderm. Eventually, it's going to heal up,

45:31.720 --> 45:36.840
they're going to heal. But before they heal, what happens is that every group of cells that cannot

45:36.840 --> 45:41.640
feel the other cells, because you put a scratch between them, decides that, well, it's just me,

45:41.640 --> 45:47.160
then. And so they form an embryo, and every island forms an embryo, and then when they heal,

45:47.160 --> 45:52.280
you have conjoined twins, and or triplets or whatever. So the question of, so you look at an

45:52.280 --> 45:59.480
embryo, and you say, well, how many are in there? It could be anywhere from zero to some small

45:59.480 --> 46:05.560
number of them, because that question is decided on the fly. It is not pre-programmed, it is decided

46:05.560 --> 46:11.560
on the fly by the physiology of a bunch of cells making a decision of how they're going to coalesce

46:11.560 --> 46:16.920
towards one machine that's going to take this morphogenetic journey, this movement through

46:16.920 --> 46:23.720
anatomical morphospace. So what happens then is that you realize that what you've got is you've

46:23.720 --> 46:29.720
got this almost like this Freudian ocean of possibility, these 50,000 cells, and out of them

46:29.720 --> 46:35.000
might come some number of intelligences. And once you realize that that's the case, and that

46:35.800 --> 46:40.600
within this one thing, there could be three different conjoined twins, and this, of course,

46:40.600 --> 46:45.560
happens in humans as well as other animals, then you realize that fine, the adult human body,

46:45.560 --> 46:53.000
or any animal body, also has within it various collectives, such as organs and various other

46:53.000 --> 47:01.320
things that for the exact same, and so I'll just back up and say that I don't have a theory of

47:01.400 --> 47:07.080
consciousness that I'm sort of propagating, like many other people do, I don't have my own, maybe

47:07.080 --> 47:11.240
I will at some point, I don't now, so I don't have too much to say about consciousness except this.

47:12.280 --> 47:18.200
All, as far as I can tell, all of the theories of consciousness that try to explain why brains

47:18.200 --> 47:23.480
are associated with consciousness in some way, for the exact same reason that all of those theories

47:23.480 --> 47:28.600
pick the brain to be able to do it, pretty much every tissue in your body should be judged as

47:28.600 --> 47:34.280
conscious, because all of these things that these theories talk about, and let's say the neuroscience

47:34.280 --> 47:38.680
theories, they lean on things like, well, there are these integrated electrical networks and we've

47:38.680 --> 47:43.240
got some neurotransmitters and some ion channel, all of this stuff exists all over your body.

47:43.240 --> 47:50.280
I have yet to come across a theory of consciousness that tells you why the brain is different from

47:50.280 --> 47:55.400
anything else. And when you sort of start to poke at it, they say, well, then it's the magnetic

47:55.400 --> 47:58.840
field of it. They say, okay, how about the magnetic field of the liver? Why is that different?

47:58.840 --> 48:02.520
Well, I guess it probably isn't. I mean, that's right, that's where you end up. There's just no

48:02.520 --> 48:07.960
one has drawn that line for a very good reason, because neurons evolved from systems that were

48:07.960 --> 48:12.120
other cell types that were using these electrical communications long before brain showed up.

48:12.120 --> 48:18.280
So for the same reason that you might now, consciousness is not going to be verbal consciousness,

48:18.280 --> 48:24.360
you're not going to talk to it using using language, and you're probably not aware of it

48:24.360 --> 48:29.160
anymore than you are aware of your other nonverbal hemisphere and the opinions that it has that

48:29.160 --> 48:33.000
you don't even know about, because you're not aware of it. But it's entirely plausible,

48:33.000 --> 48:39.320
given the developmental biology, that we are these nested hierarchies of diverse

48:39.320 --> 48:43.960
conscious agents that are all having experiences and solving problems in different spaces,

48:43.960 --> 48:49.560
all kinds of weird spaces. So transcriptional, so gene expression spaces, metabolic spaces,

48:49.560 --> 48:54.600
physiological spaces, anatomical spaces, we love the three-dimensional sort of space of

48:54.600 --> 48:59.320
the where it's easy for us to recognize intelligence, but that's just our own limitation.

49:00.760 --> 49:07.000
If you had a, just imagine that you had a primary sense of your own blood chemistry,

49:07.000 --> 49:11.800
instead of, in addition to your retina that looks outwards for medium-sized objects moving at medium

49:11.800 --> 49:15.800
speeds, you would also have an internal sensor of your blood chemistry and you could feel it.

49:15.800 --> 49:19.080
You would have no problem recognizing your liver as extremely intelligent,

49:19.160 --> 49:22.600
because it would be solving all these problems on a daily basis and you would know, you would feel

49:22.600 --> 49:26.920
it. I mean, the same way that we see, oh, look, that crow in that octopus, look at the amazing

49:26.920 --> 49:31.560
things they're doing. You would see your liver doing that stuff every day if you had the perception

49:31.560 --> 49:36.680
of this other space. And we can build things, right? So at some point, we'll talk about synthetic

49:36.680 --> 49:42.760
beings and we can build things that will have consciousness in those spaces. But so I end up

49:42.760 --> 49:49.960
exactly where Don ends up. I think that we are these nested hierarchies of consciousness. This is

49:49.960 --> 49:55.560
only some of them are verbal. Only some of them do we have any direct connection to, but they're

49:55.560 --> 49:59.960
all over the place and we're bad at recognizing them and that's why we need to, you know, we need

49:59.960 --> 50:09.960
to think about these things more. Don? Brilliant. That's brilliant, Mike. And I agree. I'm definitely

50:09.960 --> 50:15.320
not the biologist that Mike is, but I'll just throw in another simple biology example to support

50:15.320 --> 50:22.120
what he's saying. And that is with split brain patients, right? So some people who have intractable

50:22.120 --> 50:29.800
epilepsy that can't be treated with normal drugs were in extreme cases where they were,

50:29.800 --> 50:36.760
their lives were on the line, submitted to a surgery called colosotomy surgery, where they would

50:37.720 --> 50:41.720
Joe Bogan, who was a friend of mine, would actually take a scalpel and go in there and cut the corpus

50:41.720 --> 50:47.400
colosum, which was a band of about 220 million fibers that connect the right and left hemispheres

50:47.400 --> 50:53.480
of the brain. And it was a success. If the epileptic focus was on the right hemisphere,

50:53.480 --> 50:59.320
you would spare the left hemisphere from getting bothered by an epileptic seizure. And so it was

50:59.320 --> 51:05.800
a clinical success. But then some other friends of mine and other researchers started to study,

51:06.440 --> 51:11.240
what's different about these people that have their brains cut in half? And Mike Zaniga and many

51:11.240 --> 51:18.760
others, but did this. But friend of mine, Ramacandra, V.S. Ramacandran at UC San Diego, friends called

51:18.760 --> 51:25.320
Rama. So what Rama did was he found one patient in which the right hemisphere, I believe,

51:26.360 --> 51:33.320
was an atheist and left hemisphere believed in God. So here, and another case was found in

51:33.320 --> 51:36.920
which the right hemisphere wanted to be a race car driver and the left hemisphere wanted to have a

51:36.920 --> 51:45.320
desk job. So you have, you know, those are as different a personality as you could possibly want

51:46.040 --> 51:51.880
stuck inside one cranium. And so that raises the question, here I am with my corpus colosum intact.

51:52.440 --> 51:59.000
And why is it that on Friday night, a battle going on about what I want? Maybe one part of me

51:59.000 --> 52:02.760
says, let's go out and have fun. The other part says, no, I got a book I want to read.

52:02.760 --> 52:07.560
Well, maybe there are two people in there. And they really want to do two different things on

52:07.560 --> 52:14.280
Friday night. And I do have to negotiate among them. And so who is the I now that is doing

52:14.280 --> 52:19.400
the negotiation among those two people? So the whole notion of a self then becomes really interesting

52:19.400 --> 52:28.680
and very problematic. So I agree completely with Mike on that. And again, a big issue here is

52:29.400 --> 52:37.720
we're only seeing things through a space time interface. Right. And so it's not like, for

52:37.720 --> 52:42.600
example, the distinction we make between living and non living, or conscious and unconscious

52:43.560 --> 52:49.640
is a principle distinction. Right. So just to get what I'm talking about here, I'm looking at

52:50.440 --> 52:56.120
all of you on a zoom screen. So I'm looking at Mike right now on the zoom screen. And some of the

52:56.120 --> 53:03.080
pixels are pixels for Mike's face. And when I look at those pixels, I'm getting a portal into

53:03.080 --> 53:06.520
Mike's consciousness. I can tell if he's interested, I can tell if he's bored, I can tell

53:07.320 --> 53:11.560
I get some insight into his consciousness. But there are other pixels of a floor, for example,

53:11.560 --> 53:17.320
in the back of this chair. And those pixels are not giving me any insight about consciousness.

53:17.320 --> 53:22.440
Now, should I say that some pixels are conscious? And other pixels on my zoom screen are not

53:22.440 --> 53:27.960
conscious. That's stupid. Pixels are pixels. They're not conscious or unconscious. Some of

53:27.960 --> 53:33.800
them are giving me a portal into Mike's consciousness and others are not. So it's not so the same thing

53:33.800 --> 53:39.160
is true of space and time and what we call physical objects. There is the distinction we make between

53:39.160 --> 53:43.640
Oh, that's alive. And that's dead or that's conscious. And that's not conscious is the same

53:43.640 --> 53:47.720
mistake as saying, Oh, those are those are conscious pixels. And those are unconscious pixels on my

53:47.720 --> 53:52.840
zoom screen. It's exactly the same mistake. An interface is just an interface. It's not the

53:52.840 --> 53:59.000
truth. So, so it's not a principal distinction between living and non living. It's an artifact

53:59.000 --> 54:06.680
of the limitations of our interface that we're mistaking for insight into the nature of reality.

54:06.680 --> 54:12.440
It's a rookie mistake. So we have to get past the rookie mistake of saying that the distinctions

54:12.440 --> 54:16.760
that we see in our interface are therefore necessarily true in reality.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.720
Sorry, I just want to add one one funny. Well, I don't know if it's funny, but a story of a kind

54:23.720 --> 54:29.480
of a troubling story that that goes with Don's point about having two different opinions in

54:29.480 --> 54:36.840
your in your brain. And so I read this. This was a description of a therapist as a psychiatrist

54:36.840 --> 54:41.480
to have this experience. So, so this guy this patient comes in and he says, I've got some sort

54:41.480 --> 54:47.080
of dissociative disorder where I've got there's a personality in there that he's a real partier

54:47.080 --> 54:50.440
and and I like to work and and he just started, you know, I can't I can't work anymore because

54:50.440 --> 54:54.200
sometimes he comes out and screws up, you know, he acts, you know, acts like a fool at work and

54:54.200 --> 54:57.960
whatever we need to take care of this. And so, you know, they start doing some sort of I don't

54:57.960 --> 55:02.840
even know how they do it, but some sort of integrative therapy and so so one day one day

55:02.840 --> 55:07.080
the patient walks in and it's the other guy. And he says, Hey, what's this I hear about

55:07.080 --> 55:12.120
integrating integrate? What are you guys doing? And the doctor says, Well, you know, we're going

55:12.120 --> 55:18.920
to integrate you. And he says, Excuse me, you're going to integrate me and who's going to be left?

55:18.920 --> 55:22.840
He says, Well, you know, you'll be well, you'll do well at work. Wait a minute,

55:22.840 --> 55:27.000
wait a minute, where am I going to be? And he's and the doctor said, Well, you're kind of going

55:27.000 --> 55:32.920
to be gone. I hope if you know, if we do, are you kidding? What? What happened to the hypocriticals?

55:32.920 --> 55:37.480
What do you mean? I'm going to be gone. I don't want to be gone. You know, he's a boring, you

55:37.480 --> 55:44.200
know, he's boring. I've got the fun life to make him gone. And so and right. So just put yourself

55:44.200 --> 55:49.560
in that in that place, right? I mean, presumably the other, you know, the other personality signs

55:49.560 --> 55:54.520
the checks and everything. But but but but you're faced with a coherent. This isn't some weird tick

55:54.520 --> 55:59.640
or reflex. This is a coherent being that is making an argument that knows what what a

55:59.640 --> 56:04.120
hypocritical it is and is making an argument that whatever that whatever you're doing is going

56:04.120 --> 56:09.960
to erase them from the world by sort of somehow jamming you down into this into this integrated

56:09.960 --> 56:16.040
personality that can spend, you know, 12 hours at work and not have any fun. So that's, I mean,

56:16.040 --> 56:21.720
that's a super, you know, it's a super disturbing sort of kind of, you know, way to think about this

56:21.720 --> 56:29.080
because we there are no as far as I know, there are no indivisible beings. We are all made of

56:29.080 --> 56:35.240
parts that that's just how it has to be. And therefore, there is the possibility of that,

56:35.240 --> 56:41.560
that magical, which I think if anything is magical, this is it, it's this this this process by which

56:41.560 --> 56:48.840
by which merge into a larger scale, collective, you know, self or individual, that that process

56:48.840 --> 56:52.680
is going to have failure modes, some of them temporary, some of them permanent. And and it's

56:52.680 --> 56:57.320
these failure modes that really give us something to think about in terms of what are we and who

56:57.320 --> 57:05.320
are we and how we relate to each other. Fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, we recently have McGiocchus. Ian

57:05.320 --> 57:11.960
McGiocchus came to our club last Monday. Yeah, he has booked the matter with things. Yeah, he talked

57:11.960 --> 57:19.160
about the the laugh and right hemisphere hypothesis a lot in his book on his volume one. Yeah, we're

57:19.160 --> 57:27.080
going to quickly move on before because Mike got to go pretty soon, probably about 30 minutes

57:27.160 --> 57:32.360
time. But but don't you can stay with us for another hours, right? So that I'm going to go

57:32.360 --> 57:39.560
straight to the the last question. So these conscious agents, the common factor done. So all

57:39.560 --> 57:47.080
these multi multiplicity and diversity of conscious agents. So how many of them so they're all going

57:47.080 --> 57:54.040
towards one field of consciousness. Is that what it is? And you speak on that, right? So

57:54.760 --> 58:01.160
so there's it's quite interesting. Suppose I start off with a countable infinity of conscious

58:01.160 --> 58:07.080
agents. So there's agent one, two, three, four, all the way to the countable infinity, then any

58:07.080 --> 58:13.160
combination of any subset of them. So agent one and two, agent one, two and three, whatever, that

58:13.160 --> 58:19.160
also is a conscious agent. That's a theorem of the math that any collection of conscious agents is

58:19.160 --> 58:23.640
also a conscious agent. So that means that I started off with a countable infinity of

58:23.640 --> 58:28.600
conscious agents. I can take the power set with what the mathematicians call the power set.

58:28.600 --> 58:33.400
That's the number of new conscious agents that come from combination. Well, that's a higher

58:33.400 --> 58:41.000
level of infinity. That's, you know, a left one. And now with that new set of agents, I can take

58:41.000 --> 58:48.360
their power set. Now I'm at a left to consciously. So now I'm marching my way up Cantor's hierarchy

58:48.440 --> 58:55.000
of infinities, and there's no end to that hierarchy of infinities. So so it's a it's a theorem that

58:55.000 --> 59:02.120
there is just one. And it's also a fact that I'll never be able to get there, which is again,

59:02.120 --> 59:07.640
again, also in line with the spiritual traditions, right, that they they say that anything that we

59:07.640 --> 59:13.640
can say about it, like the Buddhists will say, a finger pointing to the moon is not the moon,

59:13.640 --> 59:18.680
is just a finger pointing. And so that will be true of our scientific descriptions as well. We

59:18.680 --> 59:26.760
have to recognize that the scientific distractions are scientific theories are merely

59:28.040 --> 59:33.480
pointers, and they're not the reality. And in this case, what's what's nice about the scientific

59:33.480 --> 59:40.200
pointers is that they tell you that they're not the reality, they tell you that they are limited.

59:40.200 --> 59:45.640
And that's what's beautiful about the scientific pointers, like Einstein series space time. And

59:45.640 --> 59:51.960
with quantum field theory tells us that that pointer that space time idea fails at 10 to the

59:51.960 --> 59:57.640
minus 33 centimeters, that's where the pointer stops, and the moon begins, right, whatever's

59:57.640 --> 01:00:04.360
beyond begins. And so, so the conscious agent theory has the same nice property. It says,

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:10.520
basically, there is one conscious agent. And I can't describe it, I can, I can go to a left

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.880
zero, I can go maybe to go to a left one. Of course, even then I'll fail because I don't have a

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.120
super computer that can do it. So and I don't have enough paper to do it. So already you can see

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:26.040
that that is telling you this is a pointer and the reality is going to transcend the pointer

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:34.120
completely. Absolutely. Mike, did you agree in that night? They're all pointed to one or you're

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:44.840
still keen on your panpsychism? I think, I think both. I think they're not mutually exclusive.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:55.720
I think that there are, I mean, to me, recognizing agency and consciousness in the world around

01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:03.000
you is a lens that you bring to the process like any other. And so if you if you have a way of

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:11.240
recognizing intelligence in components of something that's great, and then you may have, you may also

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.840
observe that the whole thing is so so so just to give an example, we recently, there's this there's

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.160
this mathematical notion of a gene regulatory network, it's very simple. It's a collection of

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:27.480
nodes, let's say a dozen of these nodes. And you're just going to write down how each one up or down

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.840
regulates some others. So it's this like little network. And you can, you know, people have been

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:36.440
like Stu Kaufman has been studying this for a long time. And you can you can view them as as

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:43.800
dynamical systems and see what they do and so on. So you look at this thing, and you say, well,

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.520
okay, it's very simple, I can see all the parts, there's nowhere to hide here. This is like the

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:55.000
rock bottom of deterministic, you know, zero agency mechanical system, there's just nothing there.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.960
So we took the hypothesis. So my view always is that you can't just make these pronouncements

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.400
from a from an armchair, you have to do experiments. So we said, okay, what if we just

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:09.320
what if what if we test the hypothesis that this thing has some degree of, of, of cognitive

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.040
of cognitive ability. So what we what we ended up doing was testing their learning capacity

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:19.320
in the following in the following way, we assign some one of the nodes as a condition stimulus,

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.920
another node as an unconditioned stimulus, and pick some other node as the read as the response.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:29.000
And then we do things like Pavlovian conditioning, we, you know, we twiddle two of them simultaneously

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
and we look at what happens. Anyway, you get the idea. So so we now have a couple of papers on this

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.120
that biological networks, and not so much random networks. So I think evolution likes this because

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.760
a biological networks do this more than random ones do biological networks show six different

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.720
kinds of learning, including associative conditioning in this in this dirt simple system.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.480
And that's with no, with no changing of the network structure. So we're not changing the

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.680
synaptic weights, we're not rearranging the networking, none of that. This is purely,

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.800
purely dynamical system stuff. But but but there is a lens. So there are two different two competing

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.360
lenses on the same phenomenon. One is the standard molecular biology lens. This thing is dumb as a

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.840
rock. And what you if you're going to change the way it works, let's say for biomedical purposes,

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.400
your only hope is bottom up rewiring, you need to add nodes, subtract nodes, you know, genomic

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.320
editing to change the way that these nodes interact with each other. That's your only hope. There's

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:23.240
another lens, which makes a completely different prediction. And if you which is that which is

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.720
that actually, if you treat if you don't rewire anything, but you treat this thing as a minimally

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:33.800
cognitive agent that that can be manipulated by experiences, by stimuli, by training, then you

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.960
can do some more stuff. And then you can look at these two lessons say, gee, this one tells us a

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.880
lot that we can use in biomedicine that we're actually not getting out of here. Right. So so

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.640
you can have multiple perspectives, they have different powers in terms of what they let you

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.920
do in the real world. Maybe someday somebody else will come along and say, ah, you're both wrong,

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.520
here's a much better lens, you know, fine, that's how it goes. So so then so then that that allows

01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.680
you to have it all, you can you look at a human body and you say, I'm looking really deep and I

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:06.200
see some components that clearly have their own thing going on. But of course, so does the organ

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:11.160
that they sit in and because because that has certain certain interesting capabilities in

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.320
physiological space. And then the whole thing that we're going to call a human, well, that's a

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.240
bigger intelligence that can do other things in behavioral space, maybe linguistic space.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:26.040
So I I see it both ways. I think I think the merging is is is correct. I think Don's totally

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.000
right about all of that. But I also think that there are useful lenses that allow you to exploit

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.800
a panpsychist view. And just to be clear, you know, the there's a couple of different versions

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.200
of panpsychism. The one where the one where you take a perfectly good physics and then paint some

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.600
hopes and dreams on all the electrons, that's not that's not the one, right? So people correctly

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.560
make fun of that one, because that's just not going to give you anything. There's a different,

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:53.640
however, research program, which which which Don and people like Chris Fields and Karl first and

01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:01.880
other people are doing, which is to reformulate physics from the the cognitive perspective.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.640
So it's not that we have a perfectly good physics. And now we're going to paint some extra junk on

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.640
it. No, it's that actually, what we have been taking as physics is a, I don't know what the

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.520
right word for it, but but it's a it's a it's an oversimplification and a not a really not not

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:20.840
the best lens. I mean, it's done well in many areas, but it's not the best lens. And you can

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:26.360
formulate a different lens, where things like active inference and some of these other extremely

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.360
general things, and I don't pretend to be any kind of expert on active inference. But but but I

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:35.720
understand the research program, it helps you understand inanimate things and interactions

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:40.840
between living things and non living things from the same with the same lens. And I think that's

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:46.280
super powerful. And so I think you can have a useful version of panpsychism, where you scale

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:50.040
down your cognitive expectations. It's not that the rocks have hopes and dreams like humans,

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.240
that's not the point. The point is that you can use the same tools, including, you know,

01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.440
active inference and some and trainability and some other things to understand both physical

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:06.040
processes and then eventually, you know, advanced cognitive properties, maybe social phenomena,

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.360
who knows? Yeah, anyway, so that's a long answer to your question.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.280
Thank you. So how many conversations then to make a photon down? That's a question from the audience.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.000
Ah, so

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:27.960
that's what we're going to be working on on our very next paper. We're calling it

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.560
tentatively titled traces of consciousness paper. And the idea is that I was talking about these

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:42.120
trace chains, right? You've got a big, dynamical system of consciousness agent, a big agent,

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.480
but I can look at the two to the n sub agents and do a trace chain on each one of those.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:54.520
And I can change the temporal window. And so I should say just a little bit of background about

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.920
what motivates what I'm about to tell you. So in the paper that we just published last week,

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:07.640
we proved that the Markov chains map on two decorated permutations. I mentioned that earlier.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.840
Decorated permutations and the decorated permutations the physicists have shown

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:17.720
are the deepest structure they found behind space time. And with decorated permutations, you can

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:23.960
then create things like the amplitohedron and compute scattering amplitudes like two gluons

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:29.400
smashing into each other and four gluons go spraying out. So you actually, you can compute

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.080
all of the scattering amplitudes. Truly, if you just have these decorated permutations and maybe

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:43.480
momentum and spin data as well. And so when we made this mapping from our Markov dynamics onto

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.520
decorated permutations and decorated permutations into space time, that gave us the clue there's a

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:55.160
particular aspect of our dynamics of conscious agents that's critical for the physics and the

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:00.680
mapping of the physics. And it's called the communicating classes. So that's the key thing.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.400
They're so called. So if you look at Markov chains online, you can see what the communicating

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:12.680
classes are. It's a standard part of Markov chains. So our hypothesis, the one that I'm working on

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:18.600
right now is that the so-called entropy rate, this is the technical term in Markov chains. So if

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:26.680
you look it up online as well, entropy rate of a communicating class is what corresponds to mass

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:34.600
in space time. Okay. So particles in space time are projections of communicating classes, but

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.680
most communicating classes project to things far more interesting than particles. But particles are

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:44.120
projections of communicating classes. And for those communicating classes that project to particles,

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:50.360
it's the entropy rate that is their mass. So when you look at what I technically what I just said,

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:56.600
it means that if the Markovian dynamics, if the Markov kernel has only zeros and ones

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:04.440
in the matrix, then it will project to a massless particle like a photon. So now I'm getting to

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:11.480
your question about photons. You can see why I had to spend some time, right? The zero entropy rate

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:18.520
communicating classes project to massless particles, or I should say mass lift particle, the better

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.640
way to say this, massless particles are the projection of zero communicating, zero entry rate

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:27.720
communicating classes, because communicating classes don't necessarily project to particles,

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:32.120
they can project to more interesting things than particles. Particles are the simplest. So

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.760
that means, so now we want to find out exactly what specific, there are lots of different

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:44.360
kinds of Markovian kernels that are that have zero entropy rate. Some of them are, for example,

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:49.720
are derangements. They're permutations called derangements, and there are other kinds that

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:58.120
will have combinations of derangements, as well as absorbing states. So we want to look at those

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.800
and then figure out, okay, which correspond to like photons, but photons are not the only kind

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.400
of bosons. There is also gluons, there are W particles and Z particles, and then there's a

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:17.880
Higgs. So there's a number of massless particles, and so we'll want to get this dictionary between

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:25.000
the particular kinds of permutation matrices and which ones mapped to which with massless

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:31.400
particles. So that you can see that there's a lot of fun work ahead, but it's a deep technical

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.640
question. Looking forward to it, Lauren. So we're going to open up the floor for Q&A. We

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:45.240
are on the stage waiting to ask both of you some questions. So we're going to open it up now.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:55.080
We have Prakash. Yes, greetings. Fantastic talk, good conversation. I was just curious.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.080
You know, looking at living systems, I always wonder where would you put plants in this picture?

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:08.200
Plants are living agents. They don't seem to have neurons, but they have the same cellular space.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:13.160
I was just wondering what you would have to share about what do you think about plants?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:20.520
Who's the question to us? Prakash, is it to both?

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:27.080
Mike makes sense. Yeah, to break out the model.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:38.360
Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Mike, would you want to go first, Mike? Sure, sure. Well, I can do two

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.720
things. One is, so there certainly are people who study this question of plant intelligence.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.720
There have been some nice papers on that. People like Frantisek Balushka and some other folks

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.000
really talk about plant cognition and plant intelligence. From my perspective,

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.600
plants are not nearly weird enough as a challenging example for all of this kind of stuff. I mean,

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:10.040
and other people, of course, spend time thinking about really minimal models compared to which plants

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:17.560
are a no-brainer to pardon the pun for having cognitive capacities, including anticipation

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.160
and memory and learning and creative problem solving and various things. Plants do all of that.

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:30.200
So, yeah, I have zero. The fact that they don't have neurons means almost nothing to me. I think

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.080
as we think about the wide universe, I find it impossible to believe that the only things that

01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:41.800
have cognition are things with actual neurons like we have. I mean, that seems like just an

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:50.760
incredibly implausible view to me. And we came from, a lot of electrophysiology was done in

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.880
bacteria anyway. I mean, neurons, they do some interesting things, but this is way wider than

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:06.520
that. So, yeah, no problem with plants. I agree with Mike, and I think you said it well. So, yeah,

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:13.880
absolutely. Thank you. Are we going to move on to Andy? Hey, thank you both for being here.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.760
This is fascinating. Thank you, Ivy and John, for making this happen.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.080
It's hard to decide what to drill into. I would like to drill into this idea of the

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:33.400
simulations, the simulations that you claim prove that perception of truth leads to extinction.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.400
So, I want to drill in this idea of truth a little bit. What do you mean by truth versus

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:45.960
fitness? It seems like fitness is a sort of truth for a biological system. And can you give an

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:53.720
example of the perception, like a true perception of a thing leading to less fitness than a false

01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:00.920
perception and or a false perception of a thing leading to more fitness than a true perception

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:09.640
of a thing? And, you know, and finally, isn't the results say more about the simulation and how

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:15.320
it's built and the built-in approximations and assumptions and biases that are built into it,

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:24.840
then it says about reality. Thank you. That's a great question. So, I'll first just give you

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.400
as for an intuitive example that we might help understand why not knowing the truth could help

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:35.080
you out. I'll just give an intuitive example. In virtual reality, say, again, Grand Theft Auto,

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:40.040
you're trying to race against a bunch of friends, you know, you got your car and you're racing a

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:46.680
Porsche and the Maserati and so forth. And what are you really doing in reality in this metaphor?

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:51.080
What you're really doing to win the game is you're toggling millions of voltages per second

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:57.320
in a precise order. That's what you're doing to try to win the game. And that's in this metaphor,

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.080
that's the reality. What you're doing, what you know about what you're doing is you're turning

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.880
a steering wheel and you're pushing on a gas pedal. A lot, lot simpler than toggling a million

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:11.160
voltages per second in a precise order. So, now, if you said, well, yeah, I want to know the truth

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:14.040
and I'm going to try to play the game knowing the truth. I'm going to actually toggle the million

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:20.120
voltages per second to try to win. So, I can guarantee you the person who's trying to toggle

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:24.680
those voltages as fast as they can would lose against someone who is just turning a steering

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:30.120
wheel and pushing on the gas. And that's the top-level intuition why evolution hit the truth

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.880
from our eyes is because if you had to actually toggle all of reality, you would die in the

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.120
process. Better to give you just a user interface that hides most of that from you. So, that's the

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:50.840
intuition. But now for the math, we did simulations to begin with just to check to see what would

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:57.480
happen. And once we found that organisms that saw a reality word were going extinct, we then

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:01.560
let go of the simulations, we went to the math. So, I went to a mathematician. So, we now have

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:06.040
theorems. So, it's not, we're not relying on simulations at all. We have theorems. And the

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:11.640
theorems are using the tools of evolutionary game theory. And in evolutionary game theory, the key

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.880
technical notion are fitness payoff functions. The domain of that function includes whatever

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.520
objective reality might be. Evolutionary game theory doesn't tell you what objective reality is.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.880
It just says there is some objective reality. It could include organisms, their states, their

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:36.280
actions, and so forth. And then, so there's this fitness payoff that includes whatever objective

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.200
reality is in the domain of the function. And the range of the function are the possible payoff

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:46.200
values, say from 0 to 100. 0 means very, very bad. 100 means wonderful, wonderful payoff, say.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:55.960
And you can ask a clean technical question. What is the probability that a generically

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:05.800
chosen payoff function will be a homomorphism of some structure in the objective reality,

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:12.120
like a total order in objective reality or, you know, a measurable structure or topology

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.720
or whatever it might be? In other words, what is the probability that a fitness payoff function

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:24.360
will actually have information about structures in objective reality? Because if it doesn't have

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.640
information about the structures, how can it tune you to the structures in objective reality?

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:38.600
So we ask the technical question, do fitness payoff functions generically contain information

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:45.720
about structures in objective reality? And we, if you want to see the math, you can Google our

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:51.960
papers called Fact, Fiction, and Fitness. So that's the paper where we go through the math.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:57.160
And what, Chaitan is the mathematician, not Don Hoffman. Chaitan is the mathematician,

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:03.480
but of course we collaborate on it. And what we prove is that for several different structures,

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.080
but when you see the trend, you realize it's true basically for all structures,

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:14.680
the probability is zero, precisely zero, that a generically chosen payoff function

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.240
will have any information about objective reality, about any structure in objective

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:24.200
reality. So there's nothing in the fitness payoff functions to tune you to objective reality.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:31.240
Now, I'll just mention a couple quick objections that people see. One objection that

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:45.080
made in Sintes recently is, look, you're using evolutionary game theory. So either you believe

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:52.600
that evolution, the math of evolutionary game theory models biological evolution correctly,

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.760
or you don't believe it does. And if you do believe it models biological evolution correctly,

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:03.240
well, biological evolution assumes that there are physical objects like organisms in space and

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:11.480
time and resources. And if you don't believe that, so if you're going to use evolutionary

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:15.080
game theory to say that there are no such thing as physical objects in space, time is fundamental

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.960
reality, then that would be contradicted. You'd be contradicting yourself because the math,

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:25.960
you're claiming the math faithfully models the physical biology. And if you don't think the math

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.880
of evolutionary game theory models the physical biology, then you shouldn't use it anyway because

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.200
you didn't think it models. So either way, you're stuck in a logical contradiction. That's

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:42.280
sort of his argument. And what that argument misses is how science works. So take Einstein's

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:50.360
theory of spacetime and quantum field theory. So these theories assume their mathematical

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:55.320
theories are built on the assumption that spacetime is fundamental. So Einstein's special

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.960
relativity and quantum field theory, those mathematical, those assume that spacetime is

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:05.560
fundamental. So you could use the same argument. So, but notice what the physicists do is they

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.000
say our theories tell us that spacetime is doomed. Spacetime is not fundamental. Okay, well, okay,

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.960
so I'll use the same, got you logical argument. Well, so either Einstein's math modeled his

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:23.880
intuitions, in which case it could not possibly show that spacetime is doomed, or it didn't model

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:27.560
his intuitions, in which case you couldn't use it, you shouldn't use it to show that spacetime

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:32.280
was doomed. Well, no physicist would take that seriously. That's a, that's a silly argument.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.560
Here's what really goes on in science. Every scientific theory makes assumptions. And there

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.440
is no theory of everything. There is no such thing as a scientific theory of everything.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:51.320
So a good scientific theory starts with assumptions and basic concepts, but a good scientific

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:59.320
theory will tell you the limits of those concepts. Einstein's theory with quantum field theory tells us

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:05.640
the limits of his basic concepts, namely 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, and 10 to the minus 43

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:12.840
seconds, you fall apart. So what we're doing is exactly the same thing, but with evolutionary

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:19.720
theory, the assumptions about sure Darwin thought about physical objects in space and time. Absolutely.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:26.200
What are the limits of those concepts? Well, evolutionary game theory is the mathematics,

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.760
and that mathematics is precise enough to tell us the limits of the basic concepts, just like

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:39.320
Einstein's theory of relativity is good enough to tell us the limitations of Einstein's notion

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:45.800
of space and time, or spacetime. So this is the way science works. It's not a self refutation.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:52.600
To think that is actually to misunderstand fundamentally the nature of scientific progress.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:22:00.360
Now, what you can't do is to use the old theory to tell you what's next, right? So

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:06.040
Einstein's theory tells us spacetime is doomed, but it can't tell you where's the next step

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:11.320
beyond spacetime. It can't do that. And similarly, the theory of evolution by natural selection

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:17.240
with the mathematics of evolutionary game theory tells you, aha, the notions of organisms in

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:24.280
space and time is not fundamental. But does it tell you, okay, what is more fundamental? No,

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.760
it doesn't tell you what's more fundamental. So that's where the scientists have to make a creative

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.800
leap. And physicists have done this just in the last 10 years. They went outside spacetime,

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.520
they found the amplitude, Hedron, they found decorated permutations. That's a creative leap.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:43.080
But then what you do is you show how they project back into spacetime, right? You have to go back

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:47.880
and get your previous theories as a special case of the more general framework. And so we have to

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.760
do the same thing. Our theory of conscious agents is a leap beyond evolutionary theory.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:57.240
But we have to show how it projects back into space and time and gives us back evolutionary

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:04.120
theory as a special case. So I'm answering your question, but I also want to answer another question

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.800
that has just been published in Sintase, you know, the philosophy journal recently.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:18.200
And I just want to point out that that argument just falls flat very easily. I'll stop.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:27.080
Thank you. Can we move on? We have LeMond. LeMond, did you want to ask questions?

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:43.400
Hi, Donald. We've corresponded before. I think I'm probably one of your biggest fans on Clubhouse

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:49.320
here. I was wondering if you had had any correspondence with Neema Arkani-Hamed,

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:55.080
because I know that you're following what they're doing in high-energy physics really closely. And

01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.160
a lot of people have been, you know, begging Neema to, you know, write a book that's, you know,

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:06.280
more understandable for the general public, because I'm fascinated with the, you know,

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.280
decorated permutations and the amplitude hydrant. But it's so far over my head.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:15.720
Could you provide any resources on how to really get a grasp on what that means?

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:23.320
Right. So I would love to talk with Neema. I haven't yet. And I'm hoping to actually get

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:28.600
to a place where I'll be worth his time. So I'm trying to, you know, the work I'm doing on these

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.640
trace chains and so forth. The decorated permutations stuff and the mark of chains onto it, I think

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:37.640
already might be of interest to him. But I want to push this a little bit further. His time is very

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:42.520
valuable. When I talk to him, I'd like, if I get the chance to talk to him, I'd like to really have

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.920
something that'll be of interest to him. But if you want to see more details, a little bit more

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:55.640
accessible about the amplitude hydrant and the decorated permutations is, of course, at Harvard

01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:02.600
that he gave in the fall of 2019. So if you Google, Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One,

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:10.280
you will find on YouTube, they post it all 20 something 25, 20, whatever it is, lectures.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:15.720
So Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One, you'll see that he has an introductory lecture.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:21.960
And he really lays it out in the introductory lecture. He tries to be fairly non-technical.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.920
It's for a graduate class at Harvard. So, you know, non-technical for them might be technical for

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:33.640
the rest of us. But it's fairly accessible. And that's probably, I would say, his class and all

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:38.680
the lectures are online. That's maybe the most accessible source you're going to find right

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:45.960
now is his Harvard lectures. And I've studied, I've been studying his lectures. I've actually

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.960
transcribed 15 of them, all his first 15 lectures. I've transcribed myself personally,

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:58.680
equation by equation, figure by figure. I did that until COVID stopped me. COVID took me out.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.560
But I plan to get back to it now. I'm starting to recover from COVID and go back to it. But yeah,

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:09.720
I'm really trying to study Neema's stuff. And, you know, I'm not a physicist.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.000
I work with physicists. And at some point, we would love to talk with them.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:23.960
Thank you. And we move on to Willie. Wonderful. Thank you, Ivy. And thank you

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:30.680
to have this great minds in the same room and watching your conversions at some point.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:37.960
And I have two questions for each of you, one question. And it's definitely fascinating what

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:45.640
you are doing, God. And I say the first thing that great jumps in science are often company

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:52.440
of a big flock of people who don't understand what the new perspective is. So I'm also confused

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:58.680
sometimes by the combination of metaphors and mathematical apparatus and all this.

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:05.480
It's in the making, definitely. And I will take it for granted that you imply kind of

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:14.200
anti-realism with your stance. And I don't want to discuss it. What I want to see, if I get it right,

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:22.200
is that you are letting go reality and space time in a way. And starting with the fundamental of

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:30.120
conscious age. And we had a reading room here with these wonderful people from the

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:36.200
2014 article, The Origin of Time in Conscious Agents. And we found that it's a bit hard to

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:43.800
define or to go with you, what you mean. And it reminded me of the Floggy Stone story,

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.480
which is famous from Thomas Eskuhn about the structure of the revolution and Occup's razor

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:55.080
and so on. And we found out that we don't need Floggy Stone to understand that

01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:03.880
heat is flowing from a hot point to a cold point. And so we let go Floggy Stone.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:12.280
And I wonder how it can be in the same way let go reality and space time. Does it really make

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:20.200
sense? What are the practical and theoretical consequences in science and in life? And closing

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:27.240
here for your question, the old Leibniz introduced Monats in the same way as atomism just cannot

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:35.720
deliver the mantle. This was his basic intuition. It cannot deliver a series of emergence or

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:43.320
combination or composition just doesn't suffice to make us understand how this should ever work.

01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:51.080
So I understand to go back to the primacy of the mild, definitely. But what are the predictions?

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.360
Is it detectable? Are you working on a kind of

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:01.800
operationable and kind of a detector, so to speak, that you can say now we can

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:08.680
here really see that here's a conscious agent. Sorry, it's in space time somehow,

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:15.080
but we can detect it and then we can count it just as an example. And then we can even see

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:21.240
how they emerge together or cooperate together and let time emerge. Something like this would be

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:27.560
very ambitious, of course. And should I go to Michael or should I just wait for you?

01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:33.640
We really got to Michael first, because Michael got to live in time and it's time to

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:44.120
sort of succinctly ask your questions. So for me, also you, contrary to what Descartes was doing,

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:51.240
Descartes tortured cats saying that they are not sentient beings, they are just machines,

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:57.240
don't worry. And now we have inflation of consciousness and inflation of conscious

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:03.160
ancients, contrary, for instance, to even Thompson, who is preferring biopsychism,

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:10.840
psychism to panpsychism, only biological stuff like maybe even plants might have consciousness.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:18.200
And now my question is, because you are also coming from a series of process structure like

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:24.760
autopoiesis in a way, but I guess you're going in a different direction. You're going into this

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:32.040
bioelectricity pattern. Here's my question. Are you looking for a substrate where the

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:39.000
self then is emergent? Because you're using the term emergent and have a different,

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:47.960
you have a different ontology, contrary to Don, because you are starting quite with common sense

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:53.960
that you are observing nature like Aristotle, Newton, Gallier, and so on. And then from this on,

01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:01.640
you are constructing theories. And yeah, you say, I start with reality in a way, or do I get you

01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.640
wrong? And the last thing, and this is again, to both of you, are you actually waiting for a new

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:17.160
physics, which might be even produced by Donald? Yeah, this is very exciting, because maybe this

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:23.800
comes together. So thank you for both of you for your answer. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm not

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:31.080
sure I will be able to hit all of that, but I'll try to get to some of it. The first thing I should

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:41.000
say is that I'm in an enjoyable position here, where on this panel, I'm not the most sort of

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:50.200
avant garde person here. So Don has gone further. My stuff is a little more mundane. I have not

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:56.520
really said anything about consciousness. I don't know anything about any new physics. I haven't

01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:01.320
really gone there, although I'm in complete agreement with Don's view of it and where he's

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:08.360
going with it. I have a somewhat less ambitious thing, which is that I'm interested in cognition.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:17.400
Cognition is not the same as consciousness. Cognition is, and I sort of get into this in

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:25.000
excruciating detail in this last tamed paper, what exactly I mean by cognition. But to address

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:33.640
your first point, I do think that there's way more of it, not less of it than, for example,

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:39.240
Descartes might have thought. I think it's actually extremely prevalent in the universe. I don't

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:45.320
think it is limited to things that we would call alive. I'm actually not sure what we mean by alive

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.720
necessarily, and I don't spend any time trying to figure out what this category is. Other people do,

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.960
and that's great. I spend all of my time thinking about cognition, not life, because I think there

01:32:53.960 --> 01:33:03.560
are many things that are importantly cognitive that we may or may not call life. So that's

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:09.400
and I have this, and B is that I have this functional framework, it's called TAME,

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:15.880
which is technological approach to mind everywhere, that basically it's a very engineering

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:22.600
kind of approach that seeks to show you what exactly are the practical benefits of

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.600
odd cognitive lens. So it's very important to me that this is not just philosophy, that this is

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:35.320
all of these views are supposed to drive new discoveries, new research programs, so half of

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.560
my lab takes this stuff and turns it into interventions for biomedicine, for cancer,

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.400
for whatever, because this is not just supposed to be, well, you can look at it this way, or you

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.840
can Occam's razor it and just sort of do the science. That's actually not true. This way of

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.920
thinking about this gives rise to new experiments and new capabilities that we didn't have before.

01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.280
And maybe at some point, consciousness will be folded into that. I haven't done that yet,

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:04.600
and so I make no claims whatsoever about consciousness yet. But I do think that

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:19.240
this view of basically dropping our teleophobia, we've developed through the early stages of

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:25.080
science this really weird fear of talking about goals and the systems that pursue goals.

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.080
And I think we need to dump that. I think that leaves so much on the table when we pretend that

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:36.440
doesn't exist. Since the 40s and cybernetics, we've had good theories of how you can have

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:41.960
non-magical goal pursuing systems. So I think it's time to kind of give up our fear of that.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:49.400
And once you do that, really interesting examples of novel research programs come to light.

01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:54.680
And bioelectricity, I think you mentioned bioelectricity. So bioelectricity happens to be

01:34:54.680 --> 01:35:01.640
my favorite kind of cognitive glue for cells into larger systems, but it is not the only one.

01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:05.560
I don't think it's magic. I don't think it's the only game in town. I'm sure there are other

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:10.840
mechanisms that play the same functional roles and who knows other places in the universe what

01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:17.640
substrates play that role. But here on earth, what evolution has done is really exploited

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:23.640
bioelectricity and shown us how you can use certain features of physics and computation

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:29.640
to scale up cognition from very primitive goals of homeostatic little tiny systems all the way

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.480
up through human level, massive cognitive light cones. So I love bioelectricity, but it is certainly

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:42.920
not the only game in town for that. Thank you, Michael. Can we give a massive thank you to

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:50.040
Professor Levin because Professor Levin would have to leave now. So a massive thank you to

01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:55.720
Professor Levin, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. Great to see you, Don.

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.760
Awesome to be able to discuss this. And thanks, everybody. Thank you for your questions.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:03.640
Great to see you, Mike. Thank you. See you soon. Thanks. Right. See you soon. Thank you.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:11.080
Thank you. So I'll respond to the question as well. So first, the notion of reality, I would

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:20.520
distinguish two kinds of reality. You might say something is real if it exists, even if no one

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:29.640
perceives it. That would be what you might call objective reality. But that wouldn't apply to

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:36.200
my headache. So suppose I have a headache. Well, that headache sure seems real to me, but it would

01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:41.720
not exist without someone perceiving it, right? So the notion of objective reality doesn't seem to

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.880
catch my headache. And if you told me my headache wasn't real, I'd be very crossed with you. I mean,

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:51.960
it's real to me. So I'll distinguish between objective reality versus subjective reality in

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.480
that sense. And then what I'm saying is that we thought that space, time, and physical objects

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:02.680
like the sun and the moon are objective reality. And all I'm saying is, no, they're a different

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:06.920
kind of reality. They're subjective reality. We thought that they were objective reality,

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:14.680
but no, they're subjective reality. And I think quantum theory, the Nobel Prize in physics last

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:21.480
month was awarded to three researchers who have done empirical work showing that local realism

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:27.720
is false. And basically, what I'm saying is local realism is false. These things are all

01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.560
subjectively real. They're there when you observe, those properties are there when you observe,

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:35.400
and they're not there when you don't observe. They're subjectively real, but not objectively

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:41.880
real. So now in terms of lightness, yeah, lightness, brilliant work in monodology,

01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:47.880
and, you know, he had the analogy of the mill where he understood the hard problem of consciousness

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:52.120
and dismissed it in one paragraph. He knew that you couldn't boot up consciousness from

01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:56.360
physical systems. And it was so obvious to him he didn't think it was worth more than one paragraph

01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:04.040
of his time to spend on it. And I agree. And so he then proposes the monodology and the

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:12.040
monads. And he basically says we need to start with two things, experiences and probabilistic

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:18.920
relationships among experiences. And I agree with lightness again. That's what we've done in our

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:23.320
model of consciousness. We basically model experiences and probabilistic relationships

01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:31.720
among experiences. So lightness was there 300 years before me. And his notion of pre-established

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:38.280
harmony, that I think we're going to be able to model that in the way I was talking about earlier,

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:43.880
where I have like a big Markovian kernel for a big conscious agent. And when I take its trace

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:49.480
chain, there's two to the n trace chains, those are two to the n conscious agents that are all

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:53.480
interacting. It'll look like a pre-established harmony because they're all part from this one

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:57.240
big, now I can't do the trace chain on the one big conscious agent, the ultimate one. I can't do

01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:04.040
that just because, well, Apple hasn't built a big enough laptop for me yet. But so you need to

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:09.960
you know, go to all of Cantor's hierarchy infinity. So Apple has a little bit of work to do ahead

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:15.400
for that. So we can't do that. But I sort of concede the notion of pre-established harmony

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:21.320
coming out of this. But it's also very useful for me to talk about conscious agents interacting in

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.920
non-trivial ways as independent agents looking at their interactions. So I mean, ultimately I think

01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:33.000
lightness is right, but I think this other perspective is useful, given that we can't

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.240
actually model the one itself. And finally, in terms of what kinds of testable predictions,

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:47.960
that's what I'm working on this year. I want to, I'll be writing a paper in

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:55.160
in terms where we try to show that we can predict precise part-on distributions

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:03.080
for protons from a theory of conscious agents. So the proton, as everybody knows, is one of the

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:08.760
fundamental parts of the nucleus of protons and neutrons, the nucleus of atoms. The proton itself

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:15.960
is one of the most complicated things humankind has ever studied. It's not a trivial little ball,

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.960
and it's not just three quarks. You see three quarks, two up quarks and a down quark,

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:27.480
at sort of low spatial resolution, Bjork and X and low temporal resolution, Q squared. But as you

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:31.960
increase your spatial and temporal resolution, you find at the highest resolutions, you see

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:38.120
what they call a gluon C, an ocean of gluons that are appearing and disappearing. And then

01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:46.680
as you back off, and you sort of have larger temporal scales, less temporal resolution,

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:52.760
then you start seeing quark, anti-quark appear or disappear. So you get this quark C, and then

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:59.160
finally at the crudest scale, you see the three quarks, and then some other quarks that are

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:05.560
appearing and disappearing. So they have momentum distributions for all Bjork and X and all Q

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:13.880
squareds. And I want to show that we can get all of those as artifacts of the spatial and temporal

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:20.680
windows of our trace chain. In other words, these particles and their properties that we're seeing

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:26.120
at the colliders are not an insight into a fundamental reality. All of the particles and

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:32.200
all of their properties are artifacts of the spatial and temporal resolution of trips by

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:39.080
conscious agents in their observations. So again, I could be wrong, but you're asking for a

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:45.240
prediction. So the thing about predictions is you can be wrong. So this is the prediction

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:52.440
that we're going to try to make, and we'll see where it goes. Thank you, Don. Maron, next. Great,

01:41:52.440 --> 01:42:02.760
thank you. Thank you very much. Good to see you, Professor Hoffman. I have a question about the

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:09.800
problem of perception. So under the free energy principle, perception has been defined as

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:17.720
finding the most likely explanation or the most likely value for a hidden variable, given the

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:25.000
current observations that, say, we have five sensory inputs, and at time t, we are receiving

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:33.080
five different sensory inputs through those five channels. And given that, I'd like to

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:40.520
predict the most likely explanation for a hidden variable that has probably caused

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:49.640
those sensory inputs. Especially in artificial intelligence, when we want to create smart AI

01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:57.000
models, particularly deep learning models, we are talking about a hierarchical structure of layered

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:05.080
neurons. And one of the reasons that we do that, which is also similar to what they do in predictive

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:13.560
coding networks, is that we are having a hierarchical structure of neurons so that we might be able to

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:23.960
infer the hierarchical sequence of, you know, links of causality behind, what is it, like in the

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:30.200
world out there that might have caused these sensory inputs, sort of model the hierarchical

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:35.080
structure of God knows how many hidden variables and the way they're connected to one another.

01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:43.960
Now, if, first of all, I'd like to know whether you agree with this, like, would this be the right

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.240
at least approach, in trying to understand the complicated hierarchical structure of

01:43:51.240 --> 01:44:01.240
hidden variables. And second of all, because, I mean, this way, it seems intractable to me to try

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:09.080
and sort of, you know, model, you know, potentially many, many, many such hierarchical

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.880
relationships to so that we could model the world around us because it's just too complicated.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.080
So these are my two questions. Thank you very much.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:22.520
Yeah, great, great question. So the idea of perception as Bayesian inference is, you know,

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:29.640
have a long history in the field. I've done some papers on that myself. There's a book called

01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:33.160
Perception as Bayesian inference. So if you there is actually a book called Perception as Bayesian

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:39.560
inference by edited by David Nill and Whitman Richards and Whitman Richards was my PhD advisor.

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:44.040
And I have a paper in that book. So I'm very interested. And that's a 1996 book. So it's

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:49.480
quite old now, but it's, I've been interested a long time in Bayesian inference models of

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:54.760
perception. And I think that they're quite powerful. Most of my colleagues who are doing that are

01:44:54.760 --> 01:45:00.120
assuming that space and time is fundamental reality and that we're, the Bayesian inference was,

01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:05.720
we're actually finding the true physical substrate behind our perceptions. And I think that that

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:11.160
whole thing is that that interpretation of Bayesian inference is mistaken. And if you go to the,

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:17.400
you know, predictive processing, predictive coding kind of thing and the work on Bayes Nets,

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:28.360
for example, and the implications there, what you see is the nodes inside a markup blanket

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:32.360
appear to be doing this kind of, you know, Bayesian estimation.

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:38.280
Whenever I say something that sounds like Siri, Siri on my phone starts,

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:44.040
anyway. So, but, but, but here's the key thing that, that, that we know about Bayes Nets.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:50.440
The, even though it looks like the nodes on the inside are doing some kind of Bayesian inference

01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:57.480
about the world states, we know that the states of the nodes on the inside and the states of the

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:04.600
nodes on the outside of the markup blanket are conditionally independent, given the state of

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:13.000
the markup blanket. That means the only thing that the nodes on the inside can never, can ever

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:20.360
know about the external world is the information on the markup blanket. So that whole framework tells

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:26.760
you that you're only seeing an interface. The markup blanket is your interface and you're not,

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:31.320
when you're doing this predictive processing, you're not predicting, you're not estimating the

01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:35.960
true state of the world. You're doing something on an interface and you're using only interface

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:41.320
variables. So you never see the truth and you're not estimating the truth. And it's just right

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.840
there in the actual, you know, the fact that a markup blanket is the set of nodes that makes the

01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:50.840
internal nodes and external nodes conditionally independent. That means you can't know anything

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:56.920
more about the external nodes, except what you see on your markup blanket. So, so it just really

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.680
highlights what I've said from Evolution of a Natural Selection and what the physicists are

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:07.720
telling us. Not fundamental. Evolution tells us it's just an interface and so does the markup

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:14.680
blanket. It tells you it's just an interface. So they all agree. Thank you very much. Thank you,

01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:22.760
Don. John, did you have any questions for Don? Thank you, Ivy. Yeah, I, the one thing I guess I,

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:34.920
as a physicist, I confess, I, the one part, I like, I love your Windows interface analogy,

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:43.560
you know, and I, and I think that's really powerful. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry, not doing,

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:51.880
but I feel like, I feel like I can't quite make the leap to, you know, my experience in the world.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:58.520
And so for instance, the things that I have trouble with is kind of extending that to the idea that

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:04.520
I can both see things and feel things and I can travel to those things that I see and touch them

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.640
and other people can too. And they have the same experience. And I don't know, maybe I'm,

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:17.080
I just feel like I'm missing something there. And I wonder if you have anything to help me over that.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:27.160
Sure. Sure. I think, I think the virtual reality metaphor is a big, big help here. So for people

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:34.120
who are playing multiplayer, so multiplayer VR games. So I'm, I'm playing with somebody in China

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:39.080
and, you know, in Germany and in Argentina, we're all playing Grand Theft Auto together.

01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:44.040
And we can all agree that, oh yeah, I, you know, Hoffman is racing against a red Porsche and the

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:49.560
red Porsche is, you know, is 20 meters ahead of Hoffman. And we all agree. So we have consensus.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.120
And, and, and they might be giving me advice. You say, you know, Hoffman, you do a hard left there,

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:59.160
there's a shortcut, you can beat him, something like that. So we have consensus and it looks like

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.000
there's this objective reality, but we know that there is no red Porsche anywhere. There's just

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.960
some supercomputer and we're toggling bits. So, so when the physicists like Nima or Connie Hamid

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:14.280
tell us that space time is doomed, right? That it's not fundamental reality. There, but they're

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:19.160
going beyond, they're saying, okay, there is a reality beyond space and time. And by the way,

01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:24.840
beyond quantum theory. And but, but they're saying that quantum theory itself is not fundamental.

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.760
So, so the new structures that they're finding, like the amplitude, there are no Hilbert spaces there.

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:41.000
But the apple to Heaton is this high dimensional geometric object with facets and faces and edges

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.840
and vertices. And it turns out that the properties of space time and quantum theory, locality and

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:54.840
uniterity are coded in the face structure of these geometric objects beyond space time. So, so, so

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.000
this is so the physicists themselves, and this is only in the last 10 years. So most, by the way,

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:05.880
I was at a conference on consciousness, just a couple months ago, where a number of physicists

01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.680
who are quantum theorists, so they're their PhDs in quantum theory. And they're looking at

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:15.080
consciousness. At the end of their talks, every one of them I asked, now, are you aware of these

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.560
structures beyond space time, the amplitude, hedron and the decorated permutations, and to a

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:26.040
person, they had never heard of it. Now, now, now, the reason is, is this is high energy physics,

01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:32.120
right? Only people who are in high energy physics, right, know about this stuff. And, you know, so

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.280
why does a cognitive scientist know about it? Well, because I knew I needed to look for something

01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.000
beyond space time. So I've been looking for physics beyond space time. And when I found Nima,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.600
Arkanian, and their work, I realized, okay, okay, the other ones that would be doing it, they're

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:50.200
the ones that are pushing the envelope with the highest energies, right? They're the ones

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:56.920
that are going there. So it's, and it's Nima who's saying quantum theory is doomed, not just

01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:02.200
space time, but quantum theory, that both of those are going to arise together. Because if you think

01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:08.200
about it, the particles, right, some people are trying to boot up space time from like entanglement

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:13.720
of particles, right? But what are particles? Particles are irreducible representations of the

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:19.160
Poincare group of the symmetries of space time. So you're not getting outside of space time,

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:25.080
you're just staying in. So, so quantum theory does not get you behind space time. In fact,

01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:29.080
all the weirdness of quantum theory, the fact you need superpositions and collapse and all this

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:36.680
stuff is a symptom of an interface. It's the fact that you've lost information in projection.

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:41.080
That's why we get the weirdness of quantum theory and the no cloning theorem and all that stuff

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:47.320
is all an artifact of space time not being fundamental. And there's this deeper reality.

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:52.440
So now where physics is right now is, so the amplitude hydrant, so here's something for a

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:59.240
physicist. If you do the scattering amplitude computation, say for two gluons smashing into

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:03.800
each other, four gluons spraying out, you do it in space time using quantum field theory.

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:10.280
There's hundreds of pages of algebra, nasty, nasty math. If you do it with the amplitude hydrant,

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:16.600
three or four terms, you can compute it by hand. The math becomes trivial. Well,

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:24.200
relatively trivial. It's all relative. But trivial compared to what you have to do with

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:30.360
Feynman diagrams. And the other kicker is, you see new symmetries. There's something called the

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:35.720
infinite Yangian symmetry that's true of the scattering, but you cannot see it in space time.

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:40.600
You can only see it when you go beyond space time. So when the physics, when the physicists

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:44.520
find that the math is getting simpler and you're seeing new symmetries, bye-bye space time.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.400
Well, I'll be sorry to see it go.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.680
Well, it's a wonderful headset. It's been a useful headset.

01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:00.200
Thank you. Do you want to, do you know it?

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:07.480
Yeah, very quickly, Donald, you didn't talk about the hard problems, consciousness. It seems to me,

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:12.280
in fact, that that problem still remains as a problem because you essentially created a

01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:17.880
mathematical model of, you know, the effects of consciousness, not the consciousness, but the

01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:23.320
effects of consciousness, where the sentience, the sentience is coming into play in probably all

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:28.680
the way you're kind of portraying the reality. Can you just very quickly tell us something about

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:34.440
this? Because I feel that experience is something that you cannot, you cannot convert it into any

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:40.840
kind of model. That is my view. Right, right. So the hard problem is that it comes up if you,

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.960
if you assume the space and time are fundamental and you're trying to figure out how, for example,

01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:49.640
something like neural activity could cause conscious experiences. And there, I've got many

01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:54.200
friends and colleagues who are working in that direction and they're brilliant, but it's impossible

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:59.560
to solve that problem. And the failure is clear. There's, you know, there's, for example, integrated

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:03.080
information theory. What is the integrated information that must be the taste of chocolate

01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:07.960
or the smell of garlic? There's not a single one that they can do. Same thing with the orchestrated

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:12.360
collapse of microtubules. There's not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:17.000
And I predict I'd bet good money that they'll never be able to do it because it's just impossible.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.560
Lightness was right. It's impossible. So, so for me, I don't have the hard problem of consciousness

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:28.040
because I'm not trying to boot up consciousness from non-conscious ingredients. I'm saying that

01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:32.760
that whole approach is wrong. So I've got the reverse hard problem. I have to, I have to show,

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.240
if I start with consciousness, so I'm assuming consciousness, I have to show you how I give

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:43.160
you physics in all detail. So I'm doing the reverse hard problem. And that's why I said my goal this

01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:49.320
year is to predict the parton distributions for all the quarks and gluons and so forth inside the

01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:54.200
proton. In other words, that's my reverse hard problem. So I agree that we need to solve it,

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:58.840
but I have to go in the other direction. That one, I think, is feasible. And by the way,

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:06.600
my current simulations are already very, very, they're, they're encouraging. At small temporal

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:14.760
scales, I get a gluon C, a massless particle C appearing. And as I increase the temporal scales,

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:21.640
I get a C of small, increase the temporal scale even more, I start getting bigger particles with

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:28.280
greater math. So I get the, I've already in my simulations got the big picture now. But my goal

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.920
is not just the big picture. I want to get the exact momentum distributions. But already, my,

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:39.000
my current simulations tell me, you know, this is in a very profitable direction.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:45.000
Thank you, Dan. Can we move on to Ethan Prillock?

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:46.120
Yeah.

01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:47.880
Go straight to your question, please.

01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:53.240
Yeah, well, we had asked it about Delbrook earlier. And I'm just curious about comments as to how

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:57.080
you have additions or subtractions or how similar it is. Thank you.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:01.880
Well, just briefly, I mean, Delbrook did a lot of things. So what specific idea about Delbrook's

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:02.840
did you want me to comment on?

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:09.080
Yeah, I mean, he talked about evolution, not really providing for something that we should

01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:15.160
expect to understand, you know, the fitness function as modeling, real underlying reality.

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:21.640
So, so I'm not familiar with that. So he actually said that, that the notion of a fitness function,

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:24.520
the fitness payoff function is not a useful tool, you're saying?

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:29.000
He said it wouldn't really, we shouldn't expect it because of the way evolution works,

01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:34.520
to represent the underlying reality. But he didn't, you know, he didn't talk about it in terms of,

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:38.360
you know, operating systems, of course, we didn't really have any of the potentials.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:41.960
Oh, I see. So you're saying that he was sort of agreeing with me that he was saying that

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.920
we shouldn't expect evolutionary grounds that we don't see reality as it is. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:47.640
Absolutely.

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.800
And he was a student also of some of the great modern, he was a doctoral student of

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.720
you, one or two of the great modern physicists before he became a biologist.

01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.760
Right. So, so yeah, and I think he was not a reductionist, and I'm not a reductionist either.

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:07.240
So, so I, so I'll just say, yes, I agree with Delbroque on that. And he is absolutely my superior

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:14.040
in terms of his knowledge of molecular biology. And then my other one quick question too is,

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.120
in terms of the stuff that you were talking about these formalisms, is there anything that would,

01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:23.560
if we stay on the side of the Planck limits, that would make a demarcation about describing

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:28.280
features of the universe in, you know, a prebiotic situation or a proto-ecology?

01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:31.960
And is there anything that would show something like that?

01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:40.440
Well, what I think is going to happen from the simulations I'm doing is that as I

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:45.080
increase the windows, the spatial and temporal windows of the trace chains that I,

01:57:45.080 --> 01:57:50.680
that I do, I will get more and more complicated behaviors. And so I'm doing particles

01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:54.120
because that's the most trivial thing. I mean, I'm doing the physics is,

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:58.200
it's going to be the easiest thing. And it's also where we have the most data, right? The

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:01.880
physicists have been doing these scattering experiments for decades. And so we have tons

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:07.320
of data. And so I'm not going after the physics because I think that that's the final thing or

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.240
the most important thing is, it's the thing that you can do first. And you can get,

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:15.400
but I eventually want to show how as we go to larger scales of these trace chains,

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:22.120
we will then be able to see like the emergence of cells and organisms and greater organization.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.760
But that's more complicated. If I went after that first, I wouldn't have anything to report.

01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:32.520
I need to do the physics where we actually have a shot at getting a concrete result.

01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:39.160
Thank you, Don. Can we move on to Tony, please quickly? Yeah, it's going to be Don's last question.

01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:47.560
Okay. Let me try to add something useful. How you relate physics or fundamental physics,

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:52.280
particle physics and consciousness. This part is still not clear to me.

01:58:53.080 --> 01:59:00.120
Okay. So, so the, we just published a paper last week that you can take a look at it. It's

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:06.120
called Fusions of Consciousness. So if you just Google my name, Donald Hoffman and fusions of

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:12.600
consciousness, it's available free online and you'll read how we make the connection. But what

01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:21.160
I'll say at the top level is what we show in that paper is that communication or communicating classes

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:30.760
of conscious agents correspond or what are being catalogued by decorated permutations.

01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:34.040
So the physicists found these decorated permutations beyond space time,

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.360
these decorated permutations account for most of the data about scattering in space time.

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:43.560
So we said, okay, if, if decorated permutations are the deepest thing the physicists have found

01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:47.240
beyond space time, let's take our theory of consciousness and project it onto decorated

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:53.800
permutations. And we did. So that's, so we introduced new mathematics, the mathematics that

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:58.440
takes Markov chains and maps them to decorated permutations is brand new in our paper. So that's

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:03.400
a new contribution as far as I can tell to mathematics. And that tells us now that particles

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:10.360
in space time correspond to communicating classes of conscious agents. So that's, so that paper

02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:15.000
establishes that part in way we're clear in the paper, we're proposing that particles in space

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:22.360
time are projections of communicating classes of conscious agents. So in the next paper that

02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:29.400
we're working on, I'm going to we're planning to now make specific mapping. So for example,

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.240
what properties of communicating classes correspond to the mass of a particle? And there,

02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:40.040
I mentioned earlier, so my proposal, and this is not published, so I'm telling you what we're

02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:46.040
working on. And if you can beat me to it, go ahead and publish it. That'd be fine. I don't

02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:49.400
care who publishes, I just want to read the papers. I just want to know this stuff. So,

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:54.280
so I'm putting my ideas out there and someone who's a lot of people are smarter than me in

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:58.200
this area. So you can run with it and I'll be happy to read your paper. What we're proposing

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:08.840
is that the entropy rate of a communicating class corresponds to the mass. And the number of states

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:17.560
in the communicating class will will lead almost immediately or momentum and wavelengths. So,

02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.080
so those are the things that we're looking at right now, but we're going to write up, we're

02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:27.160
writing a paper, tentatively called traces of traces of consciousness, where we use these

02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:32.440
trace chains and show how particles arise as artifacts of the trace process. And all of their

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:38.520
properties arise like the they'll then be artifacts like the entropy rate of the Markovian kernel

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:43.080
that happened to arise as an artifact of the trace chain process, that will be the mass that you see.

02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:49.720
So, so that's how I'm proposing to get physics. All of the particles and all the properties

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.760
are not fundamental reality, they are artifacts of the way we observe.

02:01:57.160 --> 02:02:00.680
Statistical artifacts and we're going to, and that's not just a hand wave, we're going to say now

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:06.360
exactly what the statistics are and exactly how those properties emerge as the artifacts and why you

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:13.400
get like bosons first and then only later does it condense into fermions and so forth. That

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:20.840
that's all going to fall out of this, so. Thank you, Don. I have a very small question if I may.

02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:28.680
I will cry otherwise on stage. I'm sorry, Madej, we have to stop the interview now.

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:36.360
Don, have to go. So, can we all give a massive thank you to Don for today, for his time, please.

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:41.000
Don, thank you so much. It's been amazing. Thank you very much.

02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:47.240
Thank you, Don. Thank you so much. We'll see you later.

02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:52.200
Bye bye. Bye bye.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:11.800
you
