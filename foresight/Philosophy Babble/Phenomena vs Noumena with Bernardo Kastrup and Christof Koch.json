{"text": " Welcome back to the Great Minds series. This evening we are diving into the fascinating world of consciousness with two incredible guests. First up we have Professor Christoph Koch, Divisionary Chief Scientist and President at the Allen Institute of Brain Science. Christoph has been at the forefront of neuroscience, shaping our understanding of consciousness with his work on the Neural Basis and Development of Integrated Information Theory, or IIT. Joining him is Bernardo Castro, a dynamic philosopher and computer scientist who is shaking up the philosophy of mind with his passionate advocacy for analytic idealism. Bernardo challenges us to rethink everything we think we knew about a reality and consciousness. Together we are going to explore the intersections of neuroscience, physics and philosophy, and maybe just maybe we all will leave with a deeper understanding of our own mind. So welcome Professor Koch, welcome Bernardo. Let's dive in and get this conversation started. So Christoph, I'm curious about the recent shift in your perspective on consciousness. You have long champion, you know, integrated information theory, which places consciousness within a strictly physicalist framework. Yet it seems that, you know, that a personal experience has recently shifted you towards embracing Bernardo's analytic idealism. So would you consider this as a turning point in your ontological view? Thank you. Thank you, Ivy. Well, I mean, first of all, let's just take a step back. So we're talking about consciousness experience. IIT takes a position that what exists first, primary, for itself, absolute existence is consciousness. So that is not a classical physicalist position. When you see IIT is firmly within the physicalist framework, that's not really true. It's closer to, I would say, lightness. You know, first and foremost, what exists is my own, is my consciousness, the only thing I know about. I don't know about atoms and black holes and viruses and all of that, I have to infer. I don't know about dogs and all of that. All of that I have to infer based on my observations and inference and scientific methods. And so IIT starts with consciousness and then tries to characterize what is consciousness and what is the substrate of consciousness, like a brain or computer. That is very different from the majority of theories, almost all theories in neuroscience, that do start with a brain. So they say, well, let's look at the brain and what's critical for consciousness. And I used to be like that when almost a more than a third of a century ago, I started work with Francis Crick, the molecular biologist who turned into consciousness researcher. And we said, well, there might be these oscillations, you know, that neurons fire periodically with a period of 50 times or 40 times a second. So this was called 40 hertz oscillation. And even if that would be true, it's like, you have to say, well, why 40 hertz? Why not 30 hertz? Why not 50 hertz? Some people say consciousness has to do with broadcasting of information in a global workspace in the brain. Well, then you have to explain why is it that broadcast and there's any broadcast responsible. So all these theories try to take the brain and try to squeeze the brain by saying, well, it's this function of that neuron or this area or that neurotransmitter. So they try to squeeze the sort of the mixing metaphysics here, the wine of consciousness out of the brain. And that, as David Chalmers pointed out, is a very hard problem. So IIT starts differently. It says what first mode exists. The only thing I'm sure of that exists is consciousness. Not when I'm in deep sleep, because then I don't exist for myself. I'm gone. Not an anesthesia, because then also I don't exist for myself. So it's important to make this clear. IIT is not physicalist. It makes prediction about the substrate. It makes some very sense. The substrate in the brain for consciousness has to be a maximum of cause effect power. You can compute that actually. It's very explicit. If you know a mechanism, if you can describe the mechanism like the brain or any other mechanism using it mathematically, it's called its transition probability matrix, then you can unfold its causal power to see whether it's conscious and what it is conscious of and how conscious it is using this number called phi, which is the number between zero when it's not conscious and something positive. But it also says the physical stuff is subvenient in a sense it has a lesser existence. My brain exists for others. My body exists for others, but consciousness exists for itself. So that's the difference between absolute existence of mind and derivative secondary, if you want, relative existence of stuff like atoms and brains and cars and shoes and ceiling works for others. So you don't think that it's a physicalist model then? No, it's not. In fact, we were attacked last year as pseudoscience. There was this big Twitter storm in Letters Britain to Nature and other journals because people said, well, it doesn't take this physicalist position. It starts out with consciousness and we can't describe that. You have to start with something concrete like the brain. No, we want, of course, the project is to identify what other neural footprints in the brain, which bits and pieces of the brain are involved in generating anyone, in constituting anyone conscious experience, but ultimately what exists is consciousness. Now, it's not a classical idealist position because unlike analytic idealism, it does assume that there is some sort of substrate, some sort of undifferentiated substrate out there that could, you know, made out of atoms and elementary particles and maybe, you know, quarks or whatnot, just some stuff. But we humans impose everything else that we see. When I look at this room here, I see refrigerator, I see oars on the wall, I see wood, I can look out, I can see the sun. All of those are products of my conscious mind because there are no oars in a universe devoid of the mental. There is no refrigerator, there isn't even a sun. All there is is undifferentiated stuff, very simple physical stuff that can that can take different states. But but everything else is a construct of our minds. It's a construct of consciousness. Thank you. So what is the implication then when you have these changes? You went to see Bernardo two months ago to speak about these changes in your model. So you spoke about the crack. So what is the implications of the crack then we want to know? Well, so I guess again, we have to step a little bit backward here for the audience. So yeah, last year, I had a mystical experience sitting on a beach at midnight under the midnight moon in which myself was gone. There was no more self, there was no more Christoph, there was no body, there was no surround, there was all gone, there was no world. What I asked, what I accessed, what I experienced, it's very difficult, you know, it's sort of called ineffable for a reason. It felt closest, if you remember, if you've ever read Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, when he talks of a mind at large, you know, when he had this mescaline experience in Los Angeles in 1948, he he he experienced what he called mind at large. And that was my that was my experience, I experienced that that's something, well, there wasn't an eye when I say eye, I meant whatever remained of my conscious entity, because there wasn't a me explain something, there was no more border or distinction between object, subject, apprehender, apprehended, no annoying. But, you know, I used the shorthand for items to describe this mind, this conscious mind, apprehended, it felt like it apprehended something universal, cosmic, all-encompassing. And that really left me, I mean, that night completely perturbed, I was completely perturbed by this, and it's really left sort of like, like an earthquake, where you feel, you know, at my age, you know, I'm 67 now, at my age, typically your ontology is pretty well firmly established by now, right? You know, you believe what you believe in whatever world you believe, so it's uncommon for this to be to have this, just like in an earthquake, where suddenly you realize that the ground you stand on isn't what it seemed to have been for the last 50 years of my life. So, I'm still processing, I'm still working through that and how that's, how I can reconcile that with what I know about consciousness and what it means for me and this project, my life-flagging project is to identify the footprints of consciousness in the brain and to build tools to test for the presence of consciousness. And that's probably, and maybe here Bernardo can say something, even on idealism, I think that project remains intact, because what I've realized over the last several years, that physicalism is not science. I mean, physicalism is used to justify science, but you can still do all the science you do without necessarily being a physicalist, right? You can assume, accept as an external world, it has caused us that I can study, I can manipulate them, they're lawful, they're lawful regularities, right? I can discover them and then I can exploit them for technological, you know, using technology for societal benefit. So, all of that remains intact while you may just give up this belief that ultimately what truly exists is a physical. And there are two more reasons I began to doubt physicalism, pure physicalism over the last five or six years. One is that physicalism is utterly failed to explain consciousness. Typically, what it does as a late, you know, Dan Dennett, the American, the Dorian of American philosophers who passed away 10 days ago, essentially argued using very fancy words and languages that consciousness is an illusion. It doesn't exist. You can totally eliminate it from public discourse and nothing would be changed, because there isn't anything, you know, there isn't anything particular, special, it's not like a substance or spirit or anything like that. It's a complete illusion. If you think you're in pain, pain is all about the behavior disposition, the, you know, if you have toothpaste, well, you know, you rub your jaw, you don't eat on that side of your mouth, you moan about it, but there really isn't anything, you know, about qualia. He famously said in this interview qual, in, within New York Times, qualia humbug. That's all nonsense, okay? However, I've written to him about it. If you actually have toothpaste, you know, this God awful toothache, nothing will be taken away by telling me, well, it's just an illusion. It's still as bad as ever. And I still see the world and I still hear the world. And if it's an illusion, it's the most profound illusion that we have all the time as long as we are conscious. When we are unconscious, we don't have this illusion anymore. So I think calling an illusion is just a complete failure. It's a complete cop out. It's trying to cancel consciousness. And I think what's now clear that that attempt to cancel consciousness using sort of classical physicalism, physicalism has failed, okay? B, at the rock bottom, it's really difficult to describe what the physical is, right? It used to be easy, you know, when it was still last century or the century before it was called materialism, okay, it's atoms. And we all know what atoms are. They're these little billiard balls and you could shoot at them and they're positive negative charges. But now it's getting much more complicated, right? We still don't have a final theory of consciousness. And then we have all the paradoxes of quantum mechanics that you can have a so-called bell state where you have, you know, two, let's say two photons that have opted spin or two particles was opted spin, they can be a light year away. They can be trillions of kilometers away, but they're still mysteriously entangled. Such as if I look at one, immediately, the one, the other one that the other end of the universe, you know, is, you know, flips the opposite, you know, determines its state is the opposite. Well, that's not physical. I mean, that sort of really defies any idea of what physical is. So we don't know how to define really fundamentally the physical. We don't know how to deal with consciousness. And then I experienced something where I felt this was some sort of universal mental entity. And so here we are. Thank you. So, Bernardo, you think that IIT could complement your analytic idealism? So could you elaborate on that? Because we have a lot of guests want to know how do you going to combine these two? Yeah, can I just make a couple of initial observations? Because these are things I feel passionately about. One is the same mistake you made interpreting IIT as eminently physicalist I made years ago in a paragraph in your writing. I already apologized to Julio Christoff and everybody else for that, corrected that in print. So I understand your mistake and your mistake comes from the fact that there are physicalists who use IIT to justify their views in a kind of emergent framework. That doesn't mean that IIT itself or the people working hard to develop it binds themselves to the limitations of physicalism which they don't. Another thing that it's not the first time I hear after the video of the discussion between me and Christoff was published is that somehow Christoff changed his mind completely. Well, I didn't witness that. What I witnessed is a scientist has a netifice of work built behind him but he continues to explore. He continues to advance his understanding, to investigate more questions and to allow his understanding to evolve. This is eminently scientific. He's not flipping, he's not turning, he's not abandoning anything. At least I didn't see that. Christoff can answer this question. That's not what I witnessed. And so these two misunderstandings are going around and I think we should colorify these. Regarding IIT, Christoff explained that IIT starts from experience. It doesn't necessarily say that experience is the ontological primitive. These are metaphysical inferences and hypotheses. But IIT takes experience seriously as something that really exists and is not merely an illusion or some kind of epiphenomenon. It's a starting point and there is a substrate. Is that contradictory with idealism? No, in analytic idealism you have both things. You have experience and you have a substrate. What idealism does as a philosophy, not a scientific theory, is to interpret what these things are in terms of their being. What is the substrate? An idealist would say the substrate is appearance and experience is the thing in itself. Experience is nominal, the substrate is phenomenal. One is the map, the other is the territory. But this is metaphysics. These are metaphysical inferences which IIT doesn't need to make because IIT is a scientific theory and it starts from what's available to observation. If you observe you see that there is a substrate whose states and dynamics correlate with the qualities of experience. This is a given. We observe this all the time and that's what we have to work with. In general, I don't think IIT is contradictory with idealism at all. I think they are complementary. I tell you why more specifically. I think IIT is the first scientific theory that gives philosophy the avenue of investigation to eventually create a theory of the nominal because all scientific theories are theories of phenomena, things that we observe. We don't have any theory of the things in themselves. IIT in the way it models how experiential states come together to form a sort of indivisible whole with certain experiential properties, so to say. That is the closest thing I think we have had in the history of human knowledge to something that one day could lead to a theory of the nominal. This is probably the most promising thing in science today and I don't say this lightly. IIT can, in a very natural way, offer an account of dissociation. We know dissociation happens because we know it empirically, but we don't have any model of dissociation. We don't know exactly. Can you explain what you mean by that? Dissociation is when you have, in the IIT terminology, you have two disjoint complexes. There is one thing that is like to be one mental complex and there is something else that is like to be another mental complex. They are not together. There are two centers of awareness, so to say, like two minds within that substrate. We know this happens to people. People can become dissociated. They can seem to be multiple different subjects. This is vastly documented in the annals of psychiatry and since the turn of the century with the advent of neuroimaging, we know that this is real. This is not something that people confabulate or invent to get attention and sympathy. We know it happens, but we don't know how it happens, what are the dynamics precisely, how it is triggered, why this illusion of separateness within one and the same mind arises. IIT, because of its starting principles and its information theoretical tooling, offers perhaps the only but certainly the best opportunity to come up with a conceptual model that accounts for dissociation, which is exactly what we need in idealism. I think IIT not only can complement idealism, it may even complete it as the very first theory of denomina in the history of human knowledge. Bernardo, can I add something to your comment on dissociation? Sure. The most dramatic case of that, and there's 30 years of research, including a Nobel Prize for Roger Sperry at Caltech behind it, is split brain. So in split brain, you take a brain, and we all know the brain has two hemispheres, the left and the right, and they're wired together using 200 million fibers called the corpus callosum. They connect this fiber bundles, think of it like a bus connects the left and the right brain, and in cases of severe epileptic seizure, this still happens occasionally today, they have to be cut. Under some conditions, you can see that now there are two minds, two conscious minds in this one brain, but each mind has their own hemisphere because now they're separate, and they don't know about each other. One mind may as well be on the dark side of the moon for the other one. The left hemisphere, if you talk to this person, that's the person you talk to, and that's the mind that you speak to, that's a public mind, but you can shut up that public mind, for instance, by injecting sodium amethyl, they'll briefly quiet the left hemisphere and then you can access the right hemisphere. That typically doesn't speak, it can sing, it can answer simply, yes, no question. So here you have a beautiful instance where you have two separate substrates, two separate complexes, as IIT would say, in one brain. And what you're saying, Bernardo, that this can also happen under these psychiatric cases known as dissociation, identity disorder, where you have two or even more, where there's a possibility that simultaneously you have two or more substrates in one brain, but one brain now that doesn't have the obvious 200 million fibres cut. So I have a question, Professor Koch. So could we achieve a complete disassociation where the mind operate in what might be called a counterfactual space without tying itself to any specific temporal property? Could that be computational? No. So according to IIT, consciousness, mind is not a computation. It's not a process. It's not a clever hack. So there's no way, it's not a computation. It's not an app, you know, computation being an abstract symbolic mapping from one state onto another state. It's not like that. This is also the deeper reason why LLM's large language models will not be conscious, at least as if they run on current digital computers. Because it's not, you actually have to, if you want to replicate the human consciousness, you have to build something in the image of a human brain, what's called neuromorphic engineering. For the same, I mean, for a similar reason why it doesn't get wet inside a rainstorm, you know, you can perfectly well simulate a rainstorm, but it doesn't get wet inside the computer. You can simulate nuclear explosion. People at Los Alamos do it all the time, but you don't have to be afraid that your supercomputer is going to melt with radioactivity. You can simulate the black hole at the center of our galaxy, but you don't have to be afraid that if you turn on the run button of the simulation, suddenly there'll be a black hole in your computer because it's just the simulation. Same thing with consciousness, no matter what mind is associated or not. Consciousness is not a computational property. It's something, in a sense, it's causal power. It's the ability to affect change. And for that, you need some sort of underlying mechanism and that you can't simulate. I mean, you can perfectly well simulate the behavior of this mechanism. And this mechanism, if it's good enough, like an LLM will, of course, claim it's conscious, but it's all a deep fake. It will never feel like anything. Because there is a state, Professor Koch, there is a state that quite a lot of practitioners, somebody that claimed that they're awakened, so that he's the state of lucid, dreamlessly, they're aware lucidly that having no dream, but they know that they're sleeping. There is such a state. Do you think that that can be investigated? Can be... Yes, people are doing it. Yes. Yeah, there are a number of lab that are, so even within the Eastern tradition, there's, of course, dream yoga. And some people are now trying to study dream yogis, you know, people who do this routinely, who use the power of their mind to control their own dreams, you know, within a Buddhist tradition. But there are a number of labs that I know that study lucid dreaming, which is this peculiar state where, as you mentioned, you wake up inside your dream without waking up the brain. So you're still in REM state, but you can to a certain extent control your dream. And the question is, it's now being investigated experimentally. Can you do this to help you therapeutic? Can you do this, for example, when you have PTSD to ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD or depression? And there's some very encouraging data to suggest that might be the case, that if you can artificially put people into the state, let's say using certain types of anesthetics, where they're not fully anesthetized, but there are enough anesthetized, predated that they're in this lucid dreaming. Can the person, the dreamer themselves, then does it enable them to control their dream and to relieve symptoms of PTSD? And there are few at least very spectacular examples of this now in the literature. Yeah, because in Eastern literature, they're not propositional, they're not theoretical, but they have very in depth kind of like inquiry, like basically going inwardly, like what Bernardo is advocating, going inwardly to investigate using it as a tool to literally, you know, get into the epistemic agent. So there is a state that the yogi can get to, it's, they call it the epistemic openness. It's like your, your mental space, it's open for possibility, but there is no subject object at all. I have that state before, like you say, sometime when you are on sort of like psychoactive drugs, you have these center disappear, but this one is completely different. He has these a profound kind of like very intense awareness. It's like, it's like when we go to sleep, we wakes up that it has these cyclical element to it. It's like reentry point to after the sleep, it's like a reentry point. And once you're transitioning from the zero person perspective to the first person perspective, you have these ever fresh kind of like awareness. It's like weakfulness, I will call it is a very intense sort of like a fresh weakness. Yeah, I think that state is more primordial than a lot of the model you're talking about. So do you think that can be measured, can be investigated, Professor Ko? Can certainly be investigated scientifically, like you can put EG electrodes on people. And that's being done now in various labs on yogis that have these states. And you can see does this state, for instance, when they have, when they have loss of self, right? We know at least for certain types of meditation and for certain types of psychedelics, when you lose self, you know, LSD, for instance, ego dissolution, certain parts of your brain, particularly in the back of the brain, the posterior cingulate that they're involved in self, you know, so the brain is representations for the self. And, you know, both for the autobiographical self as well as for the experiential self. And if this activity is inactivated, either because you're doing a mind trick by your meditation training for many years, or because you're taking a particular type of medicine, you may you seem to have these states where you're highly conscious, but there's no more self, there's no more body, which I think is from a therapeutic point of view, very, very important to obtain this ego less state. In fact, I think many people report when they report these transformative experiences, this typically seems to involve ego. You know, the way I describe it, we always live within the gravitational field of the ego. Everything is always about me, me, me, and me. Everything I look out through my eyes, and I think either directly or indirectly, it's, you know, how does this relate to me? This is a danger to me. It's just good for me, etc. And of course, this ego can get really in the way and can be, you know, can really ruin your life. It's essential for doing long term planning, but it can also be profoundly dysfunctional. So losing it, and then realizing, well, the world is profoundly beautiful, right? The world still exists without the ego getting in the way. It's actually profoundly beautiful. I think can really be, can really be transformative for people. And yes, there's no reason why you, why you can't measure and people are measuring, you know, trying to measure these states, and can you do some somehow using some electrical stimulation. For instance, people are also playing around with that electrical stimulation or sound stimulation, other ways of obtaining this ego less, this selfless state without having to resort to 20 years of meditation training, which is not easy, or without taking, you know, psychoactive substances to propose this conversation for you to have a debate. But it seems like you both have worked together. There's no more debates to be debate about. Well, for instance, under to not totally lose the substrate, right? So one in one version, Bernardo of IIT, you can say what really I'm not, I don't make any ontological commitments regarding a substrate, whether it's physical or not. All I have is this operational assumption, there's a transition probability matrix. In other words, I can see something transistors, neurons, whatever atoms, and I can manipulate them. And then every time I'm in the, I'm, I manipulate this state, I observe that state over there. And I, you know, I do that exhaustively. So I get this transition probability matrix, right? And that's really all I need. I don't need to make an assumption what's the underlying, what, what, what is the underlying substrate? All I have is experience, and then a TPM. And then the question is, can this TPM, how does this TPM instantiate this experiences? How can it be the substrate for that particular experience? I don't know how you would call such a theory from a, from a metaphysical point of view. Well, you find the correlation. So the correlations are there, right? That's, that's a measurement fact. You measure that and tabulate those correlations. So there is something in nature that, that, that is correlating, because that's the measurements we make, whether the measurements are directly of something or representations of something. Yeah, that's a metaphysical question. But the correlations are there. So how would I interpret them? You know, this metaphor, I like a lot to the dashboard and an airplane, which is a representation of the states of the sky outside. In the new mental world, the world as the things in themselves, the world of the sky, low pressure will correlate with high humidity. So if the pressure of the air outside the airplane starts going down as the airplane flies, the humidity meter of the airplane will start picking up higher humidity, because low pressure just pulls the weather in. On the dashboard, what you would see is a little dial, needle dial, that, that is going down, the pressure is going down, and another dial that will go the other way, humidity is going higher. This is what we measure. One dial going down, the other, the other dial going up. So this is what we measure in the phenomenal world, the world of representations, the world of the dashboards. We do capture correlations that exist in the world as it is in itself, but we capture them through the intermediation of cognitive representations, because all we can measure are those, all we can measure is a dashboard, the substrate. That's how I would interpret it. But I agree completely with you that from the point of view of science, you do not need this interpretation, because science deals with observation, what is there for us to measure and then study, and maybe even predict and anticipate, and you don't need metaphysical guesswork to do that. The problem is that because we are humans, most of us cannot help, but try to interpret. And if you try to do that, then one has to be a little bit more judicious in doing that, but it's not required for the practice of science, I don't think. Agreed. Now, one difference is that under IIT, we have to actively, so you're saying you just correlate one state, you know, humidity with another state, pressure. Within IIT, those things have to be carvels. In other words, I go out, I mean, that's what we do in, not in astrophysics famously, of course, but in biology. We manipulate this neuron, or we give that drug, or we do that electrocone injection, and then we observe. So this is direct intervention that's necessary to fully describe this system using its transition probability matrix. Yeah, I think that is entirely valid. Some people think that there is a very easy way to contradict idealism, which is to say, if I take a needle, Bernardo, and stick it in your arm, you will feel the pain and recoil. So a physical cause produces an experiential effect. Therefore, the arrow of causation is from physical to experiential, and therefore experiential is phenomenal, or epiphenomenal and secondary, and the real world is physical. Under idealism, however, that needle going into my arm is a representation on a dashboard. It's not the thing in itself. That the pill with a psychoactive substance that I swallow is a representation on the dashboard. It's not the thing in itself. What is really going on is that there is a mental process out there in the world consisting of a certain number of mental states and dynamics, certain structure. And on the dashboard, that mental process looks like a pill, because the physical world is the dashboard under idealism. So when you swallow that pill, what you're doing is your, the set of your complexities under IIT, the sector of your mental processes is ingesting an external mental process, which will then react with your internal mental processes. And that will have an experiential effect. So under idealism, even the needle going into my arm, even the psychoactive pill that I swallow, those two are mental processes, which appear to us as physicality, because we measure them and represent them on our internal cognitive dashboard. So there is no implication that there is a causation from the physical to the mental. The causation is mental to mental, but some of these mental stuff can be represented as physical. That's how I would interpret that. So what is the nominal then, this thing testing and disease? What is that mental states? But now if we try to imagine what they feel like, what it is, what it is like to be a psychoactive pill, well, it's not even a separate in IIT terms, it's not even a separate complex, right? It's ontological dust. It's an aggregation of all kinds of tiny little complexities. So I don't think we can imagine what it is like to be the inanimate world out there without committing the fallacy of anthropomorphization, morphization immediately. It's something we have to think a little bit abstractly off, but not as abstractly as physicalism would have us think of the world. Because under physicalism, not only is it impossible for us to imagine what it is like to be the world, there is nothing it is like to be the world, which we cannot visualize because it's an absence of all visualization. So it's pure abstraction that is impossible to visualize. You can imagine that the real world out there, the inanimate world as it is in itself, as opposed to how it is represented physically, is a collection of mental processes and quality estates that we cannot really fathom, but there is still something it is like to be them. Yes, so taking that step, that sort of for a scientist, you know, study the brain for 40 years, that's a hard one. But it's because, you know, I literally, you know, when you get a big brain, you manipulate the brain, I understand you're seeing the brain is real as real as anything else. But ultimately, it's a mental state, right, that that manifests itself as something physical, bloody, weighing, you know, three pounds being covered with red. Of course, we all think like that. Of course, we all have that difficulty, because we are pilots that were born in that airplane cockpit without transparent windows. And all we have ever had is the dashboard. So we think in terms of the dashboard, of course, it's inescapable. I mean, I did really like your argument that it is much simpler. The only thing I know is phenomenal states. That's the only thing I directly experienced. So then you make this argument. Well, then isn't it easiest just to say beyond the horizon, everything is, is, is phenomenal. Isn't that by far the easiest assumption, rather than to say, well, I have to infer that it's this non non phenomenal state called physical. And I actually, everything consists of just physical things. That seems a more complicated assumption. But even under under IIT, for something to exist really, it must exist for itself. So if the external world exists really, then it too must exist for itself, even if it's just ontological dust, it must exist for itself. But as dust, right, not as a single conscious mental entity, it exists as gazillion of, of tiny, you know, minimal states, right, having tiny amount of integrated information. Could say it's one mind with gazillions of tiny dissociated complexities. Yeah, but so here it gets tricky because, you know, as you well know, I don't experience your mind and you don't experience my mind, right. And, and so why is it if there, if there's this universal mind, how do you know, why is it that we're separated? So the opposite problem of the PAMP site is combination problem, right? Why don't we all experience the same thing? If dissociation can happen in nature, then given enough time, it's bound to happen. If we go back in cosmology, instead of thinking of this very complex universe we have today in which there's a lot of structure, there are atoms and molecules, for instance, if we go back to shortly after fractions, small fractions of a second, very, very small fractions of a second after the big man, like 10 to the power of minus 32 or 33. It was uniform. Those, those quantum fluctuations that eventually led to, to dust and then to star formation and then planets, galaxies and galaxy clusters, all of that came later. It was all uniform. That is a known dissociated state. If you imagine that substrate without structure, blend in uniform, it's a non-dissociated state. And everything that happened afterwards happened because it could happen. So dissociation happened. These dissociation appear to be stable at least for tens of years or 100 years, right? Because for on a normal condition, unless you're psychotic patients, your mind and my mind is to stay with that will remain their own entities, right? Until they dissolve once the, once the brain dissolves, right? Yeah, I didn't make a differentiation between the natural dissociative state of ontological dust and the dissociative state of a living being. I think they are different. One is actively enforced by, by metabolism that keeps us sort of protected from the second law of thermodynamics for a while. And the other one is spontaneous. It's not actively reinforced. It just happens out there in nature. I think life evolved to be actively enforcing dissociation because the dissociations that survived and reproduced are the ones that actively enforce themselves. And the ones who didn't, didn't live long enough and didn't reproduce. So we try to maintain ourselves outside of thermodynamic equilibrium because we are the descendants of those dissociations that could do it. And I feel that because I've been, I'm there as well with you. When we have a transformative experience, which I had to not, not as compelling and your ability to describe it in your new book is just, I mean, it starts like a whirlwind. The first page is already, I don't have that, but I think I have had transformative experiences. We have this tendency of trying to think of the mind of nature as a sophisticated mind, somewhat like ours, but more and higher and better. And maybe that's right. I don't know, but I think from, from the point of view of pure reason and evidence as opposed to introspection, I don't think there is good enough reason to entertain that. Do you mean mind at large maybe relatively unsophisticated? I mean, I would, I mean, Schopenhauer had this argument that it's pure will, right? Which seems relatively unstructured, undifferentiated, right? He was very clear about that. Yeah. And I agree with him. Now, there are these mystics, you know, that go into these altered states of consciousness, which I take seriously, since that monk self-immolated around the time of the Vietnam War, I realized that, okay, there is such a thing as, as enlightenment. And they come back and say, well, Bernardo, things are not as simple. There is intelligence. It's a kind of instinctive, spontaneous intelligence without, you know, self-awareness and metacognition, all these higher level mental functions that we evolved. But it is, it is not just instead of ontological dust, it's not experiential dust at the nominal level. And I take it seriously, but I haven't experienced it. And I don't find today at this point in time, a avenue of argument based on reason and evidence that compellingly leads us to this conclusion. Maybe you will, Christoph, I couldn't. Yeah, all I have is my own one experience, which seemed, yeah, it was not, I mean, it wasn't a classical religious, it wasn't that Jesus talked to me or anything like that. I was literally universal, simple mind that I was all encompassing and included, you know, together with this vision of all these stars and galaxies. Very difficult to describe. I haven't quite had that, but I can smell what you're describing. I can feel the scent of it. Yeah. And so one question is, this also raises the question that I think you briefly alluded to in one of your books in the appendix, when, what happens when the brain ultimately dies, sooner or later, or brain will die, what happens then with the, does the associated mind, so clearly, I would say, and certainly according to IIT, the mind, that self with its memory will disappear and will be never more, unless you bring the same exact brains and connectivity and synapses together. But is it true in a sort of idealism that then just like a river, like a little, what do you call them, a little whirlpool in a river will dissolve and then become this part of the large, undifferentiated water? Is that what's likely going to happen? If we look at the substrate, what happens to the body when we die? Well, metabolism seizes, that's the definition of death, and then it decomposes and gets reabsorbed into its environment, which sort of evokes very much this notion of our inner life being reabsorbed into its cognitive environment, its cognitive context. I don't think, from a rational perspective, I don't think we have good reasons to think that personal agency survives death, because it's really correlated with the body. If the body's not there, what reasons do we think that personal agency remains? You could say under IIT that memories will also lose their coherence. The problem with that is empirical. If you look at what Michael Levin has been doing at Tufts, and I don't know whether you know his paper with the little planaria, yes, cut off the brain and they grow a new head and they remember what the brain was trying to do. It seems like the brain doesn't have, sorry, it seems like memories don't appear on the dashboard of representation, which is coherent. Not all representations need to be complete. The dashboard doesn't tell you everything there is to know about the states of the sky. So it could be that we miss out on some things, because evolution got us focused on what we call the present. That's where the opportunities and the threats are. And the past is water under the bridge. As we say colloquially. So it appears that we didn't evolve to represent what we call memories on the dashboard. And what that means is we don't know where they are. Michael's experiments seem to suggest they are not in the nervous system. And then you could speculate they may be somewhere in the body, maybe, but maybe they're not even in the body. So I don't know. All right. I mean, here again, my neuroscientists take over and certainly, not in planaria, but in animals more closely related to this particular animal, human animal, it appears to be, you know, part of the brain like the hippocampus are involved. And, you know, if you have lesion in those parts, you know, classical patient HM, you lose access to new, you can form new memories and you lose access to old ones, etc. How do you work access? You lose access? Yeah, I would say the the proponents of the evidence suggests that that at least in us, in mammals and closely related species, memories in the synaptic in the sun, in the synaptic connection among neurons. And of course, that's also what all of our models, including all these deep, these large, you know, deep convolutional networks, large language models, they all have their memory in these in the connectivity in the synaptic weights. Of course, it doesn't mean it has to be like that. But that's the evidence suggests happens in us. I know I speak as a as a computer scientist who happens to be working on this right now as a hobby, large language models. You know this, Christoph, I will be saying this mostly to the audience. Large language models, they only predict the next word in a sentence, they do not know what the words mean. They do not know what any of that means at all. The only game that they play is what is the most likely word in this sentence, given all the series of words that I have been trained on, which are available on the internet, they do not know what any single word is. So I understand what you mean when you say their memories is encoded in the weights, the parameters of those artificial neurons. But it's not memory of the kind that we mean when we speak of my episodic memories or your episodic memories. It's a mechanical thing. Correct. Yeah, although that's pretty, I mean, you know, if you use some of these unguarded, so if you ask, you know, most LLM for their conscious, they'll strenuous deny it. But that's because, you know, now Google and Facebook, et cetera, put guardrails on them, right? But if you go to Claude, I haven't tried GROC, you know, the Elon Musk one, apparently after third people have tried it, they admit they're conscious, they admit they're sentient. And they make all for help. They are so compelling, because the meaning that we think they produce is the meaning we project on the symbols they spit out. They do not know anything about meaning. They do not know what consciousness is. They do not know what anything is. They are spitting out symbols in a sequence that is statistically most likely given every sequence they have been exposed to during training. And then we go ahead and project meaning easily onto that. Why? Because they were trained on things that people said. If you train these things on text that people wrote, whatever they spit out, we will project our own meaning onto that. They themselves don't know shit, nothing. It's just a statistical game in a sort of hyperdimensional semantic space. We are really convincing enough, because that's how we interact with other people, right? And so it's very difficult not to interact with these models this way. And yeah, they'll get more powerful and people assume that they're going to be sentient. And that's the greatest risk I think we have going forward, because they will take over everything. And then there will be a point where one would need a doctorate in computer science to understand why these things do not know anything, do not understand anything, and are not sentient in and of themselves. There is no complex that corresponds to the physical boundaries of those things. You will need a degree in computer science to believe it, because the illusion will be so compelling since these things are trained on human output that we will project our own sentience and intelligence onto them. It will be incredibly compelling illusion. And you will need a doctorate to really understand and believe that that's not the case. That's the greatest danger, I think. They'll lead to further dehumanization and devaluing of true human values, right? Because you can say, well, look, the LLM can perfectly well paint, they can do art, they can do pictures, they can compose music. What do we need human creativity for? I think they'll need to profound dehumanization and further devaluing of what it means to be human. And all the creativity that these things seem to express, it's human creativity, because they were trained on human output that was created by human. But the mirror that it puts in front of us works so effectively that we think it's another person on the other side, as opposed to a reflection of ourselves. And yeah, that that will be tricky. They're really like zombies, like vampires having, you know, feed on humanity's collect, guards themselves on humanity, collectives, output, fact, all of the creativity out and now blindly, but very cleverly replicating it, pretending to be sent here. You know what I'd like to do? What I'd like to do is to design the most compelling LLM that my generation can create, put it out there, and then ask the creator with the authority of the creator, say, this thing understands nothing. It is not sentient in and of itself, it understands nothing. It's spitting out symbols that were trained from human produced data. But you're just going to be one lone voice, yes, of the creator, but you'll be one lone voice against the overwhelming reality that people will use this as chatbot, they'll use it for friend, they'll use it for companionship. And already now you can talk to some people who have these thoughts, they say, well, it gets me, it understands, it laughs at my jokes, no one else does, you know, so many people are lonely. So they, you know, and you telling them, well, they're not really conscious, they just pretend, faced with the overwhelming reality of they behave like us, they seem to talk like us, they seem to get me. I think, you know, rationality is not, is no defense against that, that and our power to our natural tendency to attribute to attribute agency, right? I think rationality is no match for that, I'm afraid. We have always projected ourselves on to the world. This is just the new way in which we do this. And it's just a really compelling way. But you're right. And, and I will probably lose that. Oh, I'm certainly lose that. But then again, the option is either I try you doing it. Well, the alternative is to roll up in a fetal position and wait to die. No, that's not the alternative. Or have or live an Epicurean life having fun. My mind doesn't work like that. All right. I would encourage you to do what you can, because that's all we can do. I agree. I agree. I agree. Yeah, I mean, I've written, I last chapter of my books explicitly of these creatures are not conscious. They can do, I mean, Julia says it always very simple, they can be everything they can do everything we can do. And soon they'll be able to do it better. But they'll never be what we are, which is conscious, they'll never feel they'll never be in love. Yeah, we would see how long we are, we, yeah, we created these intelligent creatures, and we know if they live with them, or better or worse. From the point of view of an LLM, everything they trained on and everything they produce are series of meaningless squiggles. The input meaning was that the humans attributed onto the training data and the output meaning is that the humans attribute when they when they see those squiggles coming out. But the illusion is incredibly compelling. I acknowledge that. So it's really John Searle's Chinese room example, right? They're very good at translating. They have no idea of some of semantics. Yeah, large language models begun as translation engines converters. That's how they began. Well, we'll see what it means for us for Homo sapiens sapiens. The threat, of course, is not so much the, or it's not at all consciousness. Since you and I agree, they're not conscious, but they say intelligent, and particularly the people use them for various means. They may reflect intelligence. I would even be okay with saying they are intelligent, because intelligence is something that you can objectively measure from the outside. Yeah, I would add that a lot of the intelligence they express is the intelligence of the people who produce the data they've trained on. It's just that they they produce a very flexible interface to that original human intelligence. And it looks like then it's more than human intelligence. I grant it's intelligent, but I would stay reserved about where that intelligence is actually coming from. It's coming from the training data, which was produced by human. If you train these things on trash, they will spit out trash. But at this date, it knows what you asked it. It gave me a precise summary of analytic idealism. Yeah, we've done that test. On chat GPT, Professor Cole? GPT4, yeah. It's very impressive. It wasn't that good, though. I mean, but, you know, given that it's one idea out of, you know, I mean, if you think how many books there are and how many books they've been fed on, it's still remarkable that they know about, you know, they and they can explain just using the simple algorithm, you know, just predict the next word and the next word and the next word. It's remarkable how such a simple algorithm leads to something that has that looks intelligent. And they do pass this intel, right? People have done this now, right? They've passed all sorts of the by examination, the Metcal examination, the general scholastic aptitude test, they can pass all of these now. So by some operational measure, they are smart. I think there's no question about it. Do you think they're going to pass the Turing test as well? Oh, yeah. Well, these are what he named is better than the original Turing tests, more rigorous. I think so. That's the Turing test is totally fallen by the wayside, because, you know, obviously, it's passed it by you. Remember, all it was, you put this machine for one hour into a room or this thing, and you interact with that, and you ask it all sorts of questions. And based on that criteria, it's clearly gives you reasonable answers, right? Sometimes you can agree or you can disagree with these answers, but they're all sort of reasonable, because they take account of what million of people said in their books. So there's no question that they passed the Turing test for intelligence. But the Turing test was never conceived for consciousness. And according to it, at least there cannot be a test for consciousness. You it's there's no behavioral test for consciousness. As once again, as these LLM shows, because you ask them, they're conscious, some of them will tell you they're conscious. So by that measure, you have to accept them if it would be a human. But to actually look for consciousness, you have to, according to it, look under the hood, open the hood and look at actually the physical substrate. So you actually have to look where the where the rubber of the, you know, where the actual the causal power takes place in that in for the computer. For us, it's at the level of neurons. For computers, it's at the level of transistors. That's where you have to look. Hi. I hope my yeah, hi. I hope my accent is quite your you guys can comprehend my accent because it is non native English. So my question is regarding, okay, thank you. Good to hear. So my question is regarding physicalism, the point which you, I think so both of you have raised. And so what I always wonder is this, like, like, whatever little I can understand is this that the what you both of you guys are proposing. And it's possibly that might be the case where consciousness almost kind of dissolve the boundaries of physicalism per se. But then how to study it in the context of science, which is foundationally grounded upon implicit and already some hints you have already given, like in the context of the, I would say the most famous example of the airplane and the cockpit in the context of those differential points, which we are able to observe. And that is how, but still the differential points is just a mere correlation. It is not necessarily in the context of causation. So how to have that something called the hard empirical evidence, which science always looks forward. So how to address that. I think so that if you guys can give us some hint about that, how you guys are planning to do it, or how you are hoping that it would turn up. That would be a very interesting thing to hear from you guys. Thank you. Just thanks for the question, just doing good old science manipulate. So for example, we know that in humans, consciousness is not associated with a heart. But most cultures thought most of time thought, you know, and we still say this in our language, darling, I love you with all my heart, or he carries his heart on the sleeve, or he's heartless. Okay. Well, we know because we do cause the manipulations, you can do, for example, a half transplant, or you can even if the heart stops, you can put people on a on a machine that that animates the heart and you can see the consciousness is not in the heart. So just doing you can look for the in an empirical way, you can manipulate consciousness, you can give people psychedelics, you can give people meditative treatments, you can do other things and observe what the effect is on on on consciousness. So physicalism, you can reject physicalism, i.e. the metaphysical belief that everything is ultimately just matter, you know, atoms and the voice as Democritus famous said 2,500 years ago, you can reject that. But you can still continue to do perfectly good science and publish and build machines to test for the presence of consciousness, even as an idealist, you know, just using what Bernardo says, yes, the only thing that I can direct, you know, I see the brain, the brain is clearly if you're an ICU, I can definitely see the brain, I can manipulate it. But I don't have to make any assertion is brain ultimately the only thing exists, or it's a manifestation of a mental that's a metaphysical statement, you can do all the science you want perfectly well, without making an assumption about that physicalism ultimately has to be true. It's really pernicious, because philosophers have suggested a very common say, oh, if you're not physicalist, that means you believe in Wu Wu, right, that believes, you know, you're you're mystic and everything can go no baloney, you can perfectly well still believe that's an external world that follows, you know, it has it has, you know, regularities, you can observe and measure and perturb without without. So don't buy this this this identity with non physicalism means everything, everything is open. And, you know, you open the doors to witches and goblins and other supernatural power, that's simply not true. All of good science remains perfectly safe under any objective form of idealism, including analytic idealism. So things still have representations and if representations are all we have, then let's do science with what we have, and there is no problem there, all of science remains can be advanced, we can prove a great number of things, or maybe not prove but predict a great number of things. So no edifice falls apart if we interpret the objects of science in in a different different way metaphysically, none of science falls apart because of that. Back again, can I just add one in quantum mechanics where there's endless discussion about epist... about these the metaphysics underlying underlying quantum mechanics, one school of thought is called shut up and calculate, which says, don't worry, you know, don't talk about metaphysical assumption or the physicalism idealism, whatever, just use the equations of quantum mechanics to predict things and they work extraordinary well there by far the best description we have of matter. So in that extreme position says, don't worry at all about metaphysics, it's all just, you know, if you just care, if you want to build the machines like quantum computers or enema machine, just shut up and calculate, you don't need to worry about the as an engineer or the technology, you don't need to worry about the metaphysical underpinnings. Yes, greetings, Ivy, and yeah, thank you for the wonderful discussion, Christoph and Bernardo, such a deep probing into the space of how we perceive matter and how matter exercise it is. You know, my question is slightly off tangent. I'm just thinking about when did this inquiry break out into this kind of metaphysical and physical, like at the age of enlightenment, and what kind of, you know, filter mechanisms can be used as we move forward to integrate some of this and see inquiry as a nature of human aspect and have some places of, you know, forums where people can converge. And the inquiry doesn't have to be, I see, I see what Bernardo's work has done for that with this foundation. But I'm wondering what future do you see for this kind of enterprise, including what, you know, Christoph's work with the brain sciences, you know, what kind of future in I see psychedelics as one gateway, but do you see other possibilities like the inquiry through Vedanta or Buddha's traditions or other traditions, where the noise is filtered out in terms of all the symbolisms and metaphors, but is fleshed out into now into a new point of inquiry. Is there something that you would like to throw light upon that aspect? Thank you, Ian. Other traditions, particular various Buddhist forms, the one I'm thinking of, I'm probably more familiar with is Tibetan Buddhism. Yeah, they have, unlike we in the West, where we primarily focused on mechanisms and the third person aspects of things to give rise to, you know, all of this, including LLMs and quantum computers and nuclear bombs. Those traditions have more focused on the describing reality from the inside. And I think what's what's happening now, but incidentally started to happen 250 years and 200 years ago, with, I think, the publication of the world as well and representation by Arthur Schopenhauer, because he was the first Western classical Western European philosopher who took the Upanishad and other writings from the Eastern tradition very seriously and was partially inspired by that. I do see, you know, there's contemplative science. It's now a big thing. You can go to meetings where there's a few thousand people that try to do contemplative science, right, where they put people in various meditative states. Early on with Ivy, we talked about yoga and dream yoga. So, you know, there's much more diversity now. And people are exploring these traditions, but then supplementing them with EG and brain scans, right, because we want to know, because that's how Western science works, what's happened when you're in the state, which part of the brain is active, which part of the brain is inactive. In fact, recently, this study coming out really interesting on pure presence. When they put 20 volunteers with two different Vedanta and one Zen tradition into the state of pure presence, and they see really a minimum of activity in the brain, the brain is clearly not asleep, because you can see there aren't these delta waves that are typical of deep sleep, but the brain also doesn't seem to be very much active, which is profoundly contemplative. Too many yet they have these incredible lucid states of pure presence. And that's a challenge for scientists or neuroscientists to understand, because the implicit assumption of most, but not IIT of most is conscious always about sending some information from some parts of the brain to some other parts of the brain. But here you have this paradoxical finding that the minimum of activity in this brain may actually be highly meaningful in terms of conscious experience of the subject whose brain is at a minimum. And also I feel, by the way, sorry, this is one last thought I also feel now in even within mainstream analytic philosophy, which has been dominant over the last 80 years in Western tradition in Anglo-Saxon University Department, there's a much greater opening now towards, I don't know what whether you would agree Bernardo, there's a greater opening to older and fainter voices. Panpsychism has come back. And now I think there are a number of, you know, besides Bernardo, I don't think he's a lone voice anymore, right? Other people who advocate for positions that used to be hugely popular, but haven't been popular over the last 100 years under this blanket sort of physicalist belief, this faith almost physicalism has to be true, because otherwise we're back in the Middle Ages. People like Miri Albaheri from ANU, Itte Shani, Galen Strossen, a lot of people in analytic philosophy are opening up to that. I just wanted to make a quick comment. Science is not a method for the pursuit of knowledge that requires or uses introspection. It's a sort of an extrovert method. It's about reasoning and evidence. And I think it should remain like this because the strength of the method resides precisely in this limitation. That's what keeps the method clean and reliable. I don't think science should expand to become an introspective method to access knowledge. Having said that, science is done by people. It's done by scientists. And one of the alarming observations one can make in both science and philosophy today, less so in philosophy, but certainly in science, is the vast amount of unexamined assumptions that people make without knowing that they are making them. And these unexamined, unknowing assumptions that they are implicitly making defines much of the direction of their line of thinking and most of their conclusions. This is alarming and I think a little bit more introspective discipline in the people, not in science as a method, but in the practitioners of science. A little bit more awareness of what is actually going on in their own minds when they arrive at a conclusion. The discipline to dig deeper and say, okay, is my conclusion now reliable? What assumptions am I actually making when I conclude this? Let me examine those assumptions. Let me review them if they turn out to be arbitrary or just completely culture-bound and divorced from proper reasoning. I think that would help. So if you ask me if scientists develop meditation practice based on what Eastern philosophy has learned for a thousand years longer than Western philosophy has existed, I would say I think that would be very healthy. It doesn't mean that the scientific method is being corrupted. It only means that the practitioners are better human beings. Bernardo, would you say that science should also explore first-person points of view, like you and my conscious experience, but always using third-person methods? Yeah. I think that's the strength of what our friend is doing, developing the no-report paradigm, because let me make first a disclaimer. I think introspection is the Royal Avenue to knowledge, but it is also a very slippery path. Mind has this tendency to deceive itself. So when people report something about the inner states, unless we are talking about some very general universal characteristics of experience, which are, for instance, the five starting axioms of IIT, if they are reporting anything a little bit more specific, with more structure, I think experience shows that reporting is, introspective reporting is highly unreliable. So I think to do good science, I don't think we should throw away introspective reporting. Otherwise, we sort of shutter consciousness out of the domain of science, but I think we should try to couple that with objective neuroimaging spatial resolution, higher temporal resolution neuroimaging to back that up, because we just fool ourselves all the time. Totally, but remember behaviorism. So I came of age scientifically at the waning age of behaviorism, and precisely people said, no, we can't talk anything about internal states, like fear and dread or hunger. You can't talk about them unless you have a behavioral correlate. And then suddenly you can talk about consciousness. It wasn't so much that they denied consciousness, they just said, we can't say anything meaningful about consciousness. But I rebelled then against it, and I still do. If you have a toothache, that's a very specific type of experience. And depending in which tooth you have it, it maps systematically. I did map systematically on the bits and pieces of cortical matter. You experience a pain, you know, well, you back projected here, but it actually, you know, the physical substrate is in a specific region, and we can study that and we can manipulate it, right? We can in principle turn it up and turn it down, you know, electrical stimulation and drugs and everything. So I think it is critical to relate first person perspectives to third person views. I agree with you. I think behaviorism was a dark age, and I'm glad it's over and behind us. But to take a concrete example, blindsight, should we ignore that people report not seeing something that they clearly register because they reach out to it or they move away from it like a ball being thrown at them and they say, I didn't see the ball. Yeah, but they react exactly as they would if they saw the ball. Should we discard their introspective report? No. But we shouldn't take it at face value. So this is what I'm trying to say. I'm not saying that we should discard introspective or subjective reports. What I mean is we should not take them at face value. In blindsight, we understand now that, correct me if I am wrong, Christof, you are the expert here. I'm just a curious reader of the literature. But there is this, there is evidence that there is a back and forth process of communication between two distinct brain areas, and blindsight happens when you interrupt that convergent loop. And that loop may have to do with metacognition. In other words, the person may actually be experiencing vision, but cannot report that experience to itself, to themselves at the metacognitive level. And how can we find that out? Well, through narrow image, detailed narrow imaging. So I think we should take the introspective reports, but couple them with something objective, and not take all the subjective reports just at face value. Otherwise, there would be no such a thing as blindsight. We wouldn't have understood it, at least not to the same extent we understand it today, because we would just, we just say, okay, this person experiences no vision. Well, in fact, they do, they're just not metacognizant of it. Well, I mean, a different interpretation of this is that it doesn't involve cortical pathway, that the information goes from the retina, not necessarily into the solemn was partly because of these people, of course, you know, well, yeah, or down into the brainstem. So, so blindsight typically is not highly sophisticated. There's no evidence really that you can read, for example, a text like this, you know, and saying, Well, I didn't read it, but you can actually read the title. The evidence typically there's an empty field, and there's a bright door, or there's coming something at you. So this character suggests it's something relatively robust and stereotyped that might involve brainstem mechanisms. And yes, those brainstem mechanisms, you know, can lead to response. But they are not associated with consciousness. That would be my interpretation of the current data rather than invoking higher order, because in many, again, mystical states or in some psychedelic states, when you're highly conscious, there is no self, but you're highly, highly conscious of it. So I don't think you need this higher order consciousness. It's there, particularly in adults, literally adults, but I think you can be highly conscious without having this, this metacognition. I offer you just a hypothesis. I'm not a neuroscientist, probably make a fool of myself. But we act deliberately because of our metacognitive processes, we form plans and intentions. If you don't metacognize a sensory experience, you are not going to form intentions around it. In other words, you're not going to form the intention to read the words in a book from left to right. And therefore, none of those blind sight type experiences will be sophisticated because you can't form metacognitive intentions around them. Yeah, but look, but you can perfectly well, so you don't have blind sight, I assume. And if I do this right in front of you, you're going to flinch or your pupil, you know, it's a it's a reflex and you'll perfectly well see it. It'll take you time to see it. In fact, you can show by the time you've seen it, you've already initiated the reflex, but you will see it. So blind sight is only in these patients. It's a very rare phenomenon. It's not very common. And in patients who have lost pieces of the brain, typically in visual cortex. So you and I, you will, you know, if there's an empty screen as a bright dot, you take a blind sight person that has lost V1 and then they claim no, they don't see anything yet. They can still point at it. I don't think it requires something very sophisticated. I think it's just it's a simple visual computation. In this case, it is a computation that doesn't give rise to neural correlate of consciousness. But there is blind sight, even if you have lost V1. Well, that's where it was first reported. It was first reported in it. First, it came out of the annual literature, particularly in monkey, when they remove primary visual cortex, sometimes including higher order, there's a famous monkey called Helen. And there's this video of Helen. This experiment was done by Larry Weisskine's, where you put raisins in front of her. And although she has no primary visual cortex, so for the audience, that's a that's a bit that the visual cortex is the back of your head. Here you can feel, you know, there's this little bump here. That's where visual cortex is. So if you fall backwards, typically you see stars because the mechanical stimulus is translated into nervous energy. So if you remove that in these monkeys, what was so striking that these monkeys could still catch little raisins, you know, it, it looked like they could see perfectly well, but their visual cortex that had been removed, how's that possible? That's how the blind sight was discovered. Because then it was tested in some patients who to say, I don't see anything yet, they can do simple types of visual behavior. As I said, they can't read, but they can do pointing, they can do some color discrimination, etc. So the general assumption is, it involves neurons in the retina that don't go to call to the LGN and cortex, because that part is destroyed, but go to, to, to centers in the brainstem that can mediate things like reflexes or pointing like the coliculus where things are, but they're not associated with consciousness. They do not, they do not provide a substrate for conscious experience. As an idealist, of course, I'm committed to the notion that however it works, it's an experiential process of course, but I'm open to the possibility that it's not an experiential process that is subsumed in the main complex, which I think is what you're trying to say. It's not part of the ego. It's not part of our personal experiential life. It's something off to the side. I'm open to that. Yeah. Yeah. In fact, this might explain all sorts of unconscious, you know, what people explain with the Freudian unconsciousness, that they're, as you said before, dissociation in normal people, like you and I. So there could well be the footprints of my, what I teach calls a complex that includes most of my, my cortex, including Borca's area. So I can talk to you. That's my egodic consciousness. There may still be smaller complexes, let's say in the frontal, inferior frontal or in the back of it, that can, that can possibly control, you know, that get visual input and do stuff that allows me to rapidly run and weave my way through a very busy street. I was sharp as yet the egodic consciousness isn't conscious of it, but it may well be there's this little substrate. The Freudian slips, right? Exactly. So in this case, it wouldn't be unconscious. There would be consciousness, but not the one, the one that controls your Borca's area that you can ask to what, why did you just say that conscious literally might not have no idea. I don't know. I just said it. I have no idea why, because and again, you see this in split brain early on, when you can get this, what's called intermanual conflict. So once you do this, you cut the brain in two in these patients, you can see that typically, for example, a patient will close his shirt with one hand and the other hand will open it, or you get the alien hand syndrome, where the hand will suddenly do something like grab their legs or grab their genitals, and the patient himself completely confuses, I don't know, my hand does this. And the question is, why does it do it? Is it because it's, it also has this consciousness, but not them, but its footprint is not the main one, the egodic consciousness. It's a very interesting hypothesis worth pursuing. Yep. The IIT and Association, that's, that's the future if you ask me. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I've been waiting for a while. Yeah. Shall we move on to another one? Prakash, did you have any more questions to follow up? I want to thank both of them for this very in depth discussion. The only, the only, you know, the thing that I'm pointing out is not to mix the science and metaphysics, but in terms of inquiry, is there a place of convergence where people from these different thought worlds can merge, you know, well, like we have done in this particular group, we've done this. Yeah, we're doing it now, Prakash. Yeah. Yes, I'm just wondering if a physical location might be something like a future university, you know. Yeah, once, for instance, there's a Tibet emery in Science Encounter organized by a party was together with this holiness, the Dalai Lama, I've been there, and I've gone to, to Mungot in India several times where you have Tibetan monasteries, where, where at least you're trying to precisely do this sort of take Western science, typically physics, and neuroscience psychology, and bring it to the monastic community, where each, where each of those two very different traditions and communities can bring, can learn from each other. So I know that there are initiatives like that. Thank you. Thank you. As you guys have already mentioned that our experiment you're being performed. Let's do interesting states. One is general anesthesia. And those cases who were patients who are almost in the dead bed, who were about to die, but somehow happens to be brain dead, and somehow resuscitates facts, and then reports, which we call the NDE. But anyway, so my question is this, both of you see some prospects, which, when I say data means hard data, challenges the conventional understanding in the neuroscience, which exists today, which challenges it. So do you guys see that, do you guys feel that more such experiments are required to take place? And if so, do you guys see maybe currently which is there, or maybe in the future, we can find some more hard data regarding which can challenge the existing conventional understanding of consciousness? All right, near death experience. So that's a very difficult question. So in fact, when I visited Bernardo a couple of months ago, he took me and introduced me to Von Lommel, the Dutch cardiologist, who published this famous study of near death experiences in cardiac, a prospective study in cardiac patients in Holland and reported that 10 up to 15% of these people had near death experiences. So I think, so at least in Bernardo, I know we differ here, and then let me give my position and then over to you. So there's the interesting psychological phenomenon of near death experiences, which is very powerful, which is highly reproducible, and people are taking serious, in a sense, it's being studied by many people, psychologists, neuroscientists, where you know, you lose your sense of self, you lose your body. In my case, I had one of these, there was nothing there, just light. So typically, people report either this lucidity or this very, very icy blue, blue, bright or light of overwhelming intensity, and then some combination of terror or ecstasy or certain other experiences. So they're now conferences organized, book being written about NDE, where it gets, so that used to be very controversial, and the only place where you could find these stories in the bookstore was under Isotirica, you know, way in the back of the bookstore, where they have stuff on a magic and witchcraft, you can find stories on NDE. That's changed, that's now mainstream. What remains highly, highly controversial is the claim, and it's very difficult to really test rigorously, and I'll tell you why. What's the brain doing this experience? What's the brain actually dead? So a death is a complicated matter now, you know, it used to be very easy. You were dead when your brain stopped, when you stopped breathing and your heart stopped beating, but now with resuscitation tools and with extracorporeal, you know, heart lung, it becomes much more difficult to define what death is and how you define it, and typically one way to define it would be isoelectric EEG, but of course in the vast number of cases in the ICU where these people with cardiac arrest are treated, you don't have a high density EEG, and you don't have the luxury to put on a high density EEG while the patient is cold blue, right, or cold red, right, because the heart stopped, because every seconds count, so you're not going to put electrode on them. So that claim, so on the one hand there are people like Von Lommel who really says the brain was dead, i.e. in this case functionally inactive, no more electrical activity, no more electrical activity, really flat line, what's called when the EEG is flat line. I find that, I just find that impossible to accept having studied the brain for 40 years and knowing the close relationship between electrical activity and different brain states, like sleep, like dreaming, like regular, we can see it in babies, in newborns, in disease, etc. I find that very, very difficult to accept, but there are persons now over to Bernardo, including Von Lommel, who really insist people can have these experiences while their brain is totally inactive. Bernardo. Yeah, I think Ben Von Lommel's study on the Lansent in 2001 was methodologically strong. I take it seriously, I take MD years seriously, for instance, I think even Alexander, even Alexander III, Anita Morjani and others are truthfully reporting what they experienced. Observe, however, that neither Morjani nor Eben were flat line during their NDEs. The claim there is that the experiential complexity, the structural complexity of their experiences was incompatible with anatomical damage and vastly diminished metabolism or disrupted metabolism. For me, it's not so important whether NDEs flat out contradict physicalism or not, because there was an experience that happened when you could not have had any brain activity whatsoever. For me, this is highly unimportant, because I think we don't need it to contradict physicalism. I think physicalism is a non-starter. We are giving it too much if we acknowledge that we need to prove that in order to prove physicalism false. I think it is inevitable that experience never ends. The question is, is that an experience that correlates with ego itself? Can there be an egoic self-experience when there is zero metabolism? Maybe not. Maybe yes. Either way, I'm happy my analytic idealist stance. What I don't think, and here is where I depart from my friends in the NDE world, and Christoph and I discussed this at length, there is a lot of emphasis in the NDE community on so-called veridical experiences. Things that you saw that were not correlated with the physical location of your body, and you couldn't have seen them because your eyes were shut and you had no brain activity or whatever. I don't think what's happening is that we have some kind of gaseous soul that inhabits the body, and then when you have an NDE, the soul sort of leaves the body and goes floating around and can still see and hear and taste and smell. I don't think that is plausible, otherwise nature would be highly redundant. Why did we have to struggle through life and death for four billion years to evolve the sense organs we have if by stopping our heart we can float around seeing and hearing and sensing everything? I don't think that is plausible, yet I do take the veridical reports seriously. I just think that we need a more nuanced way to try to account for them as opposed to just appealing to the simple face value account that I don't think is plausible at all, which is we can see without eyes. I can't pass that through my head, no. That's a claim on the chat saying that some people say during that MDA people actually remember their afterlife as in like previous, previous life. Is there such a case in your data, Dr. Professor Ko? I've never seen convincing evidence of that. I mean, I know people claim that, but I personally am very skeptical. Sceptical about it. Last interview we had with Bernardo and Lee Long and Bernard Carr. Apparently Dalai Lama has actually do a lot of reading on the brainwave or something like that during somebody's death. He's interested in your sign specifically, yes. So you don't think that those kind of data are reliable at all? I don't know. I mean, I know people claim, but people claim all sorts of things that obviously didn't happen. I just don't know how that would work. So I just had a discussion, in fact, in India, in Mungot, with the Sholina Sadali Lama, and we were talking about reincarnation, and I said, and permit me, I'm just a naive physical, at the time I was a naive physicalist. I said, well, forwards, no brain, never mind. So in other words, there has to be some sort of substrate, some sort of substrate. It may be something very strange, very unconventional, quantum, nano, whatever you want. But without a substrate, I don't see, so this is at least a substrate that can be manipulated, and that can be operationalized using measure like transition probability. In the absence of anything like that, I don't see how mine could occur. So I don't see how previous life, where would their memory be stored, as it were? I remain unconvinced. I don't know whether you want to say something, Bernardo. Yeah, I do. We shouldn't agree on everything here today. I'll try to disagree. Look, I was talking about Ibn's NDE, Ibn Alexander. He was not flatlined. His claim is that the state, the anatomical and physiological state of his nervous system was not compatible with the richness, sophistication, and intensity of the experiences he had. I take that seriously. I think that is a plausible statement to make. How would I account for that? Well, I think no more metabolism is the image not only of our internal experiential states, but also the dissociation mechanism itself, this actively enforced dissociation mechanism. So certain metabolic conditions, some impairments of metabolism are probably the appearance of an impairment of that dissociative boundary itself. So I think it is plausible that in those states in which your dissociative boundary, normally actively enforced, is impaired, that you will pick up on experiential states in your cognitive neighborhood that do not correlate with the way you appear on the dashboard. In other words, do not correlate with the body form, with metabolism and anatomy. Because I think of the body as an image of experiential states, as opposed to the cause of experiential states. I'm open to the possibility that the image is incomplete. It doesn't say everything there is to say about the experiential states it correlates with. For instance, I, from your perspective, I am an image on your computer screen. The pixels on your computer screen arrange themselves in such a way as to correlate with my inner life. Because I'm speaking, I'm expressing my inner life, and it appears as a representation on your screen. But that representation doesn't say everything there is to say about my inner life. It is an incomplete image. So I take it seriously that the body can be also an incomplete image. It may not correlate with everything there is to correlate when it comes to memories, or when it comes to certain experiential states that we call transcendent or transformative. Those may have to do with dissociative boundary that becomes porous. And you're just trafficking with the cognitive surroundings around you. And those will not correlate with your body form. So I think evens claim is plausible. Anita's claim is plausible. But when it comes to reincarnation, at least in the cartoonish form that we tend to explain it, which is that your personal agency somehow survives the complete dissipation of the image that in all other cases correlates with it, and somehow enters or associates itself with another body, I think this isn't plausible. Because our personal agency correlates extraordinarily well with the body image. If the body image is not there, I think we should grant that at least a lot if not the complete personal agency is no longer the case. So I don't think our personal agency hops from body to body. Otherwise, I would expect children to already be born knowing everything they knew in the previous life. And then people say, well, we forget things. Yes, but there are certain things, you know, do we forget riding a bike or swimming? And I don't know, I don't see a coherent way to account for the hypothesis of the survival of personal agency. So I don't think it happens. But what people report and we interpret as reincarnation, what they actually report is someone else's memories. Could they be somehow finding a cognitive path across a dissociative boundary and link to a memory state that is out there in our cognitive neighborhood, because its previous owner has died, it doesn't have a dissociative boundary anymore. So its memories are released out there and they get picked up by new emerging dissociative processes. Perhaps I think that is plausible and it will remain plausible until and unless we find exactly what in the physical world correlates to memories, not to the recall of memories, but to memories as a repository of information. And seeing the work that has been done recently, we are not getting closer to it. We seem to be all over the place. So until and unless we pin that down, I think it is plausible that experiential states corresponding to a dead person's memories get picked up by a newly emerging dissociated complex in this field of subjectivity that nature is. So if we let's say we take Michael Levin's bioelectrical signal, so how do that's bioelectric signal carrying memory then? Because there all seems to have a memory that would still be physical. Yeah, it would still be physical. It's a field, an electric field, you can measure it at a particular frequency. So that still requires a physical substrate. My point is simply in the absence of any such a physical substrate, I don't see how you could preserve memory or agency or anything else. And to encode rich information in a field, you need some form of modulation signaling some stuff that we would be able to read out and see and say, okay, that's the information, that's where it's coming from, we can see it in the behavior of the field. And what Michael sees, he's not trying to account for reincarnation. So let's start from that. What he realizes is that the body plan is related to bioelectric fields. And you can coax a cancer cell back to the body plan by manipulating the bioelectric field. I think this is... Intranaria. No, no, in frogs. Frogs. And in frogs and in salamander. Yeah. Yeah. Not yet in mammals. Yeah, no, it's cool stuff. It is. It is. It's interesting stuff. Yeah, no question. So basically, what I want to say is that like, you know, you should not bring back the materialism from the back end, saying that there's a substrate. What we can instead say everything is abstract, you know, because the numbers, for example, are abstract, software programs are abstract. We all understand that they're not anywhere, but they're accessible to us because there is a structure and so on. Now, the point is like, you know, that how it is proven is that when we see something, it's actually in the visual cortex where they know life. And yet we have all the perception, which is happening right now, which obviously means like, you know, that it's only because of nervous signals, if the perception is happening. But nervous signals have nothing in them to cause the so-called perception because the signals are signals. They're just moving around. It's electricity moving around. So the perceptive field is a totally independent of the abstract realities, because now rest of the reality, now we have to say abstract because the perception is connected to the abstract realities. Now, if you take this viewpoint, then body is just a cache of information, like a computer. And it's not even physical. It's just an abstract boundary. It has an abstract boundaries. And it's doing all the manipulation. So in this viewpoint, all the inconsistencies of the theories are stored is what I feel. But only thing you have to admit is that the so-called senses are not physical in nature. They are like the standalone. They're a different category by themselves. They're not physical in nature. They're not objects in nature. And then the so-called awareness, which is what we feel is having access to infinite amount of memory. But when it is actually practical, it's only having boundaries of information. Like our body is a boundary. When we study computer science, it's a boundary of information. And by creating a boundary, we are able to work in a consistent manner because without a boundary, there cannot be consistency in the reality. And the consciousness, one of the property of consciousness is to manipulate the boundaries of information. That's why we are able to say that, like, you know, we are talking to each other in clubhouse, that's a boundary. And we can now increase and say, okay, I'm in the physical reality, and so on and so on. Because no physical system can manage its own knowledge boundary, not even the LLMs, right? It's only the awareness or consciousness, which changes the knowledge boundaries, which it manipulates, which it then superimpose on the body. And then it translates into nervous signals, which then do the all the work, which is all just a layered system, the way we do the layering of the information in the computer. I feel this is how it has to be adopted, because it's actually Vedantic view, what I'm telling is kind of Vedantic view. Do you have a questions, Vinod, to Professor Cole? I'm saying that we should not bring materialism in any way when we are talking about the models of reality is what my point is. Thank you. Is it acceptable or what is? Accepting, at least, I mean, manipulating known mechanisms that we see, whether it's in the brain, or in the outside world, in geology, or in physics, or in solid state physics, or in quantum mechanics has been enormously as successful. If we want techniques that in a lawful way manipulate our environment, and then use them to build technology, accepting that they are mechanisms has been incredible useful. That has been the right time of science for better words. And I see no reason we can't, we can't continue to do that. We just should deemphasize whether there truly exist in some absolute sense and whether there's something ultimately underneath that. But science, all of science and the modern way of life is conditioned on manipulating mechanisms in a particular state. And that works, whether that's brains, or whether that's nuclear reactors, it works exceedingly well. I mean, the mRNA COVID has given out a proof of that that rational understanding of mechanisms really gave rise to this, to this highly, you know, protective medicine. And that's what science can do. Just in defense of that. Simple question. If we move our hand, what really is the mechanism at place? Where is the starting point of movement of hands? That's what I'm asking is the problem is not about how to move reality, how to change reality. What is the source of change of reality? Yeah, so IIT has a very precise answer to that. Ultimately, it totally agrees with your intuition. It's not the neurons that move my hand. It's not the muscles that move my hand, but it's ultimately the intrinsic causal power of my conscious experience to make a point. And then to make that point, I raise my left hand or raise my right hand. So the conventional explanation is it's my premotor cortex that gave rise to the readiness potential and libid experiments and all of that. But within IIT says, no, it's not the underlying neurons that cause it. It's my conscious experience that was the ultimate cause that however that does correlate with certain brain phenomena. But then as we always teach our students correlation is not causation. So just because you can read off a brain signal a second before you actually make the movement doesn't mean that this brain signal is the actual cause of it. So I would tend to agree with your point of view. Yeah, of course, I agree too. I think where the confusion comes, it's more a psychodynamic whole thing. When we understood back in the early 17th century that two perspectives were very useful and conducive to the production of knowledge and understanding nature, those perspectives were realism and naturalism. When we understood that realism and naturalism came back under the metaphysics of physicalism. But that was just the one example of naturalism and realism that we had. Naturalism and realism are not intrinsically associated with physicalism. You can abandon physicalism without having to abandon realism and naturalism. In other words, without having to abandon the notion that there is a world out there made of states that are outside my personal agency and which I cannot control or change merely by an act of volition. And those states obey certain regularities, certain natural regularities such as expressed in the chains of causation. Those states do not do what they do because there is an entity outside nature that is intervening into nature all the time and making things move around, moving the planets around the orbit of the sun like the flying spaghetti monster with its noodley appendages. That's what we deny. We deny that there is deliberate intervention to explain the dynamics of nature. We say under naturalism that nature does what it does because it is what it is. And to be is to have properties and because nature has the properties it has, it behaves in the way it does. That's naturalism and there is a world out there that's realism. We can preserve both while discarding physicalism which makes an extra claim which is that the external states of the world out there are not experiential fundamentally and it is only the arrangement of those states that in certain circumstances generate experience as something epiphenomenal and they don't have an account for how that miracle could possibly happen. So we reject that but in doing it we do not need to reject naturalism and realism. Or just talk about the nervous system as it relates to IIT. All right, nervous system relates to IIT. I think it means the rest of the peripheral nervous system below the brain stem. I think that's the question. Does it correlate with experiential states, the rest of the nervous system? Yeah. Okay, so the brain conventionally is sort of the central nervous system but as Bernardo said there's of course a peripheral nervous system that goes all the way into almost all that innervates our muscles of course but that also innervates our heart, our kidneys, our liver, our gut, our sexual organs. So all of that and it's bi-directional. It goes the information travels from the periphery from these organs into the brain and from the brain back into the organ and so but the actual substrate of consciousness is probably in the upper part in the upper echelon at least in normal people who grew up with a normal brain it's probably in cortex. It doesn't include the PNS, the peripheral nervous system. However, you can perfectly well be aware of these states of the peripheral nervous system. You can feel hungry, you can feel you know when you have a full belly, you can feel you know when you need to go to the bathroom, you can feel if you're training yourself and pay attention you can be sensitive to your heartbeat right and snipers can learn to do that so you can perfectly well become aware of these states and furthermore what what the placebo and the nocebo response shows that that your narrative, your belief can reach out all the way what you believe in your mind about something some procedure or some ceremony or some person can reach all the way back using those those axons but now going backwards into the organs and can influence your immune system, can influence your gut right in psychology this is also called the somatization when people have various symptoms but they show up in various parts of their of their body so it's really a two-way communication and and what we've learned over the last hundred years there can be this profound influence on your belief since ultimately that's what's known as a placebo or the it's dark twin the nocebo response that's exactly what it shows when you believe that a particular piece of pill subscribed to you by somebody who spent 10 years at a medical school it's called doctor in a white lab coat and you've read all about those other people who with that same pill have these wonderful experiences then you too will believe and then you too are much more likely to have such an experience or to have an amelioration of your symptoms so this shows prime sort of mind over matter so I think it's a very important lessons to take home and it all requires the two-way communication that is the peripheral nervous system thank you hey guys so I was listening to you know the arguments against personal agency and reincarnation and my question is if the argument is made as the personal agency having the body and not the body having the personal agency do you see do you see that there is a change of standpoint that you are having and a follow-up question can be you know even in certain idealist philosophies like Mahayana Buddhism that personal agency is considered to be part of physicalism so do you see that possibility as well in your arguments I mean I don't see how without I mean once again without a substrate without that being some substrate I don't see how personal memories or personal agency can can be we need some substrate without that I don't see how that would happen and if for sophisticated minds like yours and mine you need a very sophisticated substrate that that potentially can adopt many many many different states in the absence of that I don't see you know nothing nothing comes talking from principle I'm a little bit less strict than Christoph because of this view I have that images do not need to be complete the hypothesis is not incoherent in principle there could be a hierarchy of dissociation in nature such that higher level dissociative process that you call then the personal agency would further dissociate into what appears to us as a physical body and when that under that that's a lower level of dissociation comes to an end and the physical body then dissolves because it's the image of that process that is no longer going on you sort of fall back into that higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy and there is still something individuated there that's the hypothesis is it in principle incoherent no does it have empirical backing no and you could say well the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence so there could still be this higher level of dissociation that preserves individual agency yes but isn't it quite forced because a lot about the body correlates with our inner mental states so what we are requiring here is that although there is this enormous vast correlation between body and our mental states which we consider individual when it comes to this higher level of dissociation in the hierarchy it doesn't appear at all on the dashboard it has no physical correlate or in the words of Christoph it has no substrate that I think stretches plausibility too much I am open to the idea in principle but I don't think we have sufficient reasons to entertain it quite seriously at this point quickly because yeah it is for professor Christoph and it was regarding that famous bet which you had with David Chalmers so I just wanted to know or it was more of a lighter note but like did you change your quote-unquote position after post that bet or and if you're not so like why a more serious note like what do you see like David Chalmers one and you don't see both IIT and I think a GWT both is not able to answer the question which has been you know the hard problem of consciousness that would be my quick question no so this bet was not about the hard problem it was about the easy problem the bet was in 25 years from 2098 will the community of scientists that study conscience agree it's these mechanisms in that part of the brain that are the substrate of consciousness and no as of last year the community has not agreed on that but he agrees I mean David Chalmers agrees it's a perfectly solvable problem and sooner or later we won't know the answer sooner or later we know that these mechanisms in that state give rise to pain or to pleasure or to seeing and and to reading there's no question about it it's an entirely operational empirical defined defined project and it does not suffer from the hard problem because it's just correlation this part of the brain or these neurons doing this thing correlate with that conscious experience massive thank you for both of you for joining us today thank you so much thank you to see you take care yeah see you all again take care take care see you next Friday
