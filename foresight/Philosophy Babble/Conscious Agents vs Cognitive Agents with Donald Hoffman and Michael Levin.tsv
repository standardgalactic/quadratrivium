0	7360	The view in our cognitive scientists today is that we construct our perceptions of reality
7360	14680	in real time. The question was, could we be misinterpreting the content of our perceptual
14680	23080	experiences? And what is our current understanding in a biology of science? According to evolution,
23080	29880	what we perceive with our brain and our senses does not reflect the true natures of the reality.
30080	36640	Why should you care? The implications of such radical finding rock the foundations of our
36640	44440	belief system that space-time is fundamental. In this series, we are delighted to have Professor
44440	50880	Meredith O'Carnative Science, Donald Hoffman, and Professor of Developmental and Synthetic
50880	57320	Biology, Michael Levin joining us today to discuss the idea, and we are going to look
57640	63880	at what is a contest agency. Welcome, Professor Levin. Welcome, Professor Hoffman.
64920	67880	Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for having us. Absolutely.
70360	74360	How's the new year treating both professors so far? Did you all have a good holiday?
76600	82520	Yeah, sure. Yes, healthy and uneventful, which is good. Yeah, nothing to complain about.
83480	88840	So, any new project for 2023?
90520	99320	Many things. So, in our lab, we have a variety of kind of conceptual and computational projects
99320	105400	and also a bunch of bench work and stuff. So, we have lots of things going on in the areas of,
105400	111240	well, the practicalities come out as cancer, birth defects, regenerative medicine, those kinds of
111240	119560	things. It is our desire to understand collective intelligence, which I think is all intelligence,
119560	128360	and how it is that minds are sort of emerge in the physical world. And so, we are finding new
128360	134680	ways to try to communicate with cellular swarms in the body as a kind of collective intelligence.
134680	140520	And we've got some interesting things on looking at the different competencies of things like
140520	146520	gene regulatory networks, in addition to other models like slime molds and things. So,
146520	149240	yeah, lots of new stuff along those lines.
151000	153560	Busy is going to keep you busy. And Don, you?
154680	163160	That's quite a list. That's an impressive list. Well, we're focused on a number of projects,
163160	171640	but most interesting to me is the physicists tell us that space time is doomed. And they're
171640	175160	not just saying that they're finding new structures beyond space time, right? They're
175160	179720	actually finding these structures like the Amplituhedron and the deepest structure or something
179720	186040	called decorated permutations. But these are just like static structures beyond space time.
186040	194360	We've been looking for a dynamics beyond space time, dynamical system that would actually give
194360	200600	rise to these structures, like the deepest structure is the decorated permutation. So,
200600	208920	we just published a paper last week in which we did that. So, we prove that it's apparently a new
208920	215640	mathematical result that you can canonically map Markov chains, any Markov chain to decorated
215640	224680	permutations. And so, that gives us a window now to start to interpret these structures beyond
224680	229240	space time in terms of Markovian dynamics. And so, that's what we're doing now. So, we have
231000	237880	the project I'm working on now is to show we have a Markovian dynamics of conscious agents.
237880	242120	That's what made us look after these Markov chain ideas and see if we could, you know,
242120	246360	turn them into decorated permutations. That was the motivation because we already have a Markovian
246360	252360	dynamics of consciousness. And so, that's what we're up to now is, okay, now that we have this map
252360	258520	of our conscious agent dynamics, so as a model of conscious agents beyond space time into decorated
258520	267640	permutations, that now should instruct us exactly how to port specific properties of the conscious
267640	272920	agent dynamics to specific physical properties like mass, momentum, spin, and energy and so
272920	280840	forth. So, that's what I'm excited to do because that link has told us where exactly to look
280840	285160	in our conscious agent dynamics. And so, we're looking there and we're finding some beautiful
285160	291160	mathematical structures and getting hints about how they project to properties in space time. So,
291160	300360	we're trying to, so that's my project to map that out and then make explicit proposals for how
301240	308120	could be tested with the data on the inner structure of protons. So, the scattering
309400	314040	experiments that have been done since the 1960s at Stanford Linear Accelerator and then
315480	320680	much more powerful ones later on. We have given us a tremendous amount of detail about the inner
320680	326440	structure, the quark gluon and so forth structure, the parton structure of, and their momentum
326440	332120	distributions inside protons. So, that's my goal this year is to try to actually predict those
332120	337400	distributions from a theory of conscious agents that's beyond space time. That would be, that would
337400	345400	be a good year. On the 20th of December, Professor Levin tweeted, when I was five, I asked my dad
345400	351960	where a certain toy was that I couldn't find. He said, you know how today's clicks over into
351960	358600	tomorrow while you sleep at night? Well, the toy didn't make it. I wouldn't say that's responsible
358600	365480	for my all weird thinking actions, but I spent a long time thinking about how frame of time and
365480	373000	days works. How some object passed from yesterday to today and how that apparently can fail. And
373000	380040	how we as mine say in yesterday, or successfully make it forward. Try to stay up all night to
380040	387320	catch the transactions very disturbing at the time. Professor Levin, could you speak on the toy
387320	395960	that missing? Yeah, I remember it quite clearly. It was a, it was a, it was some sort of plastic
395960	401400	gun or something like this. And, and I remember my, my, I couldn't find it anywhere. And I'm sure,
401400	405560	I'm sure probably somebody threw it away. And my dad, without skipping a beat, he said, he said,
405560	409080	oh yeah, you know, like at night, when things, you know, go over from today to tomorrow, yeah,
409080	413560	it didn't make it. So, you know, that's it. You can give up. It just didn't make it. And I walked
413560	418680	away thinking, oh my God, that's bad. There's a thought like, like, what, well, what determines
418680	422760	whether things make it? And, and, and what if I don't make it? And, and, and what happens? And
422760	427480	then I tried to stay up, of course, all night wanting to catch that, you know, wanting to catch
427480	432200	that moment. When I wasn't, I wasn't able to, I would just fall asleep somewhere around midnight
432200	439160	and like, dang, I missed it again. But you know, so I don't know how much, how much that was responsible
439160	444920	for some of the strange things I think about. But I do, I do think that one of the things that
444920	451400	I've been thinking about recently is this, which I think it relates that is this notion of a lot
451400	455800	of what we do relates to this notion of selfhood or being a self, you know, what does it mean to be
455800	461640	a permanent or, or not, not a permanent, but a stable cognitive structure? Because much like with
461640	466280	bodies, which are a kind of ship of thesis sort of thing, right, molecules come and go all the
466280	471560	time cells come and go all the time. But something stays the same. So what is that? And what are the
471560	476680	policies that the other cells and molecules are implementing that allows some sort of stable,
476680	481880	large scale collective to remain while the low level parts are swapped out at will. And it's not
481960	488040	always a policy to maintain status quo, it might be more metamorphosis, it might be all kinds of
488040	492680	changes that, you know, regeneration and development may, but, but in any case, you need to maintain
492680	499320	some sort of large scale coherence, even though the parts are changing out all the time. So I was
499320	506200	thinking about this with respect to the cognition as well, if you're going to be a stable mind of
506200	513560	some sort, you need to allow ID and go and you need to be in different states. But it, it can't
513560	517240	be something that just completely erases you, you know, every time you have a new thought, well,
517240	522840	that's it, now you're, you know, now you're gone. So, so, so that that balance with the opposite
522840	528840	idea, which comes from many places, but among them, Buddhist ideas of an impermanent self,
528840	534760	or perhaps an illusory, even, even maybe an illusory self. So I've been, I've been thinking about
534840	539480	that a lot and trying to play with these ideas of stability, but, but changeability and the
539480	548680	robustness and yet plasticity. And one way I now think about this is that the self is, it's not
548680	554680	so much that it's completely illusory, but it, but it has to be recreated at every moment in time.
554680	560760	And what I mean by that is just that, at any given moment right now, everything you know about,
560760	565240	or you think you know about yourself, your past, everything else, you have to reconstruct
565240	570440	from the memory traces in your brain. You don't actually have access to anything that really
570440	575880	happened before, whether they be molecules or, or physiological structures, we actually don't
575880	581320	know what it is really. But whatever it is that you've got hold of right now, you have this narrow
582520	588760	slice of now, which is, I don't know, a couple of hundred milliseconds, maybe, and that's your
588760	593720	self. And then you sort of have to reconstruct everything you think you know, from whatever
593720	598040	memory molecules or, you know, engrams that you find laying around in your, in your brain. That's
598040	602920	your only, and of course, people have played with this, you know, for these sort of, I think,
602920	607240	I think maybe humor, somebody said, you know, or, or Boltzmann brains, you know, this idea that
607240	611480	all your memories could have been created and the really hadn't been, and I don't mean, I don't mean
611480	617480	this, this, this sort of bizarre sceptical thing that can't be disproven. I just mean literally
617480	624120	that at every moment, as a cognitive agent, you have to be constructing a model of yourself from
624120	627960	the evidence that you have, which and where does it come from? Well, whatever engrams happen to be
627960	634920	in your, in your, in your brain. And so this, you know, you can imagine yourself as these like
634920	639720	slices in this, in this, you know, and I'm sure I'm sure this is, you know, as Don was saying,
639720	644120	this probably an outdated view already, but I sort of imagine it as these slices of this, of this
644120	650520	giant space time loaf, so to speak. And each, and each one you're basically, you have to recreate
650520	658040	yourself from scratch. And, and then, and if, and that way, what happens is that you can think of
658040	661400	everything you've done in the past and all the memories that were formed in the past,
663080	668200	patients from a past self to a future self, and everything you're doing now are messages that
668200	673320	you are in fact leaving for your future self in a way, right? Because so the memories that you're
673320	677080	forming now and the things you're doing now are things that some future version of you is going
677080	681880	to be using those to base their model of what the heck is going on and when, and who am I? And,
681880	686280	and of course, there are medical versions of this. So people with anterior grade amnesia,
686280	691080	who can't form new memories, what do they do? They, they, they leave, right? So, so, so you
691080	694920	wake up in the morning, because there's this notepad. And on the notepad, first thing it says is,
694920	699000	Hey, by the way, you've got anterior grade amnesia. This is who you are. And this is what's going on.
699000	705320	And the last thing is, don't forget to, don't forget to write. And so we all do this all the
705320	709320	time. It's just that typically our pads are internal. So that, right? So that's all that is
710120	714040	really the same problem, because you must reconstruct yourself. It's just on a smaller
714040	718680	scale. And, and it's somehow internal. So anyway, that's, that's my, my ramblings on that. That,
718680	726360	that's how I've been thinking about this. Thank you. Don, what did you think the time is then?
726920	732520	Is it a, is it a, you know, space and time? Is it more like a data structure?
733480	740280	Could you speak on that, please? Great question. I'll just say one thing along the lines of what
740280	745880	Mike was saying. I agree with what you're saying, Mike. And it's, and it's quite interesting,
745880	751240	because every time you access those memories, you destroy them. You have to do memory reconciled.
751240	756760	You have to actually rebuild the memories all the time as well. So, so you're rebuilding yourself
756760	760440	all the time. It's not like the memory is there and it's always there. You know, every time you
760440	765720	access it, you have to rebuild it. So that's distracting. And yeah, the framework in which
765720	770520	you're talking like, you know, the space time loaf is, has been the standard, your physicalist
770520	777480	framework, you know, since, since Einstein for, so for over a century now. And, but it's interesting
777480	781880	how the physicists realized that, that, that space time itself isn't, is not fundamental.
781880	787480	And so, so it doesn't mean that those ideas are wrong. It means that that way of thinking about
787480	792520	them will have to be understood at a deeper level, right? We'll have to have a deeper representation
792520	799240	beyond space time and that, you know, of physics or whatever beyond space time that projects down
799240	804360	to the space time loaf and projects down to the processes we see, like memory, reconciliation,
804440	810840	and so forth, the middle processes. So those, so, so the space and time are not fundamental,
810840	815960	you know, then, and the physicists are, the physicists are the ones who are not me. It's
815960	822680	the physicists that are saying space time is doomed. It, their own theories. So quantum field
822680	829080	theory and general relativity together are very clear that it's a data structure that works down
829080	835560	to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and then falls apart. So it's actually a really shallow
835560	840040	data structure. It's 10 to the minus 33, not 10 to the minus 33 trillion,
840040	847160	just 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, the thing falls apart. And so, so that means that, by the
847160	855560	way, time also falls apart at 10 to the minus 43 seconds. So, so I take the physicists up their
855560	862200	word that space time is doomed. And that that means that time is doomed. Right. So your question
862200	871240	was about time. So, so we, and that also, by the way, means that ultimately, the strategy in science
871240	881640	of that, if you go to smaller and smaller scales of space time, you find more and more fundamental
881720	887080	objects and more and more fundamental laws. That's the reductionism. That's precisely the
887080	894360	reductionism I mean. That reductionism is false. It just doesn't work beyond 10 to the minus 33
894360	900520	centimeters. And in fact, it falls apart well before them. You get these UVIR correspondences
900520	911800	that will things up well before that. So, so I think that time is and space are merely interface
911800	919080	concepts that they're, they're what we use to get by in, but they're not the reality and the,
919080	924840	and the reality is something entirely outside space and time. And I'll just mention that our
924840	930600	work in evolution of a natural selection agrees with, with the physicists. Evolution also entails
930600	936120	that space and time and objects in space and time are not fundamental. So, so that means that
936120	941640	neurons don't exist when they're not perceived, but, but, but that is not to put down neurobiology.
942520	947160	In fact, what I say is we need more money for neurobiology because we realize it's a lot harder
947160	951400	than we ever thought. We thought, you know, there's 86 billion neurons in the brain and,
951400	956120	you know, that's a hard problem, but, but that's just the interface representation. That's, that's
956120	962120	the dumb down version. The real complex version is being hidden from us. And we have to really reverse
962120	967320	engineer neurobiology and space time to something deeper. It's going to be far more complicated
967320	971960	and we'll have to see how it projects down to space time. So, so I think that, that time is,
971960	976680	is not fundamental. And in our Markovian dynamics of conscious agents,
977640	984520	there is no entropic arrow of time necessary in the dynamics. So, we can have a dynamics in which
984520	991080	there is a sequence parameter, but there is the entropy does not increase. But it turns out it's
991080	999240	a theorem that if you take a projection of the dynamics on by say conditional probability,
999240	1004280	that any projected view of the dynamics, you'll get a new dynamics that's a, you know, projection
1004280	1009160	of the bigger dynamics of the fundamental dynamic, that new dynamics will have an arrow of time.
1011160	1014920	Just because of the loss of information that happened in the projection process.
1015640	1023480	So, so that makes sense. Space time is just our virtual reality headset. It's a projection. It loses
1023480	1030360	information. We have an arrow of time because of that loss of information. In other words, time
1031080	1037720	is not an insight into the nature of reality. It's just an artifact of the projection process,
1037720	1043880	purely an artifact and not an, not an insight. There's more to say, but I'll stop there because
1043880	1050680	I don't want to do it. Mike, do you agree? Or you have anything to add to that, Mike?
1050680	1055960	Yeah. Well, I think, I think it's a, it's a, it's a very profound idea. And, and I think that
1056920	1065000	I, I wonder if we can generalize that to say that it's almost, it's almost guaranteed that
1066200	1076440	agents will, will build models of their world that may or may not agree with other agents
1076440	1083800	models of their world, because as Don has very nicely shown rigorously, evolution isn't looking
1083880	1090360	for that. It's just looking for expedient representations. And so it's entirely possible
1090360	1094600	that there are, I mean, so, so Chris Fields and I work on this kind of stuff a lot from the perspective
1094600	1101160	of observers and this idea that everything is some observer's vantage point description.
1101720	1106440	And so I think it makes complete sense to me that from certain vantage points,
1107400	1111160	things look like there's, there's space and time, but you know, it's like, it's like,
1111160	1114840	we have mathematical tools, you know, neural nets and things like that, that will
1114840	1120280	take, take their experience and project it into some crazy space where you can't make heads of
1120280	1124760	tails of what the principal components are. And, and, and because, and this is what happens to,
1124760	1129160	to us all, we make, we make some kind of representation that seems to be good enough
1129160	1134280	for survival and various other things. But, but none of that should be taken as, as, as,
1134280	1139400	as fundamental. And the other, the other thing that this is maybe stepping away a little bit,
1139480	1145640	but, but I think it bears on this, on this topic as far as, you know, space, space and time have
1145640	1151160	served well, they've in physics, right, they've done a nice job and everything. But I think,
1151160	1155240	I think we have to ask somebody, somebody once said, I remember who it was that them,
1156360	1160520	if you show me the fishing net that you're using, I'll show you the fish you're going to catch,
1160520	1165480	which is that we have to think about what are these tools good for and what are they not good for.
1165560	1169960	And one of the things that I've been increasingly sort of focusing on this, this idea that
1171080	1178760	the world looks like a mechanical, mechanistic place when you use tools that are low agency
1178760	1184760	tools. So when you use voltmeters and rulers and things like this, all you're ever going to see
1184760	1188920	is low agency stuff, you're going to see things that look like mechanism. Of course,
1188920	1192040	it's going to look like mechanism because that's the, that's the lens you're using.
1192600	1197480	And so we can't then assume that, well, that must be right. And just assume that, okay,
1197480	1202280	it's all got to be bottom up because those are the tools that we use. And what if, what if
1203240	1209240	the things you're going to find have to be in some impedance match, almost are
1210840	1216520	the tools that you're using. And so we suppose you're looking for things like agents or you're
1216520	1221640	looking for virtual governors or top-down controllers, you're not going to find that
1222200	1227320	with low agency tools. What can you find that with? Well, you find it with brains and you find it
1227320	1234760	with minds that are primed to look for agency. These things that are, we don't have a voltmeter
1234760	1244120	that measures causal information, new theory and whatnot. These things that Eric Hall and other
1244120	1249160	folks study these high level, integrated information and all that. You don't have a voltmeter
1249240	1253960	that, of course you don't. But, and so you don't find any of that when you use those tools all you
1253960	1260040	ever see as mechanism. But when you look at the world using a tool, for example, our own mind
1260040	1265800	and our observational system, then we're very good at detecting agency. Of course, we make mistakes
1265800	1271080	in both directions, right? We have false positive and false negatives. But minds are really good
1271080	1277160	tools to find other minds, voltmeters or not. And so, right? So maybe there's something there.
1277160	1281720	Maybe it's this idea that, yes, of course, these things have been with us and they do a nice job
1282280	1286200	on the kinds of things that they're good at, which is describing mechanical,
1286200	1291720	mechanistic interactions. And I think what Don has highlighted very, very effectively is that
1291720	1297560	we cannot assume that, well, that's our fishing net and that's all there is to find. That's clearly,
1297560	1301640	right? They're letting us find certain kinds of things and they're also obscuring lots of other
1301640	1308600	important things. Thank you. So let me summarize it, Don. So you're saying no physical objects,
1308600	1314200	including my body, it's conscious, strictly speaking, right? So my brain isn't conscious
1314200	1321320	because my brain, in fact, doesn't even exist. And then space time is not fundamental. So this
1321320	1326280	standard view that we all took for granted, objective reality we see with our eyes is not
1326920	1337320	surviving bonkers. So having this view with the evolution theory, has it affected your
1337320	1340360	perceptions and your behavior when you come to interacting with the world?
1343080	1349000	Yes. And I think the way you put it is well put. And what Mike has been saying is,
1349960	1357160	I completely agree. And it's brilliant. And the fishing net example is a really good example
1357160	1361480	that, you know, we don't see the world as it is. We see it through the lens of our own concepts and
1361480	1371960	the way we, you know, what we do. And there's no escaping that. And so in effect, as well,
1371960	1377000	as we talked about, you have to recreate yourself all the time, right? That was Mike saying,
1377080	1385800	you're always recreating yourself all the time. Well, you're also recreating the world all the
1385800	1392520	time. So I have a body when I look, and I have neurons when I look. And when I don't look,
1392520	1397960	they're not there. So every time I look. So this is really quite,
1400280	1405400	if you're in a virtual reality game, your avatar is there only when you see it.
1406360	1412040	And the avatar that someone else sees of you is there when they see it. And as soon as they
1412040	1415720	turn their heads somewhere else, that avatar is gone. And they're looking at something else.
1415720	1421880	And so, yeah, we're recreating all the objects inside of space and time on the fly as needed.
1421880	1427160	And that includes all of my neurons and my body. So these things, you know, it's,
1428040	1431480	and we have the illusion that they're there all the time, because every time I look, I see it.
1432120	1436280	But you can get the same illusion in virtual reality, right? You know, if you're playing a
1436280	1439880	good game, you can get immersed in the game. Every time I look over to the right, I see the mountain.
1440760	1444040	So it must mean the mountains there all the time. No, no, you're only rendering the mountain when
1444040	1448440	you look. The fact is, you always render the mountain every time you look that direction,
1448440	1451800	but that doesn't mean the mountain was there. You still have to create it all the time.
1451800	1457240	There is something, there is a reality. But so we get confused, because when we go, well,
1457240	1461080	there must be some reality. Yeah, absolutely, there is a reality. It's just not inside space
1461080	1465560	and time, because it's not inside the virtual reality, because there you have to render everything
1465560	1473640	for it to exist in the only exists in the rendering process. So yes, this has a personal impact,
1474200	1483320	right? I mean, first, when I first realized, I had to just sit down and to absorb it. And that was
1484280	1491560	35 years ago. And I'm still absorbing it. And it's a shock to me. And I think it's a shock to
1491560	1498040	almost everybody, except maybe, you know, advanced meditators and so forth. You know, maybe for them
1498040	1505240	is not as much of a shock, but it's still a shock to the system. And I think Piaget gave us the very
1505240	1512680	famous child psychologist Piaget gave us some insight as to why it's so shocking. And he pointed
1512760	1521080	out that we're programmed to believe in what he called object permanence. He thought we got object
1521080	1527240	permanence by 18 months. Later studies showed that it was probably more like a three or four months.
1527800	1534040	So this is before we're rational, right? We're not reasoning and logically thinking about things.
1534040	1540280	We're just programmed to believe that that doll exists, and will continue to exist,
1540280	1546840	even if it's behind a pillow when I can't see it. Piaget was looking at, you know, babies with
1546840	1550920	dolls. When are they going to go looking for the doll that they can't see? You know, when do they
1550920	1558520	believe the doll still exists? And so we're programmed to, so our belief that the sun exists
1558520	1568120	even when we don't look is not, we didn't come to that belief based on rational, logical, cold
1568120	1575880	logic. We came to it at three months of age because we're programmed to believe that. And so
1577240	1585720	that's why my merely intellectual understanding that it's false has not yet
1587240	1593320	penetrated my emotional work. It's still quite a shock emotionally, absolutely.
1594280	1598760	Mike, has it changed your perceptions of the world?
1599720	1607240	Yeah. Well, I guess what I want to say, two things. One about things that don't change and one
1607240	1616200	about things that do. I once had lunch with a philosopher who was a very strong skeptic on
1616200	1623240	Free Will. And when the waitress came over and said, so, Professor X, what kind of soup will you
1623240	1629960	have? And she said, well, let me think. I said, hey, what are you doing? Why don't you sit back
1629960	1636040	and see what soup gets ordered? What are you doing choosing a soup here? And so that's just
1636040	1639800	to say that. I mean, I understand, of course, the argument and everything. But the point is
1640840	1645240	that's one of those things that you can be a skeptic about Free Will. But I don't think you
1645240	1650360	can live your life. I think it's one of those views that is just impossible to connect with on
1650360	1656440	a practical level for a strong reason that we can talk about. I think actually that and object
1656440	1663160	permanence goes back to the bacterial, microbial level. And so we can talk about that. But I think
1663160	1671320	it is impossible for a coherent mind that evolved under realistic constraints to not believe in
1671320	1675880	being an agent that does things. I think, right, I just don't think you can, no matter what you
1675880	1682520	write about Free Will, I don't think you can live. The thing that I think does change some of these
1682520	1688120	things is this. And this is just a question I'll pose to all of you. And whoever's listening,
1688120	1693080	I think it's an interesting question. I've done a poll of all my friends with this. Imagine, and
1693080	1700360	I think people split into two types of people along this question. Imagine some pleasant
1700440	1706840	experience that you would be willing to pay $100. It's a nice massage or something, whatever it
1706840	1710760	is. It's a nice, it's a nice discreet experience that you could have. And so I'm going to give you
1710760	1716760	two choices. You can have that experience right now, but you're going to have no memory of it
1716760	1721080	later. None, it's wiped, it wipes your memory. So let's say, you know, you've always wanted to go
1721080	1727080	skydiving and it's free. But afterwards, you will have no memory of having done it. Okay, so that's
1727080	1732040	option one. Option two is the exact opposite. We're not going to do it, but you're going to
1732040	1738120	have a memory of having done it. But you're not actually going to get to do it now. So which do
1738120	1744360	you prefer? Right? And what I find is that people have very strong feelings about this.
1745400	1749000	But about half of the people I talk to, and it's really about half and half, I think,
1749000	1755240	people that I talk to, half of them say, well, the now moment is going to be gone anyway. All
1755320	1759320	I really have are memories of anything, you know, I don't care what happens now. Give me the memory
1759320	1763560	of this beautiful, you know, skydive or whatever. And somebody else will say, well, who wants to
1763560	1768440	go around collecting memories? I like experiences. I want to have the experience. Everything else is
1768440	1772840	fake. I live in the now. Let's do it. And so I don't care if I don't remember it afterwards.
1773720	1779400	And so this is a really interesting, I think, division point of how you see yourself. Do you
1779400	1785160	see yourself as this like evanescent agent? And then, and then, you know, three hours from now,
1785160	1790120	that's not really going to be me anyway. So who cares what that I'm how I want the experience
1790120	1795080	now, that's all that exists. And then you've got the people who are like, no, no, all I am is,
1795080	1799240	is this, you know, collection of memory. So let's add to that. And there is no now, it'll be gone
1799240	1805080	shortly. So, so I think pondering that one and thinking about which type you are, I think, I
1805080	1810360	think that's kind of instructive and and how and how different people can can really differ on that.
1811960	1819640	So yeah, it's a it's a really interesting thing. So I my memories, my memory is not that good.
1820360	1825960	I really it just like when when I first read when I when I was young, I first read about this,
1825960	1830520	this idea that your memories could be false. I had, I was like, yeah, of course, I could barely
1831000	1835000	I mean, my memory, I don't know, you know, I don't really trust it that much anyway, it seemed to
1835000	1839800	make perfect sense. And so I'm one of these guys who takes lots of pictures and, you know, records
1839800	1846520	everything because that's I find it hard to kind of replay it later. So so from from from that
1846520	1855400	perspective, I can I can sort of see both views. I think that my memories aren't worth the raw
1855400	1859640	memories aren't worth all that much. So I would I would take the immediate experience. But but in
1859640	1865480	real life, I sort of augment that with with all kinds of stuff, right? So I think tons of photographs
1865480	1870360	and videos and whatnot. So yeah, I don't know, I think it's a it's a profound set of questions.
1870920	1876920	Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I have I have a silly questions. So dinosaurs not real?
1878200	1884680	Both of you. So are you saying that dinosaurs is not real? Then it's just a perceptions of us then
1884920	1886360	the vi has said.
1889080	1895640	Well, so I'll go after that. So it's quite good. I mean, so, you know, dinosaurs disappeared 65
1895640	1900760	million years ago or something like that, right? And and and that's that's our space time story. And
1900760	1909240	it's I think it's a good story. But but I would say, yes, there there is some reality. But it's
1909720	1915320	not in space and time. And if you get you get the right answer, if you think about virtual
1915320	1922360	reality most of the time. So you just always think about virtual reality. And so is is that car
1922360	1928600	that you're seeing in virtual reality? Is it really there? Well, no, it's not. It's there when you
1928600	1933880	look. Is there some reality that is causing you to see that car? Yeah, but it's not a car. It's
1933960	1939480	maybe some supercomputer or something outside of your virtual reality. So so so yeah, we we will
1939480	1945560	find dinosaur bones and we will date them a 65 million years. And that's our virtual reality
1946680	1953240	perception of it. There is there is some deeper reality that you know, that's real. But but this
1953240	1960840	is as Mike is saying, we have to recreate this stuff all the time on the fly. And and and so so
1961000	1966600	yeah, that dinosaur experience that you're having when you dig up that bone right now.
1968680	1977320	That experience only exists in the moment. And that bone didn't exist as a bone until you
1977320	1985160	perceived it. There is some other reality that does anybody else who wants to go and dig in
1985160	1990680	that area to see the bone, right? So you'll all agree. But you also agree in virtual reality,
1990680	1993800	say that, you know, if you're playing Grand Theft Auto, that everybody would agree. Oh, yeah,
1993800	1998280	you're racing a green Porsche. Everybody agrees that you're racing a green Porsche. That doesn't
1998280	2002520	mean that there really is a green Porsche. It just means everybody agrees. And so we all agree
2002520	2006760	that we see dinosaurs and we all agree that in our heads up, they look like they're 65 million
2006760	2012600	years old or older. But agreement doesn't mean that it has a preexisting reality.
2012600	2017640	So are you saying Max Delbert? He was
2018600	2020200	No, no, who's who's talking right now?
2021560	2027160	All right, it's one of the audience. Can we move on quickly done? Sorry about that.
2028120	2035240	Briefly talk about your model and catch on on the conscious agency so that you and Mike could
2035240	2041320	compare the two models. So you talk on your conscious agency and the mathematical sites of
2041320	2047640	it and then Mike could unpack it from his perspective on the biology side of it. Shall
2047640	2052920	we go on that? Sure, sure. Back to the Max Delbert thing later on in the Q&A. Absolutely. So I
2052920	2060280	didn't want to rudely stop anybody. I just didn't know who was talking. So so the conscious agent
2060280	2067080	model is a precise model of consciousness. I'm not saying it's the right model,
2067080	2071800	but it's at least mathematically precise in which we have agents that have experiences
2071800	2076680	and based on those experiences, they take actions that affect the experiences of other conscious
2076680	2083800	agents of interacting conscious agents. And the mathematics is basically Markovian. It's a
2083800	2090840	Markov chain that you get on this collection, this network of conscious agents. And
2091320	2096920	one of the things that we're doing right now in the model, which is for our next paper, which is
2096920	2103560	really fun, is looking at the role of observation. So the only thing to observe is other consciousnesses,
2103560	2109000	right? The consciousnesses are observing consciousnesses. And it's a theorem of this theory
2109000	2116680	that any collection of consciousness agents is itself a bigger agent. So ultimately, the math
2117480	2122280	says there's one agent. But it also tells us that we can never write down the one agent because
2122280	2128280	it would be infinitely long. So you can't write it down. So it's interesting that the theory says
2128280	2133480	there is one conscious agent, but it will transcend any precise mathematical description.
2133480	2138040	But we can build as big an agent as we want. And so that's what we have to do. So we have to be
2138040	2144840	modest and build big agents, but we can't build the one agent. And the only thing there is to
2144920	2150040	observe is consciousness. And it's only conscious agents that are there to observe it. So what we
2150040	2157160	can do is we can take a huge agent, which has a huge number of experiences, a huge number of states
2157160	2163240	that it perceives. So maybe, you know, a billion by it's a billion states, a billion experiences
2163240	2172040	that it can have. And we can then take any subset of states from it, maybe just 100,000 over or
2172040	2178600	2 million. And that will also correspond to a sub agent. So this will be a sub agent of this
2178600	2185400	bigger agent. And then we can take the Markovian dynamics of the big agent and do what's called
2185400	2192120	a trace chain. We can look at the Markovian dynamics that's induced on the little agent
2194360	2198440	as a consequence of the big dynamics. So it's called a trace chain. So every time,
2199080	2203880	most of the time, the state of the big agent is not in the state of one of the states of
2203880	2208840	the little agent. But when it does, then we will, you know, that little agent will get activated
2208840	2214360	and we can then build its Markov kernel. You know, we can actually describe over time what
2214360	2218040	is Markovian kernel is. So there's some big Markovian kernel, but we can induce
2219560	2224600	little Markovian kernels on all the sub agents. So if you have a big agent with N
2225320	2232760	states and experiences that it can perceive, then there are two to the N sub agents,
2232760	2237720	including the original agent, two to the N sub agents. So, and so you have two to the N
2240120	2245160	different Markovian kernels or trace chains that you can look at. And so you're now going
2245160	2251480	to get a very interesting group structure. So how do the different agents see the deeper reality?
2251560	2257000	So you will, I bet we'll see in some cases, we can get a Lorentz transformation relating them
2257000	2261000	or Euclidean transformation. So we will start to see how the different agents
2263320	2269240	perceptions differ systematically as you change the agent. But the other thing that is interesting
2269240	2274840	is that not only the, we might call the spatial window, which particular subset of states you're
2274840	2279880	using, but how many steps of the chain do you want to look at? Do you want to look at only 50
2279880	2284760	steps or 100 or a billion or a trillion? I mean, ultimately Markov chains are supposed to go off
2284760	2293560	to infinity. But imagining finite temporal windows, and it turns out when you do that,
2294280	2301320	what each sub agent will see depends almost entirely on this temporal window as well as the
2301320	2308120	spatial window. So when you have a very small temporal window, you will, and I can go into the
2308120	2314600	mathematics of this, but what you will see with small temporal windows is what we believe will
2314600	2321400	turn out to be bosons in physics. These are massless particles. So Don, and you'll see
2321400	2328440	tons of bosons. So Don, the matter matter sites of it, right? The W represents the world, and then
2328440	2334920	you got the perceived, the P, and then you got the A, the R, and then you got the measurable,
2334920	2341480	you got the measurable space between the experience, the acts, and then the action, the G.
2342040	2345720	So what is that measurable experience that you're measuring though?
2347960	2354280	So what are those measurable spaces? Yeah. So those measurable spaces are probability spaces.
2355240	2361560	So anytime that you have some kind of probabilistic dynamics, you need to have a probability
2361560	2366440	space in which the dynamics can take place. And so that's the case with these Markovian
2366440	2371240	dynamics. And what's interesting is I didn't think about that for the longest time. We, you know,
2371960	2376440	it's just derigure that if you're going to write down a, you know, probability,
2377880	2381720	then you have to write down a probability space. And I didn't even think about what the probability
2381720	2387800	so years later, but I realized that I was only focused on the experiences. But what about the
2387880	2393320	probability space in which they occur? And it seems to me that a natural interpretation
2393320	2399960	of the probability space itself is to be interpreted as pure awareness without any
2399960	2404360	particular content, something that spiritual traditions have talked about for a long time.
2404360	2409160	So here is the pure awareness, which is the potential. I'm sorry.
2409960	2418040	Is it the verdict you're talking about, the Indian philosophy about the observer position,
2418040	2423320	the afman, go backward to the brahman? Is that the one that you're talking about?
2424600	2430360	That would be, I think that's one example of it. I think all the different spiritual traditions
2430360	2435800	point with their own words to the same kind of thing. And what was interesting to me was,
2435800	2440360	I mean, I wasn't trying to model that. I just was trying to do the math and I had to write
2440360	2446200	down a probability space. And I didn't even think about it. And it was only years that
2446200	2451160	probability space. And the only interpretation that makes sense is something along the lines of this
2452440	2458120	unbounded potential for experience, namely awareness of pure awareness without any particular
2458120	2466040	content. And then many spiritual traditions will then say, that is what you are. You are
2466040	2471800	not the particular content, this particular body or this particular color that you're seeing or
2471800	2476200	this particular headache that you're feeling. That's not what you are. Those are just experiences
2476200	2483480	that are arising in this fundamental awareness. And you are that fundamental awareness, not just
2483480	2493480	the things that arise. So Don, the end represents our selfhood, the observer position. That's where
2493480	2502920	the end comes in. And that triangle, mathematical graph. Oh, well, in the perception, decision,
2502920	2508520	action loop, and there's also an integer n that we have there, that was simply just to
2509400	2514440	a counter for the number of steps of the Markovian Internet. So you need a counter,
2514440	2521560	in some sense, to say what step of the chain you're in. So that was just a technical thing.
2522760	2527720	It's not time. It's just the sequence counter of the Markov chain.
2529560	2537160	Thank you, Mike. Yeah. So I end up basically at the same point as Don. And let me walk it
2537160	2544440	backwards towards the biology of where I think it comes from. If you didn't already know what it
2544440	2549160	was to communicate with a human and somebody showed you a three pound, you know, three and a half
2549160	2554760	pound brain, and they say, so how many, how many cells do you think you think are in there? Well,
2554760	2560600	we have absolutely no idea because, because I priori, you don't really know what the dense,
2560600	2565560	you know, the the agential density of this material is, you have no idea. And, and the thing is that,
2565640	2570040	and then of course, in, you know, you get to split brain patients and dissociative states, we still
2570040	2576280	actually, it's still not super clear, you know, how to count these things. But, but it's interesting
2576280	2582440	that in biology, every, every cell is some other cells neighbor. In fact, every cell, every cellular
2582440	2586760	neighbor is some other cells external environment. And so this question of, you know, what Don was
2586760	2594680	saying of different, different cells, sort of being within the kind of a larger structure,
2594680	2602040	this is almost guaranteed because, because there is no obvious and unambiguous way to say where
2602040	2609240	any one self ends and any other self begins. And biology is always multi scale and at every,
2609240	2613560	everything is made up, you know, so, so like Descartes was looking, he liked the pineal gland
2613560	2618440	because there was just one of them. But one of what if you look inside, it's full of cell,
2618440	2622040	the thing's full of cells, there's not one of anything. And if you look inside the cells,
2622120	2625800	guess what you find, you find a bunch of molecules. I mean, there really is no one of
2625800	2629960	anything, everything is made of sort of components. And, and you really start to see this when you
2629960	2634520	look at basic embryogenesis, which I think is super important here, it's this, this journey
2634520	2639480	that each of us took from being a an unfertilized, the oocyte, you know, this blob of chemicals
2639480	2644200	into whatever it is that we are now. Let's just look at the early time points of this, right? So,
2644200	2650440	so, so what happens is you have, you have this embryonic blastoderm. So it's a flat in, in the
2650440	2656040	mammals and birds, it's like this flat disc. And okay, 50,000 cells or something. So you look at
2656040	2661560	this thing, and we say, oh, look, there's, that's an embryo. Now, what did you just count as an
2661560	2666200	embryo? There's one of what, well, there's 50,000 cells, what is there one of? Well, there's one
2666200	2673960	of if you put a particular lens on this thing, and you say, I'm going to count the system that
2673960	2679160	attempts to that is going to use energy and attempt to build a particular structure. Basically,
2679160	2683720	what I'm going to count is goal directed systems. I'm going to say how many different
2683720	2687320	goal directed systems are there. And what you will find is that all of these cells will work
2687320	2691080	together towards a particular anatomical goal. You can the other way to think about it, if you
2691080	2695240	don't like go talk, is that it's trying to reach a particular region of anatomical morphous space,
2695240	2700040	where you've got a couple eyes, you've got the right number of toes, all that stuff. So, so a
2700040	2703640	bunch of these cells get together, and they're all going to work on this one construction project.
2703640	2707880	Everybody agrees every step, this is what they're, this is what they're working on. Okay, so, so,
2707880	2711320	so now you've counted one, you say, well, there you go, that's a, that's a separate self, it's a
2711320	2715000	separate consciousness, it's going to be a human embryo, let's say we know what that looks like.
2715000	2722680	Except that if you were to come along at that early stage, and I've done this in avian with,
2722680	2726920	with chicken eggs and things like this, when I was a grad student, you take a little needle,
2726920	2731720	and you make a couple of scratches in that blastoderm. Eventually, it's going to heal up,
2731720	2736840	they're going to heal. But before they heal, what happens is that every group of cells that cannot
2736840	2741640	feel the other cells, because you put a scratch between them, decides that, well, it's just me,
2741640	2747160	then. And so they form an embryo, and every island forms an embryo, and then when they heal,
2747160	2752280	you have conjoined twins, and or triplets or whatever. So the question of, so you look at an
2752280	2759480	embryo, and you say, well, how many are in there? It could be anywhere from zero to some small
2759480	2765560	number of them, because that question is decided on the fly. It is not pre-programmed, it is decided
2765560	2771560	on the fly by the physiology of a bunch of cells making a decision of how they're going to coalesce
2771560	2776920	towards one machine that's going to take this morphogenetic journey, this movement through
2776920	2783720	anatomical morphospace. So what happens then is that you realize that what you've got is you've
2783720	2789720	got this almost like this Freudian ocean of possibility, these 50,000 cells, and out of them
2789720	2795000	might come some number of intelligences. And once you realize that that's the case, and that
2795800	2800600	within this one thing, there could be three different conjoined twins, and this, of course,
2800600	2805560	happens in humans as well as other animals, then you realize that fine, the adult human body,
2805560	2813000	or any animal body, also has within it various collectives, such as organs and various other
2813000	2821320	things that for the exact same, and so I'll just back up and say that I don't have a theory of
2821400	2827080	consciousness that I'm sort of propagating, like many other people do, I don't have my own, maybe
2827080	2831240	I will at some point, I don't now, so I don't have too much to say about consciousness except this.
2832280	2838200	All, as far as I can tell, all of the theories of consciousness that try to explain why brains
2838200	2843480	are associated with consciousness in some way, for the exact same reason that all of those theories
2843480	2848600	pick the brain to be able to do it, pretty much every tissue in your body should be judged as
2848600	2854280	conscious, because all of these things that these theories talk about, and let's say the neuroscience
2854280	2858680	theories, they lean on things like, well, there are these integrated electrical networks and we've
2858680	2863240	got some neurotransmitters and some ion channel, all of this stuff exists all over your body.
2863240	2870280	I have yet to come across a theory of consciousness that tells you why the brain is different from
2870280	2875400	anything else. And when you sort of start to poke at it, they say, well, then it's the magnetic
2875400	2878840	field of it. They say, okay, how about the magnetic field of the liver? Why is that different?
2878840	2882520	Well, I guess it probably isn't. I mean, that's right, that's where you end up. There's just no
2882520	2887960	one has drawn that line for a very good reason, because neurons evolved from systems that were
2887960	2892120	other cell types that were using these electrical communications long before brain showed up.
2892120	2898280	So for the same reason that you might now, consciousness is not going to be verbal consciousness,
2898280	2904360	you're not going to talk to it using using language, and you're probably not aware of it
2904360	2909160	anymore than you are aware of your other nonverbal hemisphere and the opinions that it has that
2909160	2913000	you don't even know about, because you're not aware of it. But it's entirely plausible,
2913000	2919320	given the developmental biology, that we are these nested hierarchies of diverse
2919320	2923960	conscious agents that are all having experiences and solving problems in different spaces,
2923960	2929560	all kinds of weird spaces. So transcriptional, so gene expression spaces, metabolic spaces,
2929560	2934600	physiological spaces, anatomical spaces, we love the three-dimensional sort of space of
2934600	2939320	the where it's easy for us to recognize intelligence, but that's just our own limitation.
2940760	2947000	If you had a, just imagine that you had a primary sense of your own blood chemistry,
2947000	2951800	instead of, in addition to your retina that looks outwards for medium-sized objects moving at medium
2951800	2955800	speeds, you would also have an internal sensor of your blood chemistry and you could feel it.
2955800	2959080	You would have no problem recognizing your liver as extremely intelligent,
2959160	2962600	because it would be solving all these problems on a daily basis and you would know, you would feel
2962600	2966920	it. I mean, the same way that we see, oh, look, that crow in that octopus, look at the amazing
2966920	2971560	things they're doing. You would see your liver doing that stuff every day if you had the perception
2971560	2976680	of this other space. And we can build things, right? So at some point, we'll talk about synthetic
2976680	2982760	beings and we can build things that will have consciousness in those spaces. But so I end up
2982760	2989960	exactly where Don ends up. I think that we are these nested hierarchies of consciousness. This is
2989960	2995560	only some of them are verbal. Only some of them do we have any direct connection to, but they're
2995560	2999960	all over the place and we're bad at recognizing them and that's why we need to, you know, we need
2999960	3009960	to think about these things more. Don? Brilliant. That's brilliant, Mike. And I agree. I'm definitely
3009960	3015320	not the biologist that Mike is, but I'll just throw in another simple biology example to support
3015320	3022120	what he's saying. And that is with split brain patients, right? So some people who have intractable
3022120	3029800	epilepsy that can't be treated with normal drugs were in extreme cases where they were,
3029800	3036760	their lives were on the line, submitted to a surgery called colosotomy surgery, where they would
3037720	3041720	Joe Bogan, who was a friend of mine, would actually take a scalpel and go in there and cut the corpus
3041720	3047400	colosum, which was a band of about 220 million fibers that connect the right and left hemispheres
3047400	3053480	of the brain. And it was a success. If the epileptic focus was on the right hemisphere,
3053480	3059320	you would spare the left hemisphere from getting bothered by an epileptic seizure. And so it was
3059320	3065800	a clinical success. But then some other friends of mine and other researchers started to study,
3066440	3071240	what's different about these people that have their brains cut in half? And Mike Zaniga and many
3071240	3078760	others, but did this. But friend of mine, Ramacandra, V.S. Ramacandran at UC San Diego, friends called
3078760	3085320	Rama. So what Rama did was he found one patient in which the right hemisphere, I believe,
3086360	3093320	was an atheist and left hemisphere believed in God. So here, and another case was found in
3093320	3096920	which the right hemisphere wanted to be a race car driver and the left hemisphere wanted to have a
3096920	3105320	desk job. So you have, you know, those are as different a personality as you could possibly want
3106040	3111880	stuck inside one cranium. And so that raises the question, here I am with my corpus colosum intact.
3112440	3119000	And why is it that on Friday night, a battle going on about what I want? Maybe one part of me
3119000	3122760	says, let's go out and have fun. The other part says, no, I got a book I want to read.
3122760	3127560	Well, maybe there are two people in there. And they really want to do two different things on
3127560	3134280	Friday night. And I do have to negotiate among them. And so who is the I now that is doing
3134280	3139400	the negotiation among those two people? So the whole notion of a self then becomes really interesting
3139400	3148680	and very problematic. So I agree completely with Mike on that. And again, a big issue here is
3149400	3157720	we're only seeing things through a space time interface. Right. And so it's not like, for
3157720	3162600	example, the distinction we make between living and non living, or conscious and unconscious
3163560	3169640	is a principle distinction. Right. So just to get what I'm talking about here, I'm looking at
3170440	3176120	all of you on a zoom screen. So I'm looking at Mike right now on the zoom screen. And some of the
3176120	3183080	pixels are pixels for Mike's face. And when I look at those pixels, I'm getting a portal into
3183080	3186520	Mike's consciousness. I can tell if he's interested, I can tell if he's bored, I can tell
3187320	3191560	I get some insight into his consciousness. But there are other pixels of a floor, for example,
3191560	3197320	in the back of this chair. And those pixels are not giving me any insight about consciousness.
3197320	3202440	Now, should I say that some pixels are conscious? And other pixels on my zoom screen are not
3202440	3207960	conscious. That's stupid. Pixels are pixels. They're not conscious or unconscious. Some of
3207960	3213800	them are giving me a portal into Mike's consciousness and others are not. So it's not so the same thing
3213800	3219160	is true of space and time and what we call physical objects. There is the distinction we make between
3219160	3223640	Oh, that's alive. And that's dead or that's conscious. And that's not conscious is the same
3223640	3227720	mistake as saying, Oh, those are those are conscious pixels. And those are unconscious pixels on my
3227720	3232840	zoom screen. It's exactly the same mistake. An interface is just an interface. It's not the
3232840	3239000	truth. So, so it's not a principal distinction between living and non living. It's an artifact
3239000	3246680	of the limitations of our interface that we're mistaking for insight into the nature of reality.
3246680	3252440	It's a rookie mistake. So we have to get past the rookie mistake of saying that the distinctions
3252440	3256760	that we see in our interface are therefore necessarily true in reality.
3259000	3263720	Sorry, I just want to add one one funny. Well, I don't know if it's funny, but a story of a kind
3263720	3269480	of a troubling story that that goes with Don's point about having two different opinions in
3269480	3276840	your in your brain. And so I read this. This was a description of a therapist as a psychiatrist
3276840	3281480	to have this experience. So, so this guy this patient comes in and he says, I've got some sort
3281480	3287080	of dissociative disorder where I've got there's a personality in there that he's a real partier
3287080	3290440	and and I like to work and and he just started, you know, I can't I can't work anymore because
3290440	3294200	sometimes he comes out and screws up, you know, he acts, you know, acts like a fool at work and
3294200	3297960	whatever we need to take care of this. And so, you know, they start doing some sort of I don't
3297960	3302840	even know how they do it, but some sort of integrative therapy and so so one day one day
3302840	3307080	the patient walks in and it's the other guy. And he says, Hey, what's this I hear about
3307080	3312120	integrating integrate? What are you guys doing? And the doctor says, Well, you know, we're going
3312120	3318920	to integrate you. And he says, Excuse me, you're going to integrate me and who's going to be left?
3318920	3322840	He says, Well, you know, you'll be well, you'll do well at work. Wait a minute,
3322840	3327000	wait a minute, where am I going to be? And he's and the doctor said, Well, you're kind of going
3327000	3332920	to be gone. I hope if you know, if we do, are you kidding? What? What happened to the hypocriticals?
3332920	3337480	What do you mean? I'm going to be gone. I don't want to be gone. You know, he's a boring, you
3337480	3344200	know, he's boring. I've got the fun life to make him gone. And so and right. So just put yourself
3344200	3349560	in that in that place, right? I mean, presumably the other, you know, the other personality signs
3349560	3354520	the checks and everything. But but but but you're faced with a coherent. This isn't some weird tick
3354520	3359640	or reflex. This is a coherent being that is making an argument that knows what what a
3359640	3364120	hypocritical it is and is making an argument that whatever that whatever you're doing is going
3364120	3369960	to erase them from the world by sort of somehow jamming you down into this into this integrated
3369960	3376040	personality that can spend, you know, 12 hours at work and not have any fun. So that's, I mean,
3376040	3381720	that's a super, you know, it's a super disturbing sort of kind of, you know, way to think about this
3381720	3389080	because we there are no as far as I know, there are no indivisible beings. We are all made of
3389080	3395240	parts that that's just how it has to be. And therefore, there is the possibility of that,
3395240	3401560	that magical, which I think if anything is magical, this is it, it's this this this process by which
3401560	3408840	by which merge into a larger scale, collective, you know, self or individual, that that process
3408840	3412680	is going to have failure modes, some of them temporary, some of them permanent. And and it's
3412680	3417320	these failure modes that really give us something to think about in terms of what are we and who
3417320	3425320	are we and how we relate to each other. Fabulous, fabulous. Yeah, we recently have McGiocchus. Ian
3425320	3431960	McGiocchus came to our club last Monday. Yeah, he has booked the matter with things. Yeah, he talked
3431960	3439160	about the the laugh and right hemisphere hypothesis a lot in his book on his volume one. Yeah, we're
3439160	3447080	going to quickly move on before because Mike got to go pretty soon, probably about 30 minutes
3447160	3452360	time. But but don't you can stay with us for another hours, right? So that I'm going to go
3452360	3459560	straight to the the last question. So these conscious agents, the common factor done. So all
3459560	3467080	these multi multiplicity and diversity of conscious agents. So how many of them so they're all going
3467080	3474040	towards one field of consciousness. Is that what it is? And you speak on that, right? So
3474760	3481160	so there's it's quite interesting. Suppose I start off with a countable infinity of conscious
3481160	3487080	agents. So there's agent one, two, three, four, all the way to the countable infinity, then any
3487080	3493160	combination of any subset of them. So agent one and two, agent one, two and three, whatever, that
3493160	3499160	also is a conscious agent. That's a theorem of the math that any collection of conscious agents is
3499160	3503640	also a conscious agent. So that means that I started off with a countable infinity of
3503640	3508600	conscious agents. I can take the power set with what the mathematicians call the power set.
3508600	3513400	That's the number of new conscious agents that come from combination. Well, that's a higher
3513400	3521000	level of infinity. That's, you know, a left one. And now with that new set of agents, I can take
3521000	3528360	their power set. Now I'm at a left to consciously. So now I'm marching my way up Cantor's hierarchy
3528440	3535000	of infinities, and there's no end to that hierarchy of infinities. So so it's a it's a theorem that
3535000	3542120	there is just one. And it's also a fact that I'll never be able to get there, which is again,
3542120	3547640	again, also in line with the spiritual traditions, right, that they they say that anything that we
3547640	3553640	can say about it, like the Buddhists will say, a finger pointing to the moon is not the moon,
3553640	3558680	is just a finger pointing. And so that will be true of our scientific descriptions as well. We
3558680	3566760	have to recognize that the scientific distractions are scientific theories are merely
3568040	3573480	pointers, and they're not the reality. And in this case, what's what's nice about the scientific
3573480	3580200	pointers is that they tell you that they're not the reality, they tell you that they are limited.
3580200	3585640	And that's what's beautiful about the scientific pointers, like Einstein series space time. And
3585640	3591960	with quantum field theory tells us that that pointer that space time idea fails at 10 to the
3591960	3597640	minus 33 centimeters, that's where the pointer stops, and the moon begins, right, whatever's
3597640	3604360	beyond begins. And so, so the conscious agent theory has the same nice property. It says,
3604360	3610520	basically, there is one conscious agent. And I can't describe it, I can, I can go to a left
3610520	3615880	zero, I can go maybe to go to a left one. Of course, even then I'll fail because I don't have a
3615880	3620120	super computer that can do it. So and I don't have enough paper to do it. So already you can see
3620120	3626040	that that is telling you this is a pointer and the reality is going to transcend the pointer
3626040	3634120	completely. Absolutely. Mike, did you agree in that night? They're all pointed to one or you're
3634120	3644840	still keen on your panpsychism? I think, I think both. I think they're not mutually exclusive.
3644840	3655720	I think that there are, I mean, to me, recognizing agency and consciousness in the world around
3655720	3663000	you is a lens that you bring to the process like any other. And so if you if you have a way of
3663000	3671240	recognizing intelligence in components of something that's great, and then you may have, you may also
3671240	3676840	observe that the whole thing is so so so just to give an example, we recently, there's this there's
3676840	3681160	this mathematical notion of a gene regulatory network, it's very simple. It's a collection of
3681160	3687480	nodes, let's say a dozen of these nodes. And you're just going to write down how each one up or down
3687480	3690840	regulates some others. So it's this like little network. And you can, you know, people have been
3690840	3696440	like Stu Kaufman has been studying this for a long time. And you can you can view them as as
3699240	3703800	dynamical systems and see what they do and so on. So you look at this thing, and you say, well,
3703800	3708520	okay, it's very simple, I can see all the parts, there's nowhere to hide here. This is like the
3708520	3715000	rock bottom of deterministic, you know, zero agency mechanical system, there's just nothing there.
3715720	3719960	So we took the hypothesis. So my view always is that you can't just make these pronouncements
3719960	3723400	from a from an armchair, you have to do experiments. So we said, okay, what if we just
3724040	3729320	what if what if we test the hypothesis that this thing has some degree of, of, of cognitive
3729320	3734040	of cognitive ability. So what we what we ended up doing was testing their learning capacity
3734040	3739320	in the following in the following way, we assign some one of the nodes as a condition stimulus,
3739320	3744920	another node as an unconditioned stimulus, and pick some other node as the read as the response.
3744920	3749000	And then we do things like Pavlovian conditioning, we, you know, we twiddle two of them simultaneously
3749000	3753000	and we look at what happens. Anyway, you get the idea. So so we now have a couple of papers on this
3753000	3758120	that biological networks, and not so much random networks. So I think evolution likes this because
3758120	3762760	a biological networks do this more than random ones do biological networks show six different
3762760	3767720	kinds of learning, including associative conditioning in this in this dirt simple system.
3767720	3771480	And that's with no, with no changing of the network structure. So we're not changing the
3771480	3774680	synaptic weights, we're not rearranging the networking, none of that. This is purely,
3774680	3779800	purely dynamical system stuff. But but but there is a lens. So there are two different two competing
3779800	3784360	lenses on the same phenomenon. One is the standard molecular biology lens. This thing is dumb as a
3784360	3788840	rock. And what you if you're going to change the way it works, let's say for biomedical purposes,
3788920	3793400	your only hope is bottom up rewiring, you need to add nodes, subtract nodes, you know, genomic
3793400	3797320	editing to change the way that these nodes interact with each other. That's your only hope. There's
3797320	3803240	another lens, which makes a completely different prediction. And if you which is that which is
3803240	3807720	that actually, if you treat if you don't rewire anything, but you treat this thing as a minimally
3807720	3813800	cognitive agent that that can be manipulated by experiences, by stimuli, by training, then you
3813800	3817960	can do some more stuff. And then you can look at these two lessons say, gee, this one tells us a
3817960	3821880	lot that we can use in biomedicine that we're actually not getting out of here. Right. So so
3821880	3825640	you can have multiple perspectives, they have different powers in terms of what they let you
3825640	3828920	do in the real world. Maybe someday somebody else will come along and say, ah, you're both wrong,
3828920	3834520	here's a much better lens, you know, fine, that's how it goes. So so then so then that that allows
3834520	3840680	you to have it all, you can you look at a human body and you say, I'm looking really deep and I
3840680	3846200	see some components that clearly have their own thing going on. But of course, so does the organ
3846200	3851160	that they sit in and because because that has certain certain interesting capabilities in
3851160	3855320	physiological space. And then the whole thing that we're going to call a human, well, that's a
3855320	3859240	bigger intelligence that can do other things in behavioral space, maybe linguistic space.
3859240	3866040	So I I see it both ways. I think I think the merging is is is correct. I think Don's totally
3866040	3871000	right about all of that. But I also think that there are useful lenses that allow you to exploit
3871000	3875800	a panpsychist view. And just to be clear, you know, the there's a couple of different versions
3875800	3880200	of panpsychism. The one where the one where you take a perfectly good physics and then paint some
3880200	3884600	hopes and dreams on all the electrons, that's not that's not the one, right? So people correctly
3884600	3889560	make fun of that one, because that's just not going to give you anything. There's a different,
3889560	3893640	however, research program, which which which Don and people like Chris Fields and Karl first and
3893640	3901880	other people are doing, which is to reformulate physics from the the cognitive perspective.
3901880	3905640	So it's not that we have a perfectly good physics. And now we're going to paint some extra junk on
3905640	3911640	it. No, it's that actually, what we have been taking as physics is a, I don't know what the
3911640	3916520	right word for it, but but it's a it's a it's an oversimplification and a not a really not not
3916520	3920840	the best lens. I mean, it's done well in many areas, but it's not the best lens. And you can
3920840	3926360	formulate a different lens, where things like active inference and some of these other extremely
3926360	3930360	general things, and I don't pretend to be any kind of expert on active inference. But but but I
3930360	3935720	understand the research program, it helps you understand inanimate things and interactions
3935720	3940840	between living things and non living things from the same with the same lens. And I think that's
3940840	3946280	super powerful. And so I think you can have a useful version of panpsychism, where you scale
3946280	3950040	down your cognitive expectations. It's not that the rocks have hopes and dreams like humans,
3950040	3955240	that's not the point. The point is that you can use the same tools, including, you know,
3955560	3960440	active inference and some and trainability and some other things to understand both physical
3960440	3966040	processes and then eventually, you know, advanced cognitive properties, maybe social phenomena,
3966040	3970360	who knows? Yeah, anyway, so that's a long answer to your question.
3972120	3978280	Thank you. So how many conversations then to make a photon down? That's a question from the audience.
3978840	3981000	Ah, so
3983960	3987960	that's what we're going to be working on on our very next paper. We're calling it
3989000	3995560	tentatively titled traces of consciousness paper. And the idea is that I was talking about these
3995560	4002120	trace chains, right? You've got a big, dynamical system of consciousness agent, a big agent,
4002120	4007480	but I can look at the two to the n sub agents and do a trace chain on each one of those.
4007480	4014520	And I can change the temporal window. And so I should say just a little bit of background about
4015480	4020920	what motivates what I'm about to tell you. So in the paper that we just published last week,
4021560	4027640	we proved that the Markov chains map on two decorated permutations. I mentioned that earlier.
4028680	4032840	Decorated permutations and the decorated permutations the physicists have shown
4032840	4037720	are the deepest structure they found behind space time. And with decorated permutations, you can
4037720	4043960	then create things like the amplitohedron and compute scattering amplitudes like two gluons
4044840	4049400	smashing into each other and four gluons go spraying out. So you actually, you can compute
4049400	4055080	all of the scattering amplitudes. Truly, if you just have these decorated permutations and maybe
4055160	4063480	momentum and spin data as well. And so when we made this mapping from our Markov dynamics onto
4063480	4068520	decorated permutations and decorated permutations into space time, that gave us the clue there's a
4068520	4075160	particular aspect of our dynamics of conscious agents that's critical for the physics and the
4075160	4080680	mapping of the physics. And it's called the communicating classes. So that's the key thing.
4081000	4085400	They're so called. So if you look at Markov chains online, you can see what the communicating
4085400	4092680	classes are. It's a standard part of Markov chains. So our hypothesis, the one that I'm working on
4092680	4098600	right now is that the so-called entropy rate, this is the technical term in Markov chains. So if
4098600	4106680	you look it up online as well, entropy rate of a communicating class is what corresponds to mass
4107640	4114600	in space time. Okay. So particles in space time are projections of communicating classes, but
4114600	4118680	most communicating classes project to things far more interesting than particles. But particles are
4118680	4124120	projections of communicating classes. And for those communicating classes that project to particles,
4124120	4130360	it's the entropy rate that is their mass. So when you look at what I technically what I just said,
4130360	4136600	it means that if the Markovian dynamics, if the Markov kernel has only zeros and ones
4137320	4144440	in the matrix, then it will project to a massless particle like a photon. So now I'm getting to
4144440	4151480	your question about photons. You can see why I had to spend some time, right? The zero entropy rate
4151480	4158520	communicating classes project to massless particles, or I should say mass lift particle, the better
4158520	4163640	way to say this, massless particles are the projection of zero communicating, zero entry rate
4163640	4167720	communicating classes, because communicating classes don't necessarily project to particles,
4167720	4172120	they can project to more interesting things than particles. Particles are the simplest. So
4173240	4178760	that means, so now we want to find out exactly what specific, there are lots of different
4178760	4184360	kinds of Markovian kernels that are that have zero entropy rate. Some of them are, for example,
4184360	4189720	are derangements. They're permutations called derangements, and there are other kinds that
4189720	4198120	will have combinations of derangements, as well as absorbing states. So we want to look at those
4198120	4203800	and then figure out, okay, which correspond to like photons, but photons are not the only kind
4203800	4209400	of bosons. There is also gluons, there are W particles and Z particles, and then there's a
4209400	4217880	Higgs. So there's a number of massless particles, and so we'll want to get this dictionary between
4217880	4225000	the particular kinds of permutation matrices and which ones mapped to which with massless
4225000	4231400	particles. So that you can see that there's a lot of fun work ahead, but it's a deep technical
4231400	4237640	question. Looking forward to it, Lauren. So we're going to open up the floor for Q&A. We
4239480	4245240	are on the stage waiting to ask both of you some questions. So we're going to open it up now.
4246280	4255080	We have Prakash. Yes, greetings. Fantastic talk, good conversation. I was just curious.
4256600	4261080	You know, looking at living systems, I always wonder where would you put plants in this picture?
4262200	4268200	Plants are living agents. They don't seem to have neurons, but they have the same cellular space.
4268840	4273160	I was just wondering what you would have to share about what do you think about plants?
4275560	4280520	Who's the question to us? Prakash, is it to both?
4281400	4287080	Mike makes sense. Yeah, to break out the model.
4290200	4298360	Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Mike, would you want to go first, Mike? Sure, sure. Well, I can do two
4298360	4303720	things. One is, so there certainly are people who study this question of plant intelligence.
4303720	4309720	There have been some nice papers on that. People like Frantisek Balushka and some other folks
4311400	4317000	really talk about plant cognition and plant intelligence. From my perspective,
4317720	4322600	plants are not nearly weird enough as a challenging example for all of this kind of stuff. I mean,
4324920	4330040	and other people, of course, spend time thinking about really minimal models compared to which plants
4330040	4337560	are a no-brainer to pardon the pun for having cognitive capacities, including anticipation
4337640	4343160	and memory and learning and creative problem solving and various things. Plants do all of that.
4344280	4350200	So, yeah, I have zero. The fact that they don't have neurons means almost nothing to me. I think
4352040	4357080	as we think about the wide universe, I find it impossible to believe that the only things that
4357080	4361800	have cognition are things with actual neurons like we have. I mean, that seems like just an
4361800	4370760	incredibly implausible view to me. And we came from, a lot of electrophysiology was done in
4370760	4375880	bacteria anyway. I mean, neurons, they do some interesting things, but this is way wider than
4375880	4386520	that. So, yeah, no problem with plants. I agree with Mike, and I think you said it well. So, yeah,
4386600	4393880	absolutely. Thank you. Are we going to move on to Andy? Hey, thank you both for being here.
4393880	4396760	This is fascinating. Thank you, Ivy and John, for making this happen.
4398600	4403080	It's hard to decide what to drill into. I would like to drill into this idea of the
4405000	4413400	simulations, the simulations that you claim prove that perception of truth leads to extinction.
4414040	4419400	So, I want to drill in this idea of truth a little bit. What do you mean by truth versus
4419400	4425960	fitness? It seems like fitness is a sort of truth for a biological system. And can you give an
4425960	4433720	example of the perception, like a true perception of a thing leading to less fitness than a false
4433720	4440920	perception and or a false perception of a thing leading to more fitness than a true perception
4440920	4449640	of a thing? And, you know, and finally, isn't the results say more about the simulation and how
4449640	4455320	it's built and the built-in approximations and assumptions and biases that are built into it,
4455320	4464840	then it says about reality. Thank you. That's a great question. So, I'll first just give you
4464840	4469400	as for an intuitive example that we might help understand why not knowing the truth could help
4469400	4475080	you out. I'll just give an intuitive example. In virtual reality, say, again, Grand Theft Auto,
4475080	4480040	you're trying to race against a bunch of friends, you know, you got your car and you're racing a
4480040	4486680	Porsche and the Maserati and so forth. And what are you really doing in reality in this metaphor?
4486680	4491080	What you're really doing to win the game is you're toggling millions of voltages per second
4491080	4497320	in a precise order. That's what you're doing to try to win the game. And that's in this metaphor,
4497320	4501080	that's the reality. What you're doing, what you know about what you're doing is you're turning
4501080	4505880	a steering wheel and you're pushing on a gas pedal. A lot, lot simpler than toggling a million
4505880	4511160	voltages per second in a precise order. So, now, if you said, well, yeah, I want to know the truth
4511160	4514040	and I'm going to try to play the game knowing the truth. I'm going to actually toggle the million
4514040	4520120	voltages per second to try to win. So, I can guarantee you the person who's trying to toggle
4520120	4524680	those voltages as fast as they can would lose against someone who is just turning a steering
4524680	4530120	wheel and pushing on the gas. And that's the top-level intuition why evolution hit the truth
4530120	4535880	from our eyes is because if you had to actually toggle all of reality, you would die in the
4535880	4540120	process. Better to give you just a user interface that hides most of that from you. So, that's the
4540120	4550840	intuition. But now for the math, we did simulations to begin with just to check to see what would
4550840	4557480	happen. And once we found that organisms that saw a reality word were going extinct, we then
4557480	4561560	let go of the simulations, we went to the math. So, I went to a mathematician. So, we now have
4561560	4566040	theorems. So, it's not, we're not relying on simulations at all. We have theorems. And the
4566040	4571640	theorems are using the tools of evolutionary game theory. And in evolutionary game theory, the key
4571640	4577880	technical notion are fitness payoff functions. The domain of that function includes whatever
4577880	4582520	objective reality might be. Evolutionary game theory doesn't tell you what objective reality is.
4582520	4587880	It just says there is some objective reality. It could include organisms, their states, their
4587880	4596280	actions, and so forth. And then, so there's this fitness payoff that includes whatever objective
4596280	4600200	reality is in the domain of the function. And the range of the function are the possible payoff
4600200	4606200	values, say from 0 to 100. 0 means very, very bad. 100 means wonderful, wonderful payoff, say.
4607160	4615960	And you can ask a clean technical question. What is the probability that a generically
4615960	4625800	chosen payoff function will be a homomorphism of some structure in the objective reality,
4625800	4632120	like a total order in objective reality or, you know, a measurable structure or topology
4632120	4637720	or whatever it might be? In other words, what is the probability that a fitness payoff function
4637720	4644360	will actually have information about structures in objective reality? Because if it doesn't have
4644360	4649640	information about the structures, how can it tune you to the structures in objective reality?
4649640	4658600	So we ask the technical question, do fitness payoff functions generically contain information
4658600	4665720	about structures in objective reality? And we, if you want to see the math, you can Google our
4665720	4671960	papers called Fact, Fiction, and Fitness. So that's the paper where we go through the math.
4671960	4677160	And what, Chaitan is the mathematician, not Don Hoffman. Chaitan is the mathematician,
4677160	4683480	but of course we collaborate on it. And what we prove is that for several different structures,
4683480	4687080	but when you see the trend, you realize it's true basically for all structures,
4687080	4694680	the probability is zero, precisely zero, that a generically chosen payoff function
4695800	4699240	will have any information about objective reality, about any structure in objective
4699240	4704200	reality. So there's nothing in the fitness payoff functions to tune you to objective reality.
4704760	4711240	Now, I'll just mention a couple quick objections that people see. One objection that
4712200	4725080	made in Sintes recently is, look, you're using evolutionary game theory. So either you believe
4725080	4732600	that evolution, the math of evolutionary game theory models biological evolution correctly,
4732600	4738760	or you don't believe it does. And if you do believe it models biological evolution correctly,
4738760	4743240	well, biological evolution assumes that there are physical objects like organisms in space and
4743240	4751480	time and resources. And if you don't believe that, so if you're going to use evolutionary
4751480	4755080	game theory to say that there are no such thing as physical objects in space, time is fundamental
4755080	4759960	reality, then that would be contradicted. You'd be contradicting yourself because the math,
4759960	4765960	you're claiming the math faithfully models the physical biology. And if you don't think the math
4766040	4769880	of evolutionary game theory models the physical biology, then you shouldn't use it anyway because
4769880	4774200	you didn't think it models. So either way, you're stuck in a logical contradiction. That's
4774200	4782280	sort of his argument. And what that argument misses is how science works. So take Einstein's
4782840	4790360	theory of spacetime and quantum field theory. So these theories assume their mathematical
4790360	4795320	theories are built on the assumption that spacetime is fundamental. So Einstein's special
4795320	4799960	relativity and quantum field theory, those mathematical, those assume that spacetime is
4799960	4805560	fundamental. So you could use the same argument. So, but notice what the physicists do is they
4805560	4811000	say our theories tell us that spacetime is doomed. Spacetime is not fundamental. Okay, well, okay,
4811000	4817960	so I'll use the same, got you logical argument. Well, so either Einstein's math modeled his
4817960	4823880	intuitions, in which case it could not possibly show that spacetime is doomed, or it didn't model
4823880	4827560	his intuitions, in which case you couldn't use it, you shouldn't use it to show that spacetime
4827560	4832280	was doomed. Well, no physicist would take that seriously. That's a, that's a silly argument.
4833720	4839560	Here's what really goes on in science. Every scientific theory makes assumptions. And there
4839560	4844440	is no theory of everything. There is no such thing as a scientific theory of everything.
4844440	4851320	So a good scientific theory starts with assumptions and basic concepts, but a good scientific
4851320	4859320	theory will tell you the limits of those concepts. Einstein's theory with quantum field theory tells us
4859320	4865640	the limits of his basic concepts, namely 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, and 10 to the minus 43
4865640	4872840	seconds, you fall apart. So what we're doing is exactly the same thing, but with evolutionary
4872840	4879720	theory, the assumptions about sure Darwin thought about physical objects in space and time. Absolutely.
4879720	4886200	What are the limits of those concepts? Well, evolutionary game theory is the mathematics,
4886200	4892760	and that mathematics is precise enough to tell us the limits of the basic concepts, just like
4893640	4899320	Einstein's theory of relativity is good enough to tell us the limitations of Einstein's notion
4899320	4905800	of space and time, or spacetime. So this is the way science works. It's not a self refutation.
4906760	4912600	To think that is actually to misunderstand fundamentally the nature of scientific progress.
4913560	4920360	Now, what you can't do is to use the old theory to tell you what's next, right? So
4920360	4926040	Einstein's theory tells us spacetime is doomed, but it can't tell you where's the next step
4926040	4931320	beyond spacetime. It can't do that. And similarly, the theory of evolution by natural selection
4931320	4937240	with the mathematics of evolutionary game theory tells you, aha, the notions of organisms in
4937240	4944280	space and time is not fundamental. But does it tell you, okay, what is more fundamental? No,
4944280	4948760	it doesn't tell you what's more fundamental. So that's where the scientists have to make a creative
4948760	4953800	leap. And physicists have done this just in the last 10 years. They went outside spacetime,
4953800	4958520	they found the amplitude, Hedron, they found decorated permutations. That's a creative leap.
4958520	4963080	But then what you do is you show how they project back into spacetime, right? You have to go back
4963080	4967880	and get your previous theories as a special case of the more general framework. And so we have to
4967880	4972760	do the same thing. Our theory of conscious agents is a leap beyond evolutionary theory.
4973480	4977240	But we have to show how it projects back into space and time and gives us back evolutionary
4977240	4984120	theory as a special case. So I'm answering your question, but I also want to answer another question
4984120	4987800	that has just been published in Sintase, you know, the philosophy journal recently.
4989960	4998200	And I just want to point out that that argument just falls flat very easily. I'll stop.
5000360	5007080	Thank you. Can we move on? We have LeMond. LeMond, did you want to ask questions?
5007960	5023400	Hi, Donald. We've corresponded before. I think I'm probably one of your biggest fans on Clubhouse
5023400	5029320	here. I was wondering if you had had any correspondence with Neema Arkani-Hamed,
5029320	5035080	because I know that you're following what they're doing in high-energy physics really closely. And
5035160	5041160	a lot of people have been, you know, begging Neema to, you know, write a book that's, you know,
5041160	5046280	more understandable for the general public, because I'm fascinated with the, you know,
5046280	5050280	decorated permutations and the amplitude hydrant. But it's so far over my head.
5050920	5055720	Could you provide any resources on how to really get a grasp on what that means?
5057320	5063320	Right. So I would love to talk with Neema. I haven't yet. And I'm hoping to actually get
5063320	5068600	to a place where I'll be worth his time. So I'm trying to, you know, the work I'm doing on these
5068600	5073640	trace chains and so forth. The decorated permutations stuff and the mark of chains onto it, I think
5073640	5077640	already might be of interest to him. But I want to push this a little bit further. His time is very
5077640	5082520	valuable. When I talk to him, I'd like, if I get the chance to talk to him, I'd like to really have
5083320	5088920	something that'll be of interest to him. But if you want to see more details, a little bit more
5088920	5095640	accessible about the amplitude hydrant and the decorated permutations is, of course, at Harvard
5095640	5102600	that he gave in the fall of 2019. So if you Google, Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One,
5104120	5110280	you will find on YouTube, they post it all 20 something 25, 20, whatever it is, lectures.
5110280	5115720	So Neema Arkani Hamid Harvard Lecture One, you'll see that he has an introductory lecture.
5115720	5121960	And he really lays it out in the introductory lecture. He tries to be fairly non-technical.
5122840	5126920	It's for a graduate class at Harvard. So, you know, non-technical for them might be technical for
5126920	5133640	the rest of us. But it's fairly accessible. And that's probably, I would say, his class and all
5133640	5138680	the lectures are online. That's maybe the most accessible source you're going to find right
5138680	5145960	now is his Harvard lectures. And I've studied, I've been studying his lectures. I've actually
5145960	5151960	transcribed 15 of them, all his first 15 lectures. I've transcribed myself personally,
5152920	5158680	equation by equation, figure by figure. I did that until COVID stopped me. COVID took me out.
5160120	5165560	But I plan to get back to it now. I'm starting to recover from COVID and go back to it. But yeah,
5165640	5169720	I'm really trying to study Neema's stuff. And, you know, I'm not a physicist.
5169720	5173000	I work with physicists. And at some point, we would love to talk with them.
5175560	5183960	Thank you. And we move on to Willie. Wonderful. Thank you, Ivy. And thank you
5183960	5190680	to have this great minds in the same room and watching your conversions at some point.
5191320	5197960	And I have two questions for each of you, one question. And it's definitely fascinating what
5197960	5205640	you are doing, God. And I say the first thing that great jumps in science are often company
5205640	5212440	of a big flock of people who don't understand what the new perspective is. So I'm also confused
5212440	5218680	sometimes by the combination of metaphors and mathematical apparatus and all this.
5219400	5225480	It's in the making, definitely. And I will take it for granted that you imply kind of
5225480	5234200	anti-realism with your stance. And I don't want to discuss it. What I want to see, if I get it right,
5234200	5242200	is that you are letting go reality and space time in a way. And starting with the fundamental of
5242760	5250120	conscious age. And we had a reading room here with these wonderful people from the
5250120	5256200	2014 article, The Origin of Time in Conscious Agents. And we found that it's a bit hard to
5256200	5263800	define or to go with you, what you mean. And it reminded me of the Floggy Stone story,
5263800	5269480	which is famous from Thomas Eskuhn about the structure of the revolution and Occup's razor
5269480	5275080	and so on. And we found out that we don't need Floggy Stone to understand that
5276440	5283880	heat is flowing from a hot point to a cold point. And so we let go Floggy Stone.
5284440	5292280	And I wonder how it can be in the same way let go reality and space time. Does it really make
5292280	5300200	sense? What are the practical and theoretical consequences in science and in life? And closing
5300200	5307240	here for your question, the old Leibniz introduced Monats in the same way as atomism just cannot
5307240	5315720	deliver the mantle. This was his basic intuition. It cannot deliver a series of emergence or
5315720	5323320	combination or composition just doesn't suffice to make us understand how this should ever work.
5323320	5331080	So I understand to go back to the primacy of the mild, definitely. But what are the predictions?
5331080	5334360	Is it detectable? Are you working on a kind of
5335640	5341800	operationable and kind of a detector, so to speak, that you can say now we can
5341880	5348680	here really see that here's a conscious agent. Sorry, it's in space time somehow,
5348680	5355080	but we can detect it and then we can count it just as an example. And then we can even see
5355080	5361240	how they emerge together or cooperate together and let time emerge. Something like this would be
5361240	5367560	very ambitious, of course. And should I go to Michael or should I just wait for you?
5368520	5373640	We really got to Michael first, because Michael got to live in time and it's time to
5373640	5384120	sort of succinctly ask your questions. So for me, also you, contrary to what Descartes was doing,
5384120	5391240	Descartes tortured cats saying that they are not sentient beings, they are just machines,
5391640	5397240	don't worry. And now we have inflation of consciousness and inflation of conscious
5397240	5403160	ancients, contrary, for instance, to even Thompson, who is preferring biopsychism,
5403160	5410840	psychism to panpsychism, only biological stuff like maybe even plants might have consciousness.
5410840	5418200	And now my question is, because you are also coming from a series of process structure like
5418200	5424760	autopoiesis in a way, but I guess you're going in a different direction. You're going into this
5424760	5432040	bioelectricity pattern. Here's my question. Are you looking for a substrate where the
5432040	5439000	self then is emergent? Because you're using the term emergent and have a different,
5439720	5447960	you have a different ontology, contrary to Don, because you are starting quite with common sense
5447960	5453960	that you are observing nature like Aristotle, Newton, Gallier, and so on. And then from this on,
5453960	5461640	you are constructing theories. And yeah, you say, I start with reality in a way, or do I get you
5461640	5467640	wrong? And the last thing, and this is again, to both of you, are you actually waiting for a new
5467640	5477160	physics, which might be even produced by Donald? Yeah, this is very exciting, because maybe this
5477160	5483800	comes together. So thank you for both of you for your answer. Yeah, thank you so much. I'm not
5483800	5491080	sure I will be able to hit all of that, but I'll try to get to some of it. The first thing I should
5491080	5501000	say is that I'm in an enjoyable position here, where on this panel, I'm not the most sort of
5501960	5510200	avant garde person here. So Don has gone further. My stuff is a little more mundane. I have not
5510200	5516520	really said anything about consciousness. I don't know anything about any new physics. I haven't
5516520	5521320	really gone there, although I'm in complete agreement with Don's view of it and where he's
5521320	5528360	going with it. I have a somewhat less ambitious thing, which is that I'm interested in cognition.
5528360	5537400	Cognition is not the same as consciousness. Cognition is, and I sort of get into this in
5537400	5545000	excruciating detail in this last tamed paper, what exactly I mean by cognition. But to address
5545000	5553640	your first point, I do think that there's way more of it, not less of it than, for example,
5553640	5559240	Descartes might have thought. I think it's actually extremely prevalent in the universe. I don't
5559240	5565320	think it is limited to things that we would call alive. I'm actually not sure what we mean by alive
5565320	5569720	necessarily, and I don't spend any time trying to figure out what this category is. Other people do,
5569720	5573960	and that's great. I spend all of my time thinking about cognition, not life, because I think there
5573960	5583560	are many things that are importantly cognitive that we may or may not call life. So that's
5584120	5589400	and I have this, and B is that I have this functional framework, it's called TAME,
5589400	5595880	which is technological approach to mind everywhere, that basically it's a very engineering
5595880	5602600	kind of approach that seeks to show you what exactly are the practical benefits of
5604200	5608600	odd cognitive lens. So it's very important to me that this is not just philosophy, that this is
5609400	5615320	all of these views are supposed to drive new discoveries, new research programs, so half of
5615320	5619560	my lab takes this stuff and turns it into interventions for biomedicine, for cancer,
5619560	5623400	for whatever, because this is not just supposed to be, well, you can look at it this way, or you
5623400	5628840	can Occam's razor it and just sort of do the science. That's actually not true. This way of
5628840	5632920	thinking about this gives rise to new experiments and new capabilities that we didn't have before.
5634600	5638280	And maybe at some point, consciousness will be folded into that. I haven't done that yet,
5638280	5644600	and so I make no claims whatsoever about consciousness yet. But I do think that
5647720	5659240	this view of basically dropping our teleophobia, we've developed through the early stages of
5659240	5665080	science this really weird fear of talking about goals and the systems that pursue goals.
5665080	5669080	And I think we need to dump that. I think that leaves so much on the table when we pretend that
5669080	5676440	doesn't exist. Since the 40s and cybernetics, we've had good theories of how you can have
5676440	5681960	non-magical goal pursuing systems. So I think it's time to kind of give up our fear of that.
5681960	5689400	And once you do that, really interesting examples of novel research programs come to light.
5689480	5694680	And bioelectricity, I think you mentioned bioelectricity. So bioelectricity happens to be
5694680	5701640	my favorite kind of cognitive glue for cells into larger systems, but it is not the only one.
5701640	5705560	I don't think it's magic. I don't think it's the only game in town. I'm sure there are other
5705560	5710840	mechanisms that play the same functional roles and who knows other places in the universe what
5710840	5717640	substrates play that role. But here on earth, what evolution has done is really exploited
5717640	5723640	bioelectricity and shown us how you can use certain features of physics and computation
5723640	5729640	to scale up cognition from very primitive goals of homeostatic little tiny systems all the way
5729640	5735480	up through human level, massive cognitive light cones. So I love bioelectricity, but it is certainly
5735480	5742920	not the only game in town for that. Thank you, Michael. Can we give a massive thank you to
5742920	5750040	Professor Levin because Professor Levin would have to leave now. So a massive thank you to
5750040	5755720	Professor Levin, everybody. Thank you so much. Thank you for having us. Great to see you, Don.
5755720	5758760	Awesome to be able to discuss this. And thanks, everybody. Thank you for your questions.
5758760	5763640	Great to see you, Mike. Thank you. See you soon. Thanks. Right. See you soon. Thank you.
5763640	5771080	Thank you. So I'll respond to the question as well. So first, the notion of reality, I would
5771080	5780520	distinguish two kinds of reality. You might say something is real if it exists, even if no one
5780520	5789640	perceives it. That would be what you might call objective reality. But that wouldn't apply to
5789640	5796200	my headache. So suppose I have a headache. Well, that headache sure seems real to me, but it would
5796280	5801720	not exist without someone perceiving it, right? So the notion of objective reality doesn't seem to
5801720	5805880	catch my headache. And if you told me my headache wasn't real, I'd be very crossed with you. I mean,
5805880	5811960	it's real to me. So I'll distinguish between objective reality versus subjective reality in
5811960	5817480	that sense. And then what I'm saying is that we thought that space, time, and physical objects
5817480	5822680	like the sun and the moon are objective reality. And all I'm saying is, no, they're a different
5822680	5826920	kind of reality. They're subjective reality. We thought that they were objective reality,
5826920	5834680	but no, they're subjective reality. And I think quantum theory, the Nobel Prize in physics last
5834680	5841480	month was awarded to three researchers who have done empirical work showing that local realism
5841480	5847720	is false. And basically, what I'm saying is local realism is false. These things are all
5847720	5851560	subjectively real. They're there when you observe, those properties are there when you observe,
5851560	5855400	and they're not there when you don't observe. They're subjectively real, but not objectively
5855400	5861880	real. So now in terms of lightness, yeah, lightness, brilliant work in monodology,
5862520	5867880	and, you know, he had the analogy of the mill where he understood the hard problem of consciousness
5867880	5872120	and dismissed it in one paragraph. He knew that you couldn't boot up consciousness from
5872120	5876360	physical systems. And it was so obvious to him he didn't think it was worth more than one paragraph
5876440	5884040	of his time to spend on it. And I agree. And so he then proposes the monodology and the
5884040	5892040	monads. And he basically says we need to start with two things, experiences and probabilistic
5892040	5898920	relationships among experiences. And I agree with lightness again. That's what we've done in our
5899640	5903320	model of consciousness. We basically model experiences and probabilistic relationships
5903400	5911720	among experiences. So lightness was there 300 years before me. And his notion of pre-established
5911720	5918280	harmony, that I think we're going to be able to model that in the way I was talking about earlier,
5918280	5923880	where I have like a big Markovian kernel for a big conscious agent. And when I take its trace
5923880	5929480	chain, there's two to the n trace chains, those are two to the n conscious agents that are all
5929480	5933480	interacting. It'll look like a pre-established harmony because they're all part from this one
5933480	5937240	big, now I can't do the trace chain on the one big conscious agent, the ultimate one. I can't do
5937240	5944040	that just because, well, Apple hasn't built a big enough laptop for me yet. But so you need to
5944840	5949960	you know, go to all of Cantor's hierarchy infinity. So Apple has a little bit of work to do ahead
5949960	5955400	for that. So we can't do that. But I sort of concede the notion of pre-established harmony
5955400	5961320	coming out of this. But it's also very useful for me to talk about conscious agents interacting in
5961320	5966920	non-trivial ways as independent agents looking at their interactions. So I mean, ultimately I think
5968680	5973000	lightness is right, but I think this other perspective is useful, given that we can't
5973000	5979240	actually model the one itself. And finally, in terms of what kinds of testable predictions,
5979560	5987960	that's what I'm working on this year. I want to, I'll be writing a paper in
5987960	5995160	in terms where we try to show that we can predict precise part-on distributions
5996680	6003080	for protons from a theory of conscious agents. So the proton, as everybody knows, is one of the
6003080	6008760	fundamental parts of the nucleus of protons and neutrons, the nucleus of atoms. The proton itself
6009560	6015960	is one of the most complicated things humankind has ever studied. It's not a trivial little ball,
6015960	6019960	and it's not just three quarks. You see three quarks, two up quarks and a down quark,
6019960	6027480	at sort of low spatial resolution, Bjork and X and low temporal resolution, Q squared. But as you
6027480	6031960	increase your spatial and temporal resolution, you find at the highest resolutions, you see
6033160	6038120	what they call a gluon C, an ocean of gluons that are appearing and disappearing. And then
6038120	6046680	as you back off, and you sort of have larger temporal scales, less temporal resolution,
6046680	6052760	then you start seeing quark, anti-quark appear or disappear. So you get this quark C, and then
6052760	6059160	finally at the crudest scale, you see the three quarks, and then some other quarks that are
6059160	6065560	appearing and disappearing. So they have momentum distributions for all Bjork and X and all Q
6065560	6073880	squareds. And I want to show that we can get all of those as artifacts of the spatial and temporal
6073880	6080680	windows of our trace chain. In other words, these particles and their properties that we're seeing
6080680	6086120	at the colliders are not an insight into a fundamental reality. All of the particles and
6086120	6092200	all of their properties are artifacts of the spatial and temporal resolution of trips by
6092200	6099080	conscious agents in their observations. So again, I could be wrong, but you're asking for a
6099960	6105240	prediction. So the thing about predictions is you can be wrong. So this is the prediction
6105240	6112440	that we're going to try to make, and we'll see where it goes. Thank you, Don. Maron, next. Great,
6112440	6122760	thank you. Thank you very much. Good to see you, Professor Hoffman. I have a question about the
6122760	6129800	problem of perception. So under the free energy principle, perception has been defined as
6130760	6137720	finding the most likely explanation or the most likely value for a hidden variable, given the
6137720	6145000	current observations that, say, we have five sensory inputs, and at time t, we are receiving
6145000	6153080	five different sensory inputs through those five channels. And given that, I'd like to
6153080	6160520	predict the most likely explanation for a hidden variable that has probably caused
6161160	6169640	those sensory inputs. Especially in artificial intelligence, when we want to create smart AI
6169640	6177000	models, particularly deep learning models, we are talking about a hierarchical structure of layered
6177000	6185080	neurons. And one of the reasons that we do that, which is also similar to what they do in predictive
6185080	6193560	coding networks, is that we are having a hierarchical structure of neurons so that we might be able to
6193560	6203960	infer the hierarchical sequence of, you know, links of causality behind, what is it, like in the
6203960	6210200	world out there that might have caused these sensory inputs, sort of model the hierarchical
6210200	6215080	structure of God knows how many hidden variables and the way they're connected to one another.
6215880	6223960	Now, if, first of all, I'd like to know whether you agree with this, like, would this be the right
6225560	6231240	at least approach, in trying to understand the complicated hierarchical structure of
6231240	6241240	hidden variables. And second of all, because, I mean, this way, it seems intractable to me to try
6241240	6249080	and sort of, you know, model, you know, potentially many, many, many such hierarchical
6249080	6253880	relationships to so that we could model the world around us because it's just too complicated.
6254440	6257080	So these are my two questions. Thank you very much.
6257160	6262520	Yeah, great, great question. So the idea of perception as Bayesian inference is, you know,
6262520	6269640	have a long history in the field. I've done some papers on that myself. There's a book called
6269640	6273160	Perception as Bayesian inference. So if you there is actually a book called Perception as Bayesian
6273160	6279560	inference by edited by David Nill and Whitman Richards and Whitman Richards was my PhD advisor.
6279560	6284040	And I have a paper in that book. So I'm very interested. And that's a 1996 book. So it's
6284040	6289480	quite old now, but it's, I've been interested a long time in Bayesian inference models of
6289480	6294760	perception. And I think that they're quite powerful. Most of my colleagues who are doing that are
6294760	6300120	assuming that space and time is fundamental reality and that we're, the Bayesian inference was,
6300120	6305720	we're actually finding the true physical substrate behind our perceptions. And I think that that
6305720	6311160	whole thing is that that interpretation of Bayesian inference is mistaken. And if you go to the,
6311160	6317400	you know, predictive processing, predictive coding kind of thing and the work on Bayes Nets,
6317400	6328360	for example, and the implications there, what you see is the nodes inside a markup blanket
6328920	6332360	appear to be doing this kind of, you know, Bayesian estimation.
6335480	6338280	Whenever I say something that sounds like Siri, Siri on my phone starts,
6339080	6344040	anyway. So, but, but, but here's the key thing that, that, that we know about Bayes Nets.
6344840	6350440	The, even though it looks like the nodes on the inside are doing some kind of Bayesian inference
6350440	6357480	about the world states, we know that the states of the nodes on the inside and the states of the
6357480	6364600	nodes on the outside of the markup blanket are conditionally independent, given the state of
6364600	6373000	the markup blanket. That means the only thing that the nodes on the inside can never, can ever
6373000	6380360	know about the external world is the information on the markup blanket. So that whole framework tells
6380360	6386760	you that you're only seeing an interface. The markup blanket is your interface and you're not,
6387480	6391320	when you're doing this predictive processing, you're not predicting, you're not estimating the
6391320	6395960	true state of the world. You're doing something on an interface and you're using only interface
6395960	6401320	variables. So you never see the truth and you're not estimating the truth. And it's just right
6401320	6406840	there in the actual, you know, the fact that a markup blanket is the set of nodes that makes the
6406840	6410840	internal nodes and external nodes conditionally independent. That means you can't know anything
6410840	6416920	more about the external nodes, except what you see on your markup blanket. So, so it just really
6416920	6420680	highlights what I've said from Evolution of a Natural Selection and what the physicists are
6420680	6427720	telling us. Not fundamental. Evolution tells us it's just an interface and so does the markup
6427720	6434680	blanket. It tells you it's just an interface. So they all agree. Thank you very much. Thank you,
6434680	6442760	Don. John, did you have any questions for Don? Thank you, Ivy. Yeah, I, the one thing I guess I,
6443720	6454920	as a physicist, I confess, I, the one part, I like, I love your Windows interface analogy,
6454920	6463560	you know, and I, and I think that's really powerful. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry, not doing,
6464760	6471880	but I feel like, I feel like I can't quite make the leap to, you know, my experience in the world.
6471880	6478520	And so for instance, the things that I have trouble with is kind of extending that to the idea that
6478520	6484520	I can both see things and feel things and I can travel to those things that I see and touch them
6484520	6489640	and other people can too. And they have the same experience. And I don't know, maybe I'm,
6490680	6497080	I just feel like I'm missing something there. And I wonder if you have anything to help me over that.
6497640	6507160	Sure. Sure. I think, I think the virtual reality metaphor is a big, big help here. So for people
6507160	6514120	who are playing multiplayer, so multiplayer VR games. So I'm, I'm playing with somebody in China
6514120	6519080	and, you know, in Germany and in Argentina, we're all playing Grand Theft Auto together.
6519080	6524040	And we can all agree that, oh yeah, I, you know, Hoffman is racing against a red Porsche and the
6524040	6529560	red Porsche is, you know, is 20 meters ahead of Hoffman. And we all agree. So we have consensus.
6529560	6534120	And, and, and they might be giving me advice. You say, you know, Hoffman, you do a hard left there,
6534120	6539160	there's a shortcut, you can beat him, something like that. So we have consensus and it looks like
6539160	6543000	there's this objective reality, but we know that there is no red Porsche anywhere. There's just
6543000	6547960	some supercomputer and we're toggling bits. So, so when the physicists like Nima or Connie Hamid
6547960	6554280	tell us that space time is doomed, right? That it's not fundamental reality. There, but they're
6554280	6559160	going beyond, they're saying, okay, there is a reality beyond space and time. And by the way,
6559160	6564840	beyond quantum theory. And but, but they're saying that quantum theory itself is not fundamental.
6565400	6570760	So, so the new structures that they're finding, like the amplitude, there are no Hilbert spaces there.
6571720	6581000	But the apple to Heaton is this high dimensional geometric object with facets and faces and edges
6581000	6586840	and vertices. And it turns out that the properties of space time and quantum theory, locality and
6586840	6594840	uniterity are coded in the face structure of these geometric objects beyond space time. So, so, so
6594840	6599000	this is so the physicists themselves, and this is only in the last 10 years. So most, by the way,
6599160	6605880	I was at a conference on consciousness, just a couple months ago, where a number of physicists
6605880	6610680	who are quantum theorists, so they're their PhDs in quantum theory. And they're looking at
6610680	6615080	consciousness. At the end of their talks, every one of them I asked, now, are you aware of these
6615080	6619560	structures beyond space time, the amplitude, hedron and the decorated permutations, and to a
6619560	6626040	person, they had never heard of it. Now, now, now, the reason is, is this is high energy physics,
6626040	6632120	right? Only people who are in high energy physics, right, know about this stuff. And, you know, so
6632120	6636280	why does a cognitive scientist know about it? Well, because I knew I needed to look for something
6636280	6641000	beyond space time. So I've been looking for physics beyond space time. And when I found Nima,
6641000	6646600	Arkanian, and their work, I realized, okay, okay, the other ones that would be doing it, they're
6646600	6650200	the ones that are pushing the envelope with the highest energies, right? They're the ones
6650200	6656920	that are going there. So it's, and it's Nima who's saying quantum theory is doomed, not just
6656920	6662200	space time, but quantum theory, that both of those are going to arise together. Because if you think
6662200	6668200	about it, the particles, right, some people are trying to boot up space time from like entanglement
6668200	6673720	of particles, right? But what are particles? Particles are irreducible representations of the
6673720	6679160	Poincare group of the symmetries of space time. So you're not getting outside of space time,
6679240	6685080	you're just staying in. So, so quantum theory does not get you behind space time. In fact,
6685080	6689080	all the weirdness of quantum theory, the fact you need superpositions and collapse and all this
6689080	6696680	stuff is a symptom of an interface. It's the fact that you've lost information in projection.
6696680	6701080	That's why we get the weirdness of quantum theory and the no cloning theorem and all that stuff
6701080	6707320	is all an artifact of space time not being fundamental. And there's this deeper reality.
6707320	6712440	So now where physics is right now is, so the amplitude hydrant, so here's something for a
6712440	6719240	physicist. If you do the scattering amplitude computation, say for two gluons smashing into
6719240	6723800	each other, four gluons spraying out, you do it in space time using quantum field theory.
6724680	6730280	There's hundreds of pages of algebra, nasty, nasty math. If you do it with the amplitude hydrant,
6731240	6736600	three or four terms, you can compute it by hand. The math becomes trivial. Well,
6736600	6744200	relatively trivial. It's all relative. But trivial compared to what you have to do with
6744200	6750360	Feynman diagrams. And the other kicker is, you see new symmetries. There's something called the
6750360	6755720	infinite Yangian symmetry that's true of the scattering, but you cannot see it in space time.
6755720	6760600	You can only see it when you go beyond space time. So when the physics, when the physicists
6760600	6764520	find that the math is getting simpler and you're seeing new symmetries, bye-bye space time.
6767720	6769400	Well, I'll be sorry to see it go.
6771560	6774680	Well, it's a wonderful headset. It's been a useful headset.
6775240	6780200	Thank you. Do you want to, do you know it?
6781800	6787480	Yeah, very quickly, Donald, you didn't talk about the hard problems, consciousness. It seems to me,
6787480	6792280	in fact, that that problem still remains as a problem because you essentially created a
6792280	6797880	mathematical model of, you know, the effects of consciousness, not the consciousness, but the
6797880	6803320	effects of consciousness, where the sentience, the sentience is coming into play in probably all
6803320	6808680	the way you're kind of portraying the reality. Can you just very quickly tell us something about
6808680	6814440	this? Because I feel that experience is something that you cannot, you cannot convert it into any
6814440	6820840	kind of model. That is my view. Right, right. So the hard problem is that it comes up if you,
6820840	6823960	if you assume the space and time are fundamental and you're trying to figure out how, for example,
6823960	6829640	something like neural activity could cause conscious experiences. And there, I've got many
6829640	6834200	friends and colleagues who are working in that direction and they're brilliant, but it's impossible
6834200	6839560	to solve that problem. And the failure is clear. There's, you know, there's, for example, integrated
6839560	6843080	information theory. What is the integrated information that must be the taste of chocolate
6843080	6847960	or the smell of garlic? There's not a single one that they can do. Same thing with the orchestrated
6847960	6852360	collapse of microtubules. There's not a single specific conscious experience that they can explain.
6852360	6857000	And I predict I'd bet good money that they'll never be able to do it because it's just impossible.
6857000	6863560	Lightness was right. It's impossible. So, so for me, I don't have the hard problem of consciousness
6863560	6868040	because I'm not trying to boot up consciousness from non-conscious ingredients. I'm saying that
6868040	6872760	that whole approach is wrong. So I've got the reverse hard problem. I have to, I have to show,
6872760	6877240	if I start with consciousness, so I'm assuming consciousness, I have to show you how I give
6877240	6883160	you physics in all detail. So I'm doing the reverse hard problem. And that's why I said my goal this
6883160	6889320	year is to predict the parton distributions for all the quarks and gluons and so forth inside the
6889320	6894200	proton. In other words, that's my reverse hard problem. So I agree that we need to solve it,
6894200	6898840	but I have to go in the other direction. That one, I think, is feasible. And by the way,
6898840	6906600	my current simulations are already very, very, they're, they're encouraging. At small temporal
6906600	6914760	scales, I get a gluon C, a massless particle C appearing. And as I increase the temporal scales,
6914760	6921640	I get a C of small, increase the temporal scale even more, I start getting bigger particles with
6921640	6928280	greater math. So I get the, I've already in my simulations got the big picture now. But my goal
6928280	6932920	is not just the big picture. I want to get the exact momentum distributions. But already, my,
6932920	6939000	my current simulations tell me, you know, this is in a very profitable direction.
6941160	6945000	Thank you, Dan. Can we move on to Ethan Prillock?
6945640	6946120	Yeah.
6946120	6947880	Go straight to your question, please.
6947880	6953240	Yeah, well, we had asked it about Delbrook earlier. And I'm just curious about comments as to how
6953240	6957080	you have additions or subtractions or how similar it is. Thank you.
6957720	6961880	Well, just briefly, I mean, Delbrook did a lot of things. So what specific idea about Delbrook's
6961880	6962840	did you want me to comment on?
6965000	6969080	Yeah, I mean, he talked about evolution, not really providing for something that we should
6969080	6975160	expect to understand, you know, the fitness function as modeling, real underlying reality.
6976280	6981640	So, so I'm not familiar with that. So he actually said that, that the notion of a fitness function,
6981640	6984520	the fitness payoff function is not a useful tool, you're saying?
6985400	6989000	He said it wouldn't really, we shouldn't expect it because of the way evolution works,
6989480	6994520	to represent the underlying reality. But he didn't, you know, he didn't talk about it in terms of,
6994520	6998360	you know, operating systems, of course, we didn't really have any of the potentials.
6998360	7001960	Oh, I see. So you're saying that he was sort of agreeing with me that he was saying that
7002760	7006920	we shouldn't expect evolutionary grounds that we don't see reality as it is. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
7006920	7007640	Absolutely.
7007640	7011800	And he was a student also of some of the great modern, he was a doctoral student of
7011800	7015720	you, one or two of the great modern physicists before he became a biologist.
7016680	7020760	Right. So, so yeah, and I think he was not a reductionist, and I'm not a reductionist either.
7020760	7027240	So, so I, so I'll just say, yes, I agree with Delbroque on that. And he is absolutely my superior
7027240	7034040	in terms of his knowledge of molecular biology. And then my other one quick question too is,
7034040	7038120	in terms of the stuff that you were talking about these formalisms, is there anything that would,
7038120	7043560	if we stay on the side of the Planck limits, that would make a demarcation about describing
7043640	7048280	features of the universe in, you know, a prebiotic situation or a proto-ecology?
7048840	7051960	And is there anything that would show something like that?
7055160	7060440	Well, what I think is going to happen from the simulations I'm doing is that as I
7061480	7065080	increase the windows, the spatial and temporal windows of the trace chains that I,
7065080	7070680	that I do, I will get more and more complicated behaviors. And so I'm doing particles
7070680	7074120	because that's the most trivial thing. I mean, I'm doing the physics is,
7074840	7078200	it's going to be the easiest thing. And it's also where we have the most data, right? The
7078200	7081880	physicists have been doing these scattering experiments for decades. And so we have tons
7081880	7087320	of data. And so I'm not going after the physics because I think that that's the final thing or
7087320	7091240	the most important thing is, it's the thing that you can do first. And you can get,
7091240	7095400	but I eventually want to show how as we go to larger scales of these trace chains,
7095400	7102120	we will then be able to see like the emergence of cells and organisms and greater organization.
7102120	7106760	But that's more complicated. If I went after that first, I wouldn't have anything to report.
7107560	7112520	I need to do the physics where we actually have a shot at getting a concrete result.
7112520	7119160	Thank you, Don. Can we move on to Tony, please quickly? Yeah, it's going to be Don's last question.
7120120	7127560	Okay. Let me try to add something useful. How you relate physics or fundamental physics,
7127560	7132280	particle physics and consciousness. This part is still not clear to me.
7133080	7140120	Okay. So, so the, we just published a paper last week that you can take a look at it. It's
7140120	7146120	called Fusions of Consciousness. So if you just Google my name, Donald Hoffman and fusions of
7146120	7152600	consciousness, it's available free online and you'll read how we make the connection. But what
7152600	7161160	I'll say at the top level is what we show in that paper is that communication or communicating classes
7161160	7170760	of conscious agents correspond or what are being catalogued by decorated permutations.
7170760	7174040	So the physicists found these decorated permutations beyond space time,
7174040	7178360	these decorated permutations account for most of the data about scattering in space time.
7178920	7183560	So we said, okay, if, if decorated permutations are the deepest thing the physicists have found
7183560	7187240	beyond space time, let's take our theory of consciousness and project it onto decorated
7187240	7193800	permutations. And we did. So that's, so we introduced new mathematics, the mathematics that
7193800	7198440	takes Markov chains and maps them to decorated permutations is brand new in our paper. So that's
7198440	7203400	a new contribution as far as I can tell to mathematics. And that tells us now that particles
7203400	7210360	in space time correspond to communicating classes of conscious agents. So that's, so that paper
7210360	7215000	establishes that part in way we're clear in the paper, we're proposing that particles in space
7215000	7222360	time are projections of communicating classes of conscious agents. So in the next paper that
7222360	7229400	we're working on, I'm going to we're planning to now make specific mapping. So for example,
7229480	7235240	what properties of communicating classes correspond to the mass of a particle? And there,
7236120	7240040	I mentioned earlier, so my proposal, and this is not published, so I'm telling you what we're
7240040	7246040	working on. And if you can beat me to it, go ahead and publish it. That'd be fine. I don't
7246040	7249400	care who publishes, I just want to read the papers. I just want to know this stuff. So,
7249400	7254280	so I'm putting my ideas out there and someone who's a lot of people are smarter than me in
7254280	7258200	this area. So you can run with it and I'll be happy to read your paper. What we're proposing
7258200	7268840	is that the entropy rate of a communicating class corresponds to the mass. And the number of states
7269640	7277560	in the communicating class will will lead almost immediately or momentum and wavelengths. So,
7277560	7281080	so those are the things that we're looking at right now, but we're going to write up, we're
7281080	7287160	writing a paper, tentatively called traces of traces of consciousness, where we use these
7287160	7292440	trace chains and show how particles arise as artifacts of the trace process. And all of their
7292440	7298520	properties arise like the they'll then be artifacts like the entropy rate of the Markovian kernel
7298520	7303080	that happened to arise as an artifact of the trace chain process, that will be the mass that you see.
7303720	7309720	So, so that's how I'm proposing to get physics. All of the particles and all the properties
7309720	7314760	are not fundamental reality, they are artifacts of the way we observe.
7317160	7320680	Statistical artifacts and we're going to, and that's not just a hand wave, we're going to say now
7320680	7326360	exactly what the statistics are and exactly how those properties emerge as the artifacts and why you
7326360	7333400	get like bosons first and then only later does it condense into fermions and so forth. That
7333400	7340840	that's all going to fall out of this, so. Thank you, Don. I have a very small question if I may.
7341800	7348680	I will cry otherwise on stage. I'm sorry, Madej, we have to stop the interview now.
7349720	7356360	Don, have to go. So, can we all give a massive thank you to Don for today, for his time, please.
7357880	7361000	Don, thank you so much. It's been amazing. Thank you very much.
7361800	7367240	Thank you, Don. Thank you so much. We'll see you later.
7370200	7372200	Bye bye. Bye bye.
7391000	7391800	you
