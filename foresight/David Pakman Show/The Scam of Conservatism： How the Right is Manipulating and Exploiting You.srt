00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
I want to talk today about the scam of modern conservatism and how the right is manipulating

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,400
and exploiting people with an ideology that exists only in theory and in reality is completely

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,400
different from that which it claims to be. Let me explain. Modern conservatism is a political

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,080
ideology that claims to be about limited government, individual liberty and responsibility,

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,720
traditional values, freedom, not regulating businesses on and on and on. And there's two

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,080
parts of this. The first part is that in theory, all of that sounds really appealing. It's sort of

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,640
like, Hey, doesn't paying no taxes sound appealing in some general sense? I mean, yeah, I'd love to

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,280
keep every dollar that I gross and not pay any taxes in some general sense. That sounds pretty

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:02,640
good. It sounds appealing in certain contexts. The ideas espoused by conservatism sound beneficial.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,480
But in practice, modern conservatism has become a scam that is used to manipulate and exploit people

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,120
and its values are just as quickly abandoned by those espousing them once they are no longer

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,600
convenient or productive or helping their costs. Let's talk about some examples. One way that

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,360
modern conservatism is being used to manipulate the public is through propaganda and misinformation.

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,840
Conservative media outlets and politicians will often spread misleading information

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,320
based on their supposed principles in order to win elections. At the end of the day, all they care

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,640
about is winning elections. And this includes conspiracy theories when it's convenient,

17
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,920
cherry picking data, using completely loaded language to evoke an emotional response. We're

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,640
pro life. Wow, everybody else must be against life. That sounds pretty bad. We're for tax relief.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Wow. Taxes must just simply be oppressive. Taxes must be like slavery, which is quite literally

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,960
what some libertarians say. And by using this language and manipulating the public's understanding

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,800
of the facts, conservatives shape public opinion and influence policy decisions and voters in their

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,320
favor in ways that are completely misleading and don't actually benefit the people that end up voting

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,720
for them. And that's a big part of the scam. And we're going to get back to that. Another way that

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,080
the public is exploited by the scam of conservatism is through dog whistle politics. So this is when

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,840
they use coded language that certain groups of people understand to have a specific meaning. Like

26
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,760
for example, when they say family values, I mean, that sounds pretty good, right? Like families are

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,840
good in values that support families. That all sounds good. But it's a signal to conservative

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,840
voters. You're supposed to be opposed to same sex marriage. You're supposed to be supposed to

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,000
abortion. More recently, you're supposed to be opposed to even fundamental just basic trans rights.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,880
They don't say it outright. And this allows the right wing politicians to appeal to certain groups

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,400
of voters without alienating others. It allows them to avoid accountability. And it allows

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,720
something that Donald Trump actually did very well, which is you kind of take every position on issues.

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,360
And even if you don't overtly do it, you leave enough vagaries that anybody could sort of stumble

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,400
across some version of a position that they agree with you or at least don't overtly disagree.

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Modern conservatism also exploits the public through policy. And this is maybe the most important

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,640
thing. Right wing conservative, whatever word you want to use for it, policy disproportionately

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,280
benefits the wealthy, the powerful and those with what we might call like standard or agent

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,280
identities in American society. And conservatives will argue lower taxes are good for everybody.

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,960
Increases economic growth, increases prosperity, rising tide lifts all boats. They'll say it with

40
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,120
regulation. Reducing regulation is good for everybody. Economic growth, prosperity, it's great.

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,080
The truth is it's a scam. Those very policies, they do particularly in the short term increase

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,920
profits for corporations and the wealthy, but they externalize the burden of the pollution

43
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,920
that is created or the low wages that are paid, which then we all have our taxes go to social

44
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,000
welfare programs to support people who rightly need those programs because the corporations are

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
paying low wages. They claim it's good for everybody. Their economic policy is good for

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,200
everybody, but it leads to cuts in social services or increased spending on social services,

47
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,000
higher health care costs, lower wages for workers. We all pay for it. We are getting

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,800
scammed by it. So modern conservatism is a scam that by scamming the public and exploiting the

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,240
public through all of the things I mentioned, disproportionately benefits the elites. They

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,640
love to say Democrats are all about this elitist cabal. That's that's all they care about.

51
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,320
It's actually conservatism that is doing that. Couple modern examples. We can look at how right

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,880
wingers sought to undermine the legitimate legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.

53
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,080
There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that impacted the results. They scammed their

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,200
supporters. They raised money. Trump did claiming we're going to use the money to flip the election.

55
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,400
He kept the money, used it to pay off campaign debt, total and complete scam.

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,880
We've seen these conspiracies promoted by conservative media outlets

57
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,080
and by politicians, by Trump himself. And that is the prototypical example of how conservatism

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,520
is used to make the public think a certain thing and then get them to take an action,

59
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,760
either going to the Capitol, donating money, whatever the case may be.

60
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,200
We have also seen, by the way, this very same rhetoric used in order to get the public to

61
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,120
support ideas that are seemingly completely antithetical to the values of the right.

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,200
For example, free speech for all, including for businesses until we no longer like the speech

63
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,960
and moderation rules that are being applied on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. And all of a

64
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
sudden freedom, liberty and low regulation goes out the window and it's we must force Facebook

65
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,760
to publish our COVID disinformation. We must force Twitter to publish the pictures of Hunter

66
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:58,000
Biden's genitalia. They abandoned those principles right away and the voters at the end of the day

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,240
are just getting scammed. They don't know up, down, left, right. They don't know what's going on.

68
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:12,320
Last thing on this, when you wonder what is the end game with any of these supposedly

69
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,080
conservative policy ideas, whether it's the immigration reform ideas, they have taxation,

70
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:25,280
whatever the case may be, understand that the end goal is to reinforce and perpetuate

71
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,240
the rich and corporations maintaining power and profitability. That is the big scam that they

72
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,520
claim their entire movement is a set of policies that helps everyone and it doesn't. And we've

73
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,200
talked before about how that is that is not completely missing from the Democratic Party,

74
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,440
but the degree to which it exists in the modern right wing movement is completely stunning.

75
00:07:51,440 --> 00:08:00,560
It is a scam. Last week, we spoke about what it is about people who are victimized by scams

76
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,720
that keeps them being victimized and part of it is the cult aspect and part of it is psychological

77
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,360
factors. We looked at the people being scammed. Now we've looked at what the scam is and it would

78
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,280
be great if people would figure this out and stop falling for it. But it actually is a party that

79
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,520
depends on people continuing to fall for it.
