I want to talk today about the scam of modern conservatism and how the right is manipulating

00:07.280 --> 00:14.400
and exploiting people with an ideology that exists only in theory and in reality is completely

00:14.400 --> 00:20.400
different from that which it claims to be. Let me explain. Modern conservatism is a political

00:20.400 --> 00:28.080
ideology that claims to be about limited government, individual liberty and responsibility,

00:28.080 --> 00:34.720
traditional values, freedom, not regulating businesses on and on and on. And there's two

00:34.720 --> 00:40.080
parts of this. The first part is that in theory, all of that sounds really appealing. It's sort of

00:40.080 --> 00:46.640
like, Hey, doesn't paying no taxes sound appealing in some general sense? I mean, yeah, I'd love to

00:46.640 --> 00:53.280
keep every dollar that I gross and not pay any taxes in some general sense. That sounds pretty

00:53.280 --> 01:02.640
good. It sounds appealing in certain contexts. The ideas espoused by conservatism sound beneficial.

01:03.200 --> 01:10.480
But in practice, modern conservatism has become a scam that is used to manipulate and exploit people

01:11.040 --> 01:17.120
and its values are just as quickly abandoned by those espousing them once they are no longer

01:17.120 --> 01:23.600
convenient or productive or helping their costs. Let's talk about some examples. One way that

01:23.600 --> 01:31.360
modern conservatism is being used to manipulate the public is through propaganda and misinformation.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.840
Conservative media outlets and politicians will often spread misleading information

01:38.480 --> 01:44.320
based on their supposed principles in order to win elections. At the end of the day, all they care

01:44.320 --> 01:48.640
about is winning elections. And this includes conspiracy theories when it's convenient,

01:49.440 --> 01:55.920
cherry picking data, using completely loaded language to evoke an emotional response. We're

01:55.920 --> 02:02.640
pro life. Wow, everybody else must be against life. That sounds pretty bad. We're for tax relief.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.280
Wow. Taxes must just simply be oppressive. Taxes must be like slavery, which is quite literally

02:09.280 --> 02:14.960
what some libertarians say. And by using this language and manipulating the public's understanding

02:14.960 --> 02:20.800
of the facts, conservatives shape public opinion and influence policy decisions and voters in their

02:20.800 --> 02:26.320
favor in ways that are completely misleading and don't actually benefit the people that end up voting

02:26.320 --> 02:30.720
for them. And that's a big part of the scam. And we're going to get back to that. Another way that

02:30.720 --> 02:38.080
the public is exploited by the scam of conservatism is through dog whistle politics. So this is when

02:38.080 --> 02:43.840
they use coded language that certain groups of people understand to have a specific meaning. Like

02:43.840 --> 02:49.760
for example, when they say family values, I mean, that sounds pretty good, right? Like families are

02:49.760 --> 02:55.840
good in values that support families. That all sounds good. But it's a signal to conservative

02:55.840 --> 03:01.840
voters. You're supposed to be opposed to same sex marriage. You're supposed to be supposed to

03:01.840 --> 03:08.000
abortion. More recently, you're supposed to be opposed to even fundamental just basic trans rights.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.880
They don't say it outright. And this allows the right wing politicians to appeal to certain groups

03:14.880 --> 03:20.400
of voters without alienating others. It allows them to avoid accountability. And it allows

03:20.400 --> 03:26.720
something that Donald Trump actually did very well, which is you kind of take every position on issues.

03:26.800 --> 03:33.360
And even if you don't overtly do it, you leave enough vagaries that anybody could sort of stumble

03:33.360 --> 03:38.400
across some version of a position that they agree with you or at least don't overtly disagree.

03:39.200 --> 03:45.200
Modern conservatism also exploits the public through policy. And this is maybe the most important

03:45.200 --> 03:52.640
thing. Right wing conservative, whatever word you want to use for it, policy disproportionately

03:52.640 --> 03:59.280
benefits the wealthy, the powerful and those with what we might call like standard or agent

03:59.280 --> 04:07.280
identities in American society. And conservatives will argue lower taxes are good for everybody.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.960
Increases economic growth, increases prosperity, rising tide lifts all boats. They'll say it with

04:12.960 --> 04:19.120
regulation. Reducing regulation is good for everybody. Economic growth, prosperity, it's great.

04:19.760 --> 04:28.080
The truth is it's a scam. Those very policies, they do particularly in the short term increase

04:28.080 --> 04:35.920
profits for corporations and the wealthy, but they externalize the burden of the pollution

04:35.920 --> 04:43.920
that is created or the low wages that are paid, which then we all have our taxes go to social

04:43.920 --> 04:50.000
welfare programs to support people who rightly need those programs because the corporations are

04:50.000 --> 04:54.240
paying low wages. They claim it's good for everybody. Their economic policy is good for

04:54.240 --> 04:59.200
everybody, but it leads to cuts in social services or increased spending on social services,

04:59.200 --> 05:04.000
higher health care costs, lower wages for workers. We all pay for it. We are getting

05:04.000 --> 05:12.800
scammed by it. So modern conservatism is a scam that by scamming the public and exploiting the

05:12.800 --> 05:18.240
public through all of the things I mentioned, disproportionately benefits the elites. They

05:18.240 --> 05:22.640
love to say Democrats are all about this elitist cabal. That's that's all they care about.

05:22.640 --> 05:28.320
It's actually conservatism that is doing that. Couple modern examples. We can look at how right

05:28.320 --> 05:32.880
wingers sought to undermine the legitimate legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.

05:32.880 --> 05:38.080
There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that impacted the results. They scammed their

05:38.080 --> 05:43.200
supporters. They raised money. Trump did claiming we're going to use the money to flip the election.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.400
He kept the money, used it to pay off campaign debt, total and complete scam.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.880
We've seen these conspiracies promoted by conservative media outlets

05:50.880 --> 05:58.080
and by politicians, by Trump himself. And that is the prototypical example of how conservatism

05:58.080 --> 06:05.520
is used to make the public think a certain thing and then get them to take an action,

06:05.520 --> 06:09.760
either going to the Capitol, donating money, whatever the case may be.

06:11.120 --> 06:19.200
We have also seen, by the way, this very same rhetoric used in order to get the public to

06:19.200 --> 06:25.120
support ideas that are seemingly completely antithetical to the values of the right.

06:25.760 --> 06:33.200
For example, free speech for all, including for businesses until we no longer like the speech

06:33.840 --> 06:38.960
and moderation rules that are being applied on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. And all of a

06:38.960 --> 06:45.440
sudden freedom, liberty and low regulation goes out the window and it's we must force Facebook

06:45.440 --> 06:51.760
to publish our COVID disinformation. We must force Twitter to publish the pictures of Hunter

06:51.760 --> 06:58.000
Biden's genitalia. They abandoned those principles right away and the voters at the end of the day

06:58.000 --> 07:02.240
are just getting scammed. They don't know up, down, left, right. They don't know what's going on.

07:02.960 --> 07:12.320
Last thing on this, when you wonder what is the end game with any of these supposedly

07:12.320 --> 07:18.080
conservative policy ideas, whether it's the immigration reform ideas, they have taxation,

07:18.080 --> 07:25.280
whatever the case may be, understand that the end goal is to reinforce and perpetuate

07:26.160 --> 07:34.240
the rich and corporations maintaining power and profitability. That is the big scam that they

07:34.240 --> 07:41.520
claim their entire movement is a set of policies that helps everyone and it doesn't. And we've

07:41.520 --> 07:47.200
talked before about how that is that is not completely missing from the Democratic Party,

07:47.200 --> 07:51.440
but the degree to which it exists in the modern right wing movement is completely stunning.

07:51.440 --> 08:00.560
It is a scam. Last week, we spoke about what it is about people who are victimized by scams

08:00.560 --> 08:06.720
that keeps them being victimized and part of it is the cult aspect and part of it is psychological

08:06.720 --> 08:13.360
factors. We looked at the people being scammed. Now we've looked at what the scam is and it would

08:13.360 --> 08:17.280
be great if people would figure this out and stop falling for it. But it actually is a party that

08:17.280 --> 08:19.520
depends on people continuing to fall for it.
