0	7280	I want to talk today about the scam of modern conservatism and how the right is manipulating
7280	14400	and exploiting people with an ideology that exists only in theory and in reality is completely
14400	20400	different from that which it claims to be. Let me explain. Modern conservatism is a political
20400	28080	ideology that claims to be about limited government, individual liberty and responsibility,
28080	34720	traditional values, freedom, not regulating businesses on and on and on. And there's two
34720	40080	parts of this. The first part is that in theory, all of that sounds really appealing. It's sort of
40080	46640	like, Hey, doesn't paying no taxes sound appealing in some general sense? I mean, yeah, I'd love to
46640	53280	keep every dollar that I gross and not pay any taxes in some general sense. That sounds pretty
53280	62640	good. It sounds appealing in certain contexts. The ideas espoused by conservatism sound beneficial.
63200	70480	But in practice, modern conservatism has become a scam that is used to manipulate and exploit people
71040	77120	and its values are just as quickly abandoned by those espousing them once they are no longer
77120	83600	convenient or productive or helping their costs. Let's talk about some examples. One way that
83600	91360	modern conservatism is being used to manipulate the public is through propaganda and misinformation.
91360	97840	Conservative media outlets and politicians will often spread misleading information
98480	104320	based on their supposed principles in order to win elections. At the end of the day, all they care
104320	108640	about is winning elections. And this includes conspiracy theories when it's convenient,
109440	115920	cherry picking data, using completely loaded language to evoke an emotional response. We're
115920	122640	pro life. Wow, everybody else must be against life. That sounds pretty bad. We're for tax relief.
123440	129280	Wow. Taxes must just simply be oppressive. Taxes must be like slavery, which is quite literally
129280	134960	what some libertarians say. And by using this language and manipulating the public's understanding
134960	140800	of the facts, conservatives shape public opinion and influence policy decisions and voters in their
140800	146320	favor in ways that are completely misleading and don't actually benefit the people that end up voting
146320	150720	for them. And that's a big part of the scam. And we're going to get back to that. Another way that
150720	158080	the public is exploited by the scam of conservatism is through dog whistle politics. So this is when
158080	163840	they use coded language that certain groups of people understand to have a specific meaning. Like
163840	169760	for example, when they say family values, I mean, that sounds pretty good, right? Like families are
169760	175840	good in values that support families. That all sounds good. But it's a signal to conservative
175840	181840	voters. You're supposed to be opposed to same sex marriage. You're supposed to be supposed to
181840	188000	abortion. More recently, you're supposed to be opposed to even fundamental just basic trans rights.
188000	194880	They don't say it outright. And this allows the right wing politicians to appeal to certain groups
194880	200400	of voters without alienating others. It allows them to avoid accountability. And it allows
200400	206720	something that Donald Trump actually did very well, which is you kind of take every position on issues.
206800	213360	And even if you don't overtly do it, you leave enough vagaries that anybody could sort of stumble
213360	218400	across some version of a position that they agree with you or at least don't overtly disagree.
219200	225200	Modern conservatism also exploits the public through policy. And this is maybe the most important
225200	232640	thing. Right wing conservative, whatever word you want to use for it, policy disproportionately
232640	239280	benefits the wealthy, the powerful and those with what we might call like standard or agent
239280	247280	identities in American society. And conservatives will argue lower taxes are good for everybody.
247280	252960	Increases economic growth, increases prosperity, rising tide lifts all boats. They'll say it with
252960	259120	regulation. Reducing regulation is good for everybody. Economic growth, prosperity, it's great.
259760	268080	The truth is it's a scam. Those very policies, they do particularly in the short term increase
268080	275920	profits for corporations and the wealthy, but they externalize the burden of the pollution
275920	283920	that is created or the low wages that are paid, which then we all have our taxes go to social
283920	290000	welfare programs to support people who rightly need those programs because the corporations are
290000	294240	paying low wages. They claim it's good for everybody. Their economic policy is good for
294240	299200	everybody, but it leads to cuts in social services or increased spending on social services,
299200	304000	higher health care costs, lower wages for workers. We all pay for it. We are getting
304000	312800	scammed by it. So modern conservatism is a scam that by scamming the public and exploiting the
312800	318240	public through all of the things I mentioned, disproportionately benefits the elites. They
318240	322640	love to say Democrats are all about this elitist cabal. That's that's all they care about.
322640	328320	It's actually conservatism that is doing that. Couple modern examples. We can look at how right
328320	332880	wingers sought to undermine the legitimate legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election.
332880	338080	There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that impacted the results. They scammed their
338080	343200	supporters. They raised money. Trump did claiming we're going to use the money to flip the election.
343200	346400	He kept the money, used it to pay off campaign debt, total and complete scam.
346960	350880	We've seen these conspiracies promoted by conservative media outlets
350880	358080	and by politicians, by Trump himself. And that is the prototypical example of how conservatism
358080	365520	is used to make the public think a certain thing and then get them to take an action,
365520	369760	either going to the Capitol, donating money, whatever the case may be.
371120	379200	We have also seen, by the way, this very same rhetoric used in order to get the public to
379200	385120	support ideas that are seemingly completely antithetical to the values of the right.
385760	393200	For example, free speech for all, including for businesses until we no longer like the speech
393840	398960	and moderation rules that are being applied on Twitter or Facebook or whatever. And all of a
398960	405440	sudden freedom, liberty and low regulation goes out the window and it's we must force Facebook
405440	411760	to publish our COVID disinformation. We must force Twitter to publish the pictures of Hunter
411760	418000	Biden's genitalia. They abandoned those principles right away and the voters at the end of the day
418000	422240	are just getting scammed. They don't know up, down, left, right. They don't know what's going on.
422960	432320	Last thing on this, when you wonder what is the end game with any of these supposedly
432320	438080	conservative policy ideas, whether it's the immigration reform ideas, they have taxation,
438080	445280	whatever the case may be, understand that the end goal is to reinforce and perpetuate
446160	454240	the rich and corporations maintaining power and profitability. That is the big scam that they
454240	461520	claim their entire movement is a set of policies that helps everyone and it doesn't. And we've
461520	467200	talked before about how that is that is not completely missing from the Democratic Party,
467200	471440	but the degree to which it exists in the modern right wing movement is completely stunning.
471440	480560	It is a scam. Last week, we spoke about what it is about people who are victimized by scams
480560	486720	that keeps them being victimized and part of it is the cult aspect and part of it is psychological
486720	493360	factors. We looked at the people being scammed. Now we've looked at what the scam is and it would
493360	497280	be great if people would figure this out and stop falling for it. But it actually is a party that
497280	499520	depends on people continuing to fall for it.
